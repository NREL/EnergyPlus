## Justification for New Feature ##
Energy use by miscellaneous electric loads (MELs) has become a growing portion of energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings in the U.S. and worldwide. Currently,  EnergyPlus reports aggregated plug loads (under General end-use subcategory) without a way to break it down into major subcategories such as set-top boxes, TVs, PCs, etc. reported in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) [1]. This new feature proposal will implement end-use subcategorization to enable detailed MELs energy calculations and reporting in EnergyPlus to support GEBs research and application of tools such as Scout. The MELs categorization will be standardized based on previous research, DOE appliances standards, building energy codes and standards, as well as their significance in total energy use.

## Overview ##
EnergyPlus, up to version 9.5, reports major energy uses as shown in Table 1 where MELs are aggregated into the Interior Equipment end-use category.

<p style="text-align: center;">Table 2 EnergyPlus report end-uses by categories and subcategories</p>

Based on the above justifications, we propose to add a categorization for MELs which cover major plug loads in residential and commercial buildings.

## Approach ##
To enable the reporting of MELs in EnergyPlus, the ElectricEquipment will be augmented with more refined end-use subcategories: the field End-Use Subcategory (A5) will change from alpha to choice types, including major residential and commercial building electrical equipment categories.
