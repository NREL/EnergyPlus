**Task Description**:

**Ability to properly model and control water-side economizers for self contained units** - Ability to model water side economizer in AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem which enables free cooling and switching of DX compressor in that object.
## Justification for New Feature ##


Manufacturers have a configuration option that includes free cooling using a cooling coil dedicated to waterside economizing connected to the condenser plant (e.g., cooling towers). The cooling coil is upstream of a DX cooling coil which reduces the DX compressor energy use in cooling mode. EnergyPlus does not currently have a mechanism to properly model control of this configuration.

## E-mail and  Conference Call Conclusions ##

Brent 1/15/21

I would suggest to change CoilSystem:Cooling:DX to CoilSystem:Cooling and allow that parent to use chilled water coils.  Seems hard to justify yet-another-coil-system object.  Or add the controls needed to unitary system and model with two unitary objects in series.

MJWitte 1/19/21

1. I like adding CoilSystem:Cooling:Water because it can be used for more than this application.
2. In theory, one could use AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem with just one coil and no fan, but it still wouldn't have the extra control offset field, and it's become so large that a focused object makes more sense.
3. One could overthink (not me, of course) the naming and think about how all of the existing CoilSystem objects relate to each other. Some of them have controls in them, some do not (*:HeatExchangerAssisted).
4. These all started with CoilSystem:Cooling:DX because we needed a way to control a dx coil that was loose on the branch. Using CoilsSystem for this was perhaps a confusing choice because of the overlap with CoilSystem:*:HeatExchangerAssisted.
5. Some consolidation might be nice, but why? Look at how hard it's been to accomplish that with the DX coils and UnitarySystems. Oh, right, we haven't. So, perhaps better to keep the set of objects and move towards a common code base for them (i.e., they're all part of the same class).
6. So, I guess I'm convincing myself that the proposed object name is ok as-is.
7. I'm fine with leaving off the sensor node.
8. The MultiMode dehumidification control maybe should have a different name. It's only for activating an HXassisted coil, right?

RR: Yes, MultiMode would be used for the HX. If that choice were used the HX would cycle on based on need, otherwise it would always be on. HeatExchangerControlled may be more accurate.

MJWitte: Or HeatExchangerControl or ActivateHeatExchanger. I think including HeatExchanger in the option name is good. If some other way of controlling humidity comes along then a new option can be added.

MJWitte Comment on Github: 04/29/21
@rraustad has demonstrated a method for the AirLoopHVACX:UnitarySystem code to simulate CoilSystem:Cooling:DX in #8729. It should be possible to do the same here with the small addition of support for the cutoff
temperature difference. That means this feature will not need a new source file, just a new input function in UnitarySystem. This may reduce (or eliminate) the need for changes in other source files as well.

MJWitte added that, my vision of this is that CoilSystem:Cooling:Water would be just an abbreviated synonym for AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem. It would instantiate a unitarysystem internally and that code will do all the work. 
With that approach, there's no need for CoilWaterSystem.hh or cc

B Bigusse on Github: 04/29/21: Agreed to use Mike's suggestion. This appraoch is a minimal code changes in the get input to track that the unitarysystem is intended as a water-side economizer, sets a flag if the condition is favorable 
for economizer to operate and if logics to turn off the UnitarySystem if the condition is not favorable. So, the new codes added does not change any existing controls but sets a control flgas to be able to turn on or 
off the system coil depending on the condition.


## Overview ##

The waterside economizer is used as a pre-cooling coil in packaged DX equipment.

**The following description was excerpt from Trane Product Catalog PKG-PRC024D-EN**.

The waterside economizer substantially reduces the compressor energy requirements because
it uses the cooling water before it enters the condensers. Disadvantages include higher airside pressure drop and a higher head on condenser water pumps.

![Figure 1 Schematic of waterside economizer](NFP-Waterside-Economizer-Fig01.PNG)

**Figure 1 Schematic of waterside economizer (Extracted from Trane Product Catalog)**


**Unit Operating Limits**

**Airflow**:
The minimum recommended airflow for proper VAV system staging and temperature control is 35 percent of nominal design airflow. Adjusting VAV boxes with the appropriate minimum settings prevents the self-contained unit from operating in a surge condition at airflows below this point. Continuous operation in a surge condition can cause fan failure.
Note: Contact your local Trane sales office for minimum airflow conditions.

**Water Flow**: Use 3 gpm/ton for optimum unit capacity and efficiency. Use 2.5 or 2 gpm/ton to reduce pump energy, cooling tower, and piping costs. However, these reduced water flows may impact unit capacity and efficiency by one or two percent. Consult factory for unit specific water flow ranges.

**Supply Air Temperature Control Unit Sequence of Operation
1** — Occupied Supply Air Temperature Control Cooling/Waterside Economizer
During occupied cooling mode, the waterside economizer option and mechanical cooling are used to control the supply air temperature. The supply air temperature setpoint is user defined.
After the fans run for 5 minutes, and a call for cooling is calculated, the Cooling Tower/Pump Command is turned on. After the Condenser Water flow switch closes proving flow, the
Compressors and/or Economizer will be allowed to start.
Waterside economizing enables when the unit’s entering water temperature is less than the
entering mixed air temperature. This is set at Waterside Economizer Enable Offset setpoint. The factory default is 7°F, but can be adjusted by the user.

The economizer acts as the first stage of cooling. If the economizer is unable to maintain the supply air setpoint, the unit controller will bring on the compressors as required to meet the setpoint. If the unit does not include an economizer, only mechanical cooling will satisfy cooling requirements.

**Discharge Air Cooling Setpoint** The Discharge Air Cooling Setpoint default valve of 55 degrees and the unit will control to this value when in the cooling mode. The setpoint can be adjusted 3 different ways.

 - Reset Based on Return Air Temperature: The Discharge Air Temperature can be reset based off the return air temperature which will work to keep this temepature between its heating and cooling setpoints.
 - Reset Based on Zone Temperature: The Discharge Air Temperature can be reset based off the return air temperature which will work to keep this temepature between its heating and cooling setpoints.
 - Reset Based on Zone Temperature: Zone reset is applied to the zone(s) in a building that tends to overcool or overheat. The supply air temperature setpoint is adjusted based on the temperature of the critical zone(s).This can have the effect of improving comfort and/or lowering energy usage.The user-defined parameters are the same as for outdoor air reset.

**End Trane Product Catalog excerpt**.


**Note**: The set point control methods will remain the responsibility of existing EnergyPlus SetPointManagers.

## Approach ##

The waterside economizer is simply a water coil with special controls. The coil is not active if the entering coil air temperature is not sufficiently higher than the entering water temperature by some user specified value (e.g., 7 °F or 3.89 °C) and is controlled to a set point temperature. These controls must be "actuated" by some means. Since the existing UnitarySystem already has 3 coils within the parent, the initial  proposal is to wrap the existing water cooling coils in a parent object and place this new object upstream of the UnitarySystem to achieve the goal of free cooling. There are several coil wrappers in EnergyPlus as follows:

    CoilSystem:Cooling:DX
    A6,  \field Cooling Coil Object Type
         \key Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed
         \key CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted
         \key Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed
         \key Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode
         \key Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
         \key Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage

    CoilSystem:Heating:DX,
    A3,  \field Heating Coil Object Type
         \key Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed
         \key Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed

    CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted,
    A2 , \field Heat Exchanger Object Type
         \key HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate
         \key HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent
    A4 , \field Cooling Coil Object Type
         \key Coil:Cooling:Water
         \key Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry

    CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted,
    A2 , \field Heat Exchanger Object Type
         \key HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate
         \key HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent
         \key HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow
    A4 , \field Cooling Coil Object Type
         \key Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed
         \key Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed

It may be time to begin consolodating these exising wrappers as done with the Coil:Cooling:DX object. The name would simply be CoilSystem and contain any type of coil with an optional heat exchangera available for cooling coils. This big of a change may be too big for this task, however, keeping this in mind for this new object is highly desireable.

**Instead of incorporating a waterside economizer coil object into a packaged system, a generic method of providing free cooling is discussed here. The new object would be configured as a condenser plant demand side component and placed upstream of any existing coil types. A new wrapper will be developed to include the water coils. This wrapper could be specific to a new waterside economizer coil object or be more generic to allow branch water coils to be simulated without using the Controller:WaterCoil object. The more generic method is described here.**

**Note**: This new object may also be used on the demand side of a cooling plant to support existing coil types.

Several considerations need to be resolved for this new object.

 - Should a Sensor Node Name input field be included, or force use of the object or coil outlet node (recommended and agreed to via comments)
 - Should a controller tolerance input field be included or assume a typical value of 0.001 for temperature control and 0.00001 for humidity control (no comments, assumed OK)
 - If the CoilSystem objects are consolidated, additional inputs would be needed for Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil (A11) and Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil Leaving Minimum Air Temperature (N1) to replicate all inputs for CoilSystem:Cooling:DX. Additional inputs would also be required for heat exchanger type and name. (discouraged via comments)

## Testing/Validation/Data Sources ##

                             int const &airLoopNum,       // index to AirloopHVAC
                             int const &branchNum,        // index to AirloopHVAC branch
                             int const &compNum           // index to AirloopHVAC branch component
    );
	

Adds new simulate call using override for HVACSystemData::simulate:

            ...
