## Justification for New Feature ##

LowTemperatureRadiant and BaseBoard objects in EnergyPlus currently has design and control fields lumped together. This results in a large number of fields for these objects as seen below:
 - The `ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:VariableFlow` object has 34 fields
 - The `ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow` object has 34 fields
 - The `ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:RadiantConvective:Water` object has 17+ fields*
 - The `ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:RadiantConvective:Steam` object has 17+ fields*
 
 Lumping of design and control parameters together results in many of the variables being repeated for every zone which could have been instead shared among the zones. Lumping everything together is also less organized and causes confusion for the users. There have been requests from users to split these objects into design and control variables. 

Splitting the objects into design and control variables may result in 

 1. Increased ease of creating new objects, with fewer fields to fill in. 
 2. Decreased confusion from too many fields. This may also result in fewer errors caused by decreasing the many variables. 
 
 (*The number of fields will increase with the number of surfaces) 

## E-mail, Conference Call, Other Communications and Conclusions ##

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Center for the Built Environment(CBE) at the University of California Berkeley requests this new feature. The original request is like below:

"Potentially separate the lowtemp:radiant objects such that one main object contains the design parameters of the radiant system (e.g. amount of tubing, hot and chilled water loop connections), while the other contains the control parameters (e.g. two position, modulating, zone circulator pump, etc.)." (Quote from CBE)   Right now, all of the parameters associated with a radiant system in EnergyPlus are contained in a single input syntax.  The concern here is that much of the control information is probably pretty similar from system to system within a single user input file.  So, there could be less work and smaller files if the input was broken up into two separate inputs, allowing many radiant systems to re-use a single control definition.  This could potentially be applied to other input syntax beyond the low temperature radiant systems.

Conversation with E+ Team on Slack:
1. Create a design object for each radiant temp and baseboard object.
2. Maybe name the design object to something else.

##### Comment #####
Project to end by April 2021 since Jermy's internship ends by May 2021. 

### Approach/Design Rationale ###

The proposed approach is to identify the design variables in the LowTemperatureRadiant and Baseboard objects and create separate design objects for the LowTemperatureRadiant and Baseboard objects.

### Outputs Description ###

No changes. 

## Engineering Reference ##

No changes. 

## Example File and Transition Changes ##

All of the current example files that use `ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:VariableFlow`, `ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow` and `ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:RadiantConvective:Water`, `ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:RadiantConvective:Steam` will be modified so that the design and parameters are different.

## References ##

None.

## Next Steps ##

 1. Get feedback from the EnergyPlus team regarding naming the design object to something else. 
 2. Start coding.

## Proposed changes to the IDD file ##

The metadata to remain same, so it was taken out to improve readability.
