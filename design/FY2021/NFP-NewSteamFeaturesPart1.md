## Justification for New Feature ##

It is common for university campuses and cities like New York to use steam to heat hot water loops. Often, steam energy is transferred at the building to a hot water system via a heat exchanger. Currently, EnergyPlus users can make both steam and hot water systems, but cannot link them together. This forces modelers to use HW boilers/systems to approximate the steam systems, which isn’t accurate and reduces confidence in the energy model. The request for a steam to water heat exchanger came from Bractlet. Also, there have been several upvotes on the new feature request regarding steam to water heat exchanger from EnergyPlus Github.
In addition, the current EnergyPlus does not allow to use of district heating steam (except for `SteamEquipment`) and `LoadProfile:Plant` in a steam loop. 
This PR enables EnergyPlus to simulate `DistrictHeatingSteam`, and `LoadProfile:Plant` in a steam loop. (`HeatExchanger:SteamToWater` is going to be available in Part 2.)

## E-mail and Conference Call Conclusions ##

EnergyPlus Technicalities Call on 2/24/2021
- We only have one phase of steam plant fluid modeling. There is a lot of room for improvement and basic validation of the current steam plant.
- If we are going to add more complexity to remove assumptions, we need new ways to find those values; for example, how do we calculate the quality if we want to remove the quality 0 & 1 assumption?
- New systems could use the current assumption for now. And if CoolProp is implemented, the steam systems can be renewed with an enthalpy-based system.

EnergyPlus Iteration Call on 2/2/2022
- Instead of a separate object (PlantLoadProfile:Steam), a few optional input fields for a steam loop should be added to the current object (PlantLoadProfile).
- As for DistrictHeating, separate object should be fine since steam and water use different source factors.

EnergyPlus Technicalities Call on 2/9/2022
- Currently, there is `steam` as a resource type. This should be changed to `DistrictHeatingSteam`.
- Current `DistrictHeating` should be `DistrictHeatingWater`.
- In IDD and input parts, `DistrictHeating:Water` and `DistrictHeating:Steam` should be used.
- As for meter names, `DistrictHeatingWater` and `DistrictHeatingSteam` are better than `DistrictHeating:Water` and `DistrictHeating:Steam` because full meter names are a combination of resource type, end-use, etc. which are joined by colons so another colon would be confusing.
- Keep these `DistrictHeatingWater` and `DistrictHeatingSteam` separate for output report since hot water and steam basically have different source factors and emission factors.
- `SteamEquipment` should go on the same meter as this `DistrictHeatingSteam`
- As for Steam to Water Heat Exchanger, we stick with two explicit objects because it's better from the user standpoint.

## Overview ##

The current steam loop in EnergyPlus has five objects: steam boiler, steam pipe, steam to air coil, steam baseboard radiator, and condensate pump. The steam loop has several assumptions that help simplify loop complexity and increase usability.

1. Steam side of the loop operates on constant saturation pressure of steam

2. Water side (condensate) of the loop operates at atmospheric pressure

3. Steam loop is to operate in saturated conditions, and no superheated condition

4. Steam loop is assumed to have no transportation losses by friction and heat transfer with surroundings so that it maintains the quality of steam throughout the system constant value of 0 or 1

5. Boiler operation is assumed to generate steam at a quality equal to 1 every time and steam enters the coils at boiler outlet conditions

6. Steam coils are designed with steam traps, which only allow condensed steam to leave the coil; hence the steam always condenses and leaves the coil at a quality of 0

These assumptions are applied to the new objects: `LoadProfile:Plant` in a steam loop, and `DistrictHeatingSteam`. If CoolProp is implemented in the future, the steam systems can be renewed with an enthalpy-based system.

## Approach ##

1. `LoadProfile:Plant` in a steam loop :
The current LoadProfile:Plant calculates the outlet water temperature based on the inlet water temperature from the plant loop and user inputs for the scheduled plant load and the requested flow rate. 
In the new LoadProfile:Plant, there are three additional input fields: Plant Loop Fluid Type (Water or steam); Degree of SubCooling (optional input for steam loop); and Degree of Loop SubCooling (optional input for steam loop). The new LoadProfile:Plant in a steam loop calculates the steam outlet mass flow rate based on the scheduled plant load and user inputs of degree of subcooling, because the inlet steam temperature and the outlet steam temperature before the steam trap are fixed to saturation temperature according to the assumption.

2. `DistrictHeating:Steam` :
The current DistrictHeating or DistrictCooling calculates the output capacity required from the inlet temperature to the setpoint temperature for the loop with the given mass flow rate in Watts.
The DistrictHeatingSteam calculates the required output capacity based on the latent heat at the given saturation temperature.
The current object name and meter names of DistrictHeating are changed to DistrictHeatingWater.


## Testing/Validation/Data Sources ##

1. Standard unit tests are used to verify the new modules.
2. Test performance of the new modules with example test files.
