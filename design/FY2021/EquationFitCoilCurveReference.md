## Background ##

Excerpts lifted from [issue #8352](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues/8352)

 - The EquationFit coil objects (like `Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit` and `Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit`) have curve coefficients embedded in them. 
  
 - But other coil objects refer to standalone curve objects instead.
 
 - Embedded coefficients limit the flexibility of using EMS to model coil performance impact when needed.

 - Changing EquationFit coils to reference curve objects also allows the user to use different equation forms and to use lookup tables. (From [Mike Witte](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues/8352#issuecomment-724140062))

## Coil Objects Need to change##

- Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit

- Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit

- HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling

- HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating

## Curve Objects Needed ##
- For `Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit`, there're **quad-linear** curves and **quint-linear** curves used to describe coil performances. However, currently only **quad-linear** curves are existing.

## Decision to Make ##

### Add quint-linear curve object? ###
As described above, both quad-linear and quint-linear curves are needed for  Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit, while other coils only require quad-linear curves. In order to satisfy Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit curve specifications, we can either:
 - Add quint-linear curves so that the curve type of every curve referred can be explicitly specified. This is a more straightforward path to move forward to.
 - Change quad-linear curves to be more general as "multi-linear" or simply replace it by quint-linear curves, regarding to the similarity between quad-linear and quint linear curves. Users can simply add 0 coefficients to whatever variables that are not important or E+ can only read specific number of coefficients for specific input. Notice that there's no tri-linear or bi-linear curve types in Energyplus which might imply some preference to this approach in its first place (Is that true? Any example of using quad-linear curve type to read in tri-linear curves?).

 
## Approach ##

Once the above decision are made:

 - A new curve type will be added or current curve type will be modified in Curve and other curve related codes/data structures. The curve will be very similar to current quad-linear curve, eg.
 ```

  0.,                ! Minimum Curve Output
  5.;                ! Maximum Curve Output
```

 - EquationFit coil/heatpump models will be changed to refer to curves instead of reading in embedded coefficients.

## Testing/Validation/Data Sources ##

There's potentially going to be many string diffs, but numbers should all remain the same.

## Input Output Reference Documentation ##

There's potentially many doc changes required.

## Example File and Transition Changes ##

And transition will be required.

 - For all of the test files that use above coil/heatpump objects.
