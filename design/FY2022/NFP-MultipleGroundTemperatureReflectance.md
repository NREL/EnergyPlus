 - First draft: April 26, 2022
 - Modified Date: May 6, 2022
 - Added Design Document, May 16, 2022
 

## Justification for New Feature ##

Currently EnergyPlus only allows one single ground surface with user defined ground solar reflectance and ground temperature. Each exterior surface has a single view factor to ground. A real building usually sees multiple types of ground surfaces, e.g., bare soil, grass, sidewalks, driveways, water surface, which may have different solar reflectance and ground temperature.

**- The new feature was requeted by LBNL **

**- this feature is intended for use with exterior surfaces only **

## E-mail and  Conference Call Conclusions ##

- technicalities call: May 4, 2022

- technicalities call recap is on github.

- additional comments and responses on github PR #9409

## Overview ##

### Current Code ###

(1) Exterior surface LWR exchange with the ground is calculated using outside air dryblub temperature (default)

(2) Currently single ground surface temperature can be specified using `SurfaceProperty:SurroundingSurfaces` object 

(3) Existing model uses global Site:GroundReflectance object

**- This enhancement allows each exterior surfaces to see different ground surface temperature and reflectance objects.

## Implementation Approach ##

*(1) This new feature oe enhancemnt can be implemented using an existing object and one new Object:

     Existing object: `SurfaceProperty:LocalEnvironment`

     New Object: `SurfaceProperty:GroundSurfaces`
	 
	 The new object will have multiple ground surfaces properties of ground view factor, ground temperature and ground reflectance
	 
	 Ground surfaces are assumed horizontal surfaces for solar reflection calculations and relected solar radiations are assumed diffuse.
	 
*(2) Requires modifying SurfaceProperty:LocalEnvironment object:

     Add a new field `Ground Suraces Object Name` to this object. This field will be used to specify the name of the new object.

*(3) Two redundant input fields in SurfaceProperty:SurroundingSurfaces will be deprecated

*(4) Ground surfaces are assumed horizontal surfaces for solar reflection calculations

## Input Output Reference Documentation ##

\subsection{SurfaceProperty:GroundSurfaces}\label{surfacePropertyGroundSurfaces}

This object is used for calculating building exterior surfaces long-wave radation exchange with the ground, and calculation of solar radiation reflection from ground surfaces to a building exterior surface. A given exterior surface can view multiple ground surfaces with different surface properties and view factors. Thus, this object allows to specify multiple ground view factors, ground surfaces temperature, and ground surfaces refelectance properties viewed by a given exterior surface. View factors are assumed to be constant values. The ground surface temperature and ground surface reflectance are specified using schedule object. At least one ground surface should be defined in this object.

The sum of all defined view factors that includes sky virew factor, ground surfaces view factors and surrounding surfaces view factors seen by a given building exterior surface should be 1.0, or the sum of the ground view factors for a given exterior surface should not exceed 1 minus the sky view plus the sum of view factors of surrounding surfaces defined in SurfaceProperty:SurroundingSurfaces object.

\subsubsection{Field: Name}\label{field-name}

This is a unique name of the surface property ground surfaces object.

\subsubsection{Field: Ground Surface 1 Name}\label{field-ground-surface-1-name}

This is a unique name for ground surface 1. 

\subsubsection{Field: Ground Surface 1 View Factor}\label{field-ground-surface-1-view-factor}

This field defines the constant ground view factor of a building exterior surface to ground surface 1. The ground surface view factor is used in long-wave radiation exchange and ground surface solar reflectance calculations.

\subsubsection{Field: Ground Surface 1 Temperature Schedule Name}\label{field-ground-surface-1-temp-schedule-name}

This field is used to provide a schedule name of the ground surface 1 temperature. The ground surface temperature used in long-wave radiation exchange calculation of a building exterior surface with the ground surface. If the field is left blank, the default method will be used.

\subsubsection{Field: Ground Surface 1 Reflectance Schedule Name}\label{field-ground-surface-1-reflectance-schedule-name}

This field is used to provide a schedule name of the of a ground surface reflectance. The ground surface reflectance is used to calculate ground surface reflected solar radition to a building exterior surface. If the field is left blank, the global reflectance object defined else where or default values will be used.

This object is extensible, so the last four fields can be repeated to define ground surface name, ground surface view factor, ground surface temperature, and ground surface reflectace sets.

Ground surfaces solar reflectance values derived from satelite data for common surfaces obtained from Ground Albedo Measurements and Modeling (Bill Marion, 2018) are summerized in table below.

### External Longwave Radiation ###

The total longwave radiative heat flux is the sum of components due to radiation exchange with the ground, sky, air, and surrounding surfaces.

\begin{equation}
{q''_{LWR}} = {q''_{gnd}} + {q''_{sky}} + {q''_{air} + {q''_{sur_surf)}}
\end{equation}


Long-wave radiation exchange of a building exterior surface with multiple ground surfaces is given by:

\begin{equation}
{q''_{gnd}} = \varepsilon \sigma \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{N_{gnd_surfaces}}} {F_{gnd,j}} \left(T_{gnd,j}^4 - T_{surf}^4 \right)
\end{equation}

where

$\varepsilon$ = long-wave emittance of a building exterior surface

$\sigma$ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant

F\(_{gnd, j}\) = view factor of a building exterior surface to jth ground surface

T\(_{gnd, j}\) = jth ground surface temperature

T\(_{surf}\) = building outside surface temperature

N\(_{gnd_surfaces}\) = Number ground surfaces seen by a building exterior surface


The above equation can be recast using multiple ground surfaces average temperature seen by an exterior surface as follows:

\begin{equation}
{q''_{gnd}} = \varepsilon \sigma \{F_{gnd, sum}} \left(T_{gnd,avg}^4 - T_{surf}^4 \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{F_{gnd,sum}} = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{N_{gnd_surfaces}}} {F_{gnd,j}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{T_{gnd,avg}} = ((\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{N_{gnd_surfaces}}} {F_{gnd,j}} \left(T_{gnd,j}^4)) / \{F_{gnd,sum}})^{{1/4}}
\end{equation}

where

T\(_{gnd,avg}\) = view factor weighted average surface temperature of multiple ground surfaces seen by an exterior surface

F\(_{gnd,sum}\) = sum of the view factors of an exterior surfaces to multiple ground surfaces 


### Ground Surfaces Solar Reflectance ###

Ground reflected solar radiation is calculated for beam and diffuse components separately.

\subsection{Sky Solar Radiation Diffusely Reflected from the Ground}\label{sky-solar-radiation-diffusely-reflected-from-the-ground}

The diffuse irradiance received on a building exterior surface due to sky solar radiation reflected from multiple ground surfaces at each time step is given by:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
{QRadSWOutIncSkyDiffReflGnd(RecSurfNum)} = \\{DifSolarRad * {\rho_{gnd,avg}} * SurfReflFacSkySolGnd(RecSurfNum)~ (W/m^{2})}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

where
rho\(_{gnd,avg}\) = view factor weighed ground solar reflectance of multiple ground surfaces seen by an exterior surface

The view factor weighted average reflectance of multiple ground surfaces is calculated from the ground refelctances and view factors of the ground surfaces seen by the exterior surface and is given by:

\begin{equation}
{\rho_{gnd,avg}} = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{N_{gnd_surfaces}}} {\rho_{gnd,j}} * {F_{gnd,j}} / \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{N_{gnd_surfaces}}} {F_{gnd,j}}
\end{equation}

where

rho\(_{gnd, j}\) = reflectance of the jth ground surface seen by an exterior surface


\subsection{Beam Solar Radiation Diffusely Reflected from the Ground}\label{beam-solar-radiation-diffusely-reflected-from-the-ground}

The beam radiation is assumed to be reflected uniformaly to all directions. The diffuse irradiance received by a building exterior surface due to beam solar diffusely reflected from multiple ground surfaces is given by:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
QRadSWOutIncBmToDiffReflGnd(RecSurfNum) =
\\BeamSolarRad * {\rho_{gnd, avg}} * (WeightNow * SurfReflFacBmToDiffSolGnd(RecSurfNum,HourOfDay)
\\+ WeightPreviousHour * SurfReflFacBmToDiffSolGnd(RecSurfNum,PreviousHour))
\end{split}
\end{equation}


## Example File and Transition Changes ##

An example file will be modified to demonstrate the use of multiple ground surface objects. Simulation results will be examined and sample results will be provided.

Transition is required to remove two redundant fields in SurfaceProperty:SurroundingSurfaces object. These redundant fields are "Ground View Factor" and "Ground Temperature Schedule Name".

## Proposed Report Variables: ##

Output variables applicable to SurfaceProperty:GroundSurfaces object are:

Zone,Average,Surfaces Property Ground Surfaces Average Temperature [C]
Zone,Average,Surfaces Property Ground Surfaces Average Reflectance []


Surfaces Property Ground Surfaces Average Temperature [C]
This is average surface temperature of multiple ground surfaces in deg C viewed by an exterior surface for each time step. If there is only one ground surface specified in a given SurfaceProperty:GroundSurfaces object, then the average surface temperature will be the same as the specified ground surface temperature.


Surfaces Property Ground Surfaces Average Reflectance []
This is average surface reflectance of multiple ground surfaces viewed by an exterior surface for each time step. If there is only one ground surface specified in a given SurfaceProperty:GroundSurfaces object, then the average surface reflectance will be the same as the specified ground surface reflectance.

### Note: ###

The ground surfaces temperature and reflectance are used for exterior surfaces only. Ground surfaces average temperature and average reflectance are used when the multiple ground surfaces are specified. Averaging the ground the temperature and reflectance values does not impcat results.
