## Justification for New Feature ##

The existing AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass model, a constant volume flow system, uses a bypass duct to short-circuit excess supply air back to the inlet of the unit. The following figure from the Engineering Reference illustrates the use and location of the bypass duct.

With this configuration the treated supply air that bypasses the zones mixes with the return air prior to entering the outdoor air mixer. At the higher bypass fractions this can lead to unreasonably low or high air temperatures entering the OA mixing box. When the AirloopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem is used external to this model (upstream of the Air Inlet Node in the previous figure), mixing the bypass air in this fashion (i.e., after the external OA Mixer) leads to unexpected economizer operation since the true mixed air temperature entering the external OA Mixer would be different had the bypass air been mixed prior to the external OA Mixer.

Tiejun Wu at Carrier was the first to notice this problem and last year offered corrective suggestions:

    5/30/2018 - 1. Air side economizer. Thermodynamically this configuration is different from a
                   real configuration where the bypass mixer is upstream of the OA mixer. When bypass
                   flow ratio is low, the difference is small, but when bypass flow ratio is high, the
                   difference is significant.  This may trigger economizer to start operation at a
                   higher outdoor temperature than it normally would.
                2. “LoadPriority” control option. Currently there are “CoolingPriority”, “HeatingPriority”
                   and “ZonePriority” control options. With these options, the system could easily
                   get stuck in a mode or frequently cycling between cooling and heating mode.
                   In the attached Carrier VVT control sequence, the mode of operation is determined
                   by comparing the total zone cooling demand and heating demand (page 24).
                   System changeover is based on both a mode change request and minimum elapsed time in a mode.
                3. Model ceiling plenum bypass and return. In field application, many VVT system use
                   a ceiling return plenum configuration. With this configuration, the bypass air will get
                   discharged into the ceiling plenum and then mix with zone return air before flow back to
                   the unit. The current unitary system object assumes adiabatic ducted bypass which may
                   underestimate the system load when used to model a ceiling plenum return configuration.
                   Attached please find a Carrier VVT bypass system layout diagram (Figure 42 and 43 on page 35).

    Suggestions: 1.  Model an air side economizer properly.
                 2.  Add a priority control mode “LoadPriority” with minimum run time setting in a mode.
                 3.  Allow modeling of ceiling plenum bypass and return. 

The solution to the above mentioned problem is to move the internal bypass duct away from the model and mix the bypass air using an AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum or AirloopHVAC:ZoneMixer (if a plenum is not used). Figure 2 represents the proposed enhancement to the Changeover Bypass model. The bypass duct leaves the system at the Bypass Duct Splitter Node and connects to existing air loop mixing objects.

###Proposed Enhancement Summary:

 1.  Allow AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass object to be connected to a return plenum or zone mixer.
 2.  Expand priority control type options to include LoadPriority and minimum time limit.


 
## E-mail and  Conference Call Conclusions ##

3/28/2019 - Provide initial schematic of proposed changes to select individuals for review.

3/28/2019 - Initial response from Tiejun agrees that these changes would address the underlying issue.

3/29/2019 - provide Initial draft NFP

4/1/2019 - Edwin commented:

    1 - Like the DOAS to multiple AHU, I feel concerned about extra iteration required to handle this situation where you are coupling nodes together
    2 - Presumably in figure 2 you don't need a zonemixer because the return plenum collects the zone return nodes 
    3 - in figure 2 it mentions the internal OA mixer will have flow set to zero when using an AirLoopHVAC:OASys -- is there already a precedent for this? Does the solution algorithm rely on there being an OA mixer internal there? Seems like it could be a chance to remove some calculations that aren't necessary.

4/2/2019 - Answers to Edwin's questions:

    1 - Well, it seems adding another node to the mixer or plenum is no different than adding another zone. I am not sure if additional iterations would be needed since if the flow to the zones converges then so does the bypass flow.
    2 - Figure 2 is missing the notation of the mixer (forgot to update the figure in the media folder). So the Changeover Bypass VAV model (CBVAV) can connect to either a mixer (when no plenum is used) or a plenum (when no mixer is needed).
    3 - In CBVAV the internal mixer is required because this is where the bypass was mixed and making the internal OA mixer optional would have made things harder [I think]). Setting internal OA mixer flow = 0 is more of a suggestion since sizing won't be able to handle both OA streams. Using both would also introduce excess outdoor air. User could specify both OA flow's if desired, it's just not how a unit in the field would be configured. Not sure yet how many, if any, calculations could be skipped.


## Overview and Approach ##

When a user connects the HVAC system's bypass duct to a return plenum or mixing box, the internal calculation of the mixed air stream conditions will no longer be required. The model will check to determine if the splitter node is used as an inlet node in the return plenum or zone mixer object. If so, inlet air conditions will be passed directly to the mixed air node. If not, and as the model currently does now, a mixing problem is used to determine the mixed air node conditions.

*Pros* - Backward compatibility with previous model configuration, enhanced economizer operation and more realistic configuration with real world applications.

*Cons* - May increase simulation time to correctly model mixed conditions at air loop inlet. 

## Code Design and Programming ##

EnergyPlus currently assumes the air flow at the outlet node of an air loop is the same as the inlet node. This enhancement will allow a bypass duct to divert air from the Changeover Bypass system before the outlet node such that the outlet node air flow rate will differ from the inlet node. The bypass duct will connect to either an AirloopHVAC:Mixer or AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum. The bypass duct flow rate will be included in the comparison of MassFlowRate versus MassFlowRateSetPoint at the outlet node of the air loop. Specifically in ResolveAirLoopFlowLimits. AirLoopFlow.BypassMassFlow is 0 for all other equipment models.

```
if ((Node(SupplyNode).MassFlowRateSetPoint - Node(SupplyNode).MassFlowRate - AirLoopFlow(AirLoopIndex).BypassMassFlow) < -HVACFlowRateToler * 0.01) {
```

The use of a bypass duct may increase the number of iterations required to converge on a solution. This is because the inlet node of the air loop, or inlet (return) node of the AirloopHVAC:OutsideAirSystem does not get updated until the zone equipment (AirloopHVAC:ZoneSplitter, AirloopHVAC:ZoneMixer, and zone equipment) is simulated. However, this is also the case with other existing HVAC models. Attempts to envision a design where bypass duct conditions are passed to the air loop inlet automatically are elusive given that the zone equipment must be simulated to get mixed air information correct.

Code changes will employ the same methodology used in the existing HVACUnitaryBypassVAV.cc module.
