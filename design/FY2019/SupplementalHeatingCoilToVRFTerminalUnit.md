Add Supplemental Heating Coil to ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow
=================================================================

**Bereket Nigusse, FSEC**

 - 20 March 2019 - Original NFP
 - N/A - Revision

## Justification for New Feature ##

ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow currently does not support supplemental heating coils. Some VRF technologies support supplemental heating coils in their terminal units. Besides, it is provides flexibility for users to model a self contained VRF systems to meet heating demand instead of specifying standalone zone heating equipment.

## Overview and Approach ##

The arrangements shown in Figure 1 is supplemental heating coil placement for draw-though and blow-through supply fan placement configuration in VRF air terminal unit.

![Figure 1 VRF Air Terminal Unit with supplemental heating coil and draw-through and blow-through Fan Placement](VRFTerminalUnit_wSuppHeatCoil.png)

Below is sample ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow object in EnergyPlus. This object will be modified to support supplemental heating coil.

Four new input fields: "Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type", "Supplemental Heating Coil Object Name", "Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater", and "Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation" will be added to the existing VRF air terminal unit object. Electric, Gas, hot water, and steam heating coils will be supported.  These four new input fields will be optional and are:

When there is remaining heating load not met by the DX heating coil of a VRF Air Terminal Unit, then the supplemental heating coil will run to meet the remaining heating load.

## Input Output Reference Documentation ##

Zone terminal units with variable refrigerant flow DX coils are used exclusively with variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioning systems (Ref. \hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} objects). The zone terminal units are connected to a zone using the inlet and exhaust node names specified in a \hyperref[zonehvacequipmentconnections]{ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} object. The zone exhaust node has the same name as the terminal unit air inlet node. The zone inlet node has the same name as the terminal unit air outlet node. The zone terminal unit is also listed in a zone's equipment list and will typically be the first equipment operating for both cooling and heating (i.e., Sequence = 1 in the \hyperref[zonehvacequipmentlist]{ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList}). Other ZoneHVAC equipment may be used in the same zone and should be sequenced to operate after the zone terminal units (i.e., sequence = 2 or higher)

The terminal units operate to satisfy a heating or cooling load in a zone based on a zone thermostat temperature set point. A direct-expansion (DX) cooling and/or DX heating coil is specified depending on the operating mode required. Both a DX cooling and DX heating coil will typically be installed in the terminal unit, however only one may be used if desired. An optional supplemental heating coil can be used to meet remaining heating load when the main DX heating coil cannot meet the entire heating load of a zone during cold outdoor conditions. Outdoor ventilation air is modeled with the use of an optional outside air mixer object. Outside air may be provided to the zone only when the coil is operating or can be supplied continuously even when the coil is not operating.

A supply air fan is also required and can be modeled as either draw through or blow through. The Supply Air Fan Object Type must be \hyperref[fansystemmodel]{Fan:SystemModel}, \hyperref[fanonoff]{Fan:OnOff}, or \hyperref[fanconstantvolume]{Fan:ConstantVolume} if \hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} is used to model the VRF outdoor unit. The Supply Air Fan Object Type must be \hyperref[fansystemmodel]{Fan:SystemModel} or \hyperref[fanvariablevolume]{Fan:VariableVolume} if AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:\-FluidTemperatureControl or AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:\-FluidTemperatureControl:HR is used to model the VRF outdoor unit.

The DX heating coil outlet node name will be the supplemental heating coil air inlet node name if the Supply Air Fan Placement is blow-through. If the Supply Air Fan Placement is draw-through, then the supply fan outlet node name will be the supplemental coil air inlet node name. The supplemental heating coil air outlet node name must be the zone air inlet node name if either the VRF terminal unit is not placed on air terminal mixer object, or the VRF terminal unit is placed on the inlet-side an air terminal mixer. If the VRF terminal unit is placed on supply side of an air terminal mixer, then the supplemental heating coil air outlet node name must be inlet node of the air terminal mixer.


### New Input Fields

#### Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type

This alpha field defines the type of supplemental heating coil to be used by this VRF terminal unit. The input requirements for these heating coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller or Controller:WaterCoil object. The parent object (VRF terminal unit) itself provides the “controller” function of modulating water flow. Allowable heating coil types are:

- Coil:Heating:Electric
- Coil:Heating:Fuel
- Coil:Heating:Water
- Coil:Heating:Steam

#### Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Name

This alpha field defines the name of the supplemental heating coil used by this VRF terminal unit, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding heating coil object. 

#### Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater

This numeric field defines the maximum supply air temperature in degrees Celsius leaving the VRF terminal unit supplemental heater coil. The supplemental heater will be controlled so that its supply air temperature does not exceed this value. This field is autosizable.

#### Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation

This numeric field defines the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature in degrees Celsius for this VRF terminal unit supplemental heater operation. The supplemental heater will not operate when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is above this value. The maximum value must be less than or equal to 21°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 21°C.
