Justification for Feature Update
================================

The proposed new feature improves the current HybridModel modeling
capability (Lee & Hong, 2017) by adding inverse modeling algorithms
based on the zone moisture and contaminant balance equations. The
current HybridModel feature uses measured zone air temperature to
inversely solve the zone internal thermal mass or air infiltration rate
assuming the HVAC system is off and zone is in free-floating mode. The
new HybridModel feature allows additional parameters such as the
measured zone air humidity ratio and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration as the input
to the inverse modeling algorithms to solve the highly uncertain
parameters such as air infiltration and people count. Depending on the
availability of the measured zone supply air parameters (i.e., supply
air flow rate, supply air temperature, supply air humidity ratio, and
supply air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration), the new HybridModel feature can solve
air infiltration and people count for both HVAC-off mode and HVAC-on
mode. The hybrid approach keeps the virtue of the physics-based model
and takes advantage of more measured buildings data which become
available nowadays due to the wide adoption of low-cost sensors and the
needs of better controls in existing buildings. This new feature
proposal provides technical details of the enhanced HybridModel object
and its implementation in EnergyPlus. The proposed feature will improve
simulation usability and accuracy for existing buildings, which supports
more accurate analysis of energy retrofits.

Overview
========

Air Infiltration
----------------

EnergyPlus uses the object, ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate, to
represent the infiltration caused by the opening and closing of exterior
doors, cracks around windows, and even in very small amount through
building elements. Users define the infiltration design air flow rate,
an infiltration schedule, and temperature and wind correction
coefficients. The source code module, ZoneEquipmentManager, contains the
simplified infiltration algorithm as shown in Equation (1).

Infiltration = (Idesign)(Fschedule)[A+B(T<sub>zone</sub>-T<sub>odb</sub>)+C(WindSpeed)+D(WindSpeed)<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; Eq. (1),

Where: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A is the Constant term coefficient <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B is the Temperature term coefficient <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C is the Velocity term coefficient <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D is the Velocity squared coefficient <br />

The simple method has an empirical correlation that modifies the
infiltration as a function of wind speed and temperature difference
across the envelope. The difficulty in using this equation is
determining valid coefficients for each building type in each location.
The simplified infiltration models consider the wind speed on zone
altitude, and the variation in infiltration heat loss based on the wind
velocity. These coefficients vary and provide very different results
that cause great uncertainty in determining which values to use.
EnergyPlus allows users to input these coefficients, however it is not
easy to identify correct ones for typical modeling practices. The
infiltration hybrid model derives the time-step zone infiltration air
flow rates, using the inverse zone heat balance equation, moisture
balance equation, or contaminant balance equation, which consider all
complexities of design flow rate, coefficients and climate conditions.

People Count
------------

In EnergyPlus, people count and people activity level is represented by
the People and corresponding Schedule objects. Users set the number of
people calculation method, people activity level, sensible and fraction
heat fractions, and CO<sub>2</sub> generation rate in the People object. Each
People object can be assigned to a zone or a zone list. A set of people
related schedule objects are used to define the temporal variation of
people count . In typical simulation setting, the People object is
usually set to have fixed schedules. In reality, occupancy schedule is
highly uncertain. Using the typical schedules for the People object can
lead to inaccurate results. The new hybrid model algorithm calculates
the time-step zone people count by inversely solving the zone sensible
heat balance equation, moisture balance equation, or contaminant balance
equation.

Zone Balance Equations
----------------------

The hybrid model algorithms are built upon the physics-based zone heat,
moisture, and contaminant balance equations reformulated to solve a
partially inverse problem. The basis for the zone air system integration
is to formulate balance equations for the zone air and solve the
resulting ordinary differential equations. It should be noted that the
hybrid algorithms to be developed are generic and can be adopted by
EnergyPlus and other building energy simulation programs. Equation (2)
below indicates zone heat balance relationships. It assumes that the sum
of zone loads and air system output equals the change in energy stored
in the zone. The infiltration airflow rate, m<sub>inf</sub>, changes for
different conditions depending on outdoor temperature, wind speed, and
HVAC system operations. The energy provided from systems to the zone is
represented as Q<sub>sys</sub>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ρ<sub>air</sub> is Zone air density ~ [kg/m^{3}], <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V<sub>z</sub> is Zone air volume ~ [m^{3}],<br />

The sum of zone loads and the provided air system energy equals the
change in energy stored in the zone. Typically, the capacitance
ρ<sub>air</sub>V<sub>z</sub> C<sub>p</sub> would be that of the zone air only. The internal
thermal masses, assumed to be in equilibrium with the zone air, are
included in this term. EnergyPlus provides algorithms to solve the zone
air energy and moisture balance equations defined in the
ZoneAirHeatBalanceAlgorithm object. The algorithms use the finite
difference approximation or analytical solution to calculate the
derivative term with respect to time.

EnergyPlus provides three different heat balance solution algorithms to
solve the zone air energy balance equations. These are defined in the
Algorithm field in the ZoneAirHeatBalanceAlgorithm object:
3rdOrderBackwardDifference, EulerMethod and AnalyticalSolution. The
first two methods to solve Equation use the finite difference
approximation while the third uses an analytical solution. The hybrid
modeling approach uses the 3rdOrderBackwardDifference to inversely solve
the air infiltration. EnergyPlus Code for these balance algorithms are
referenced to the ZoneTempPredictorCorrector module.

Similarly, EnergyPlus solves zone humidity ratio and CO<sub>2</sub>
concentration with the predictor-corrector approach. Equations (3) is
the zone air moisture balance equation.

Technical Approach
==================

This section provides technical details of solving zone balance
equations via third-order backward approximation. Depending on the
available number of zone air parameters (i.e., temperature, humidity
ratio, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration), there are different inverse solution
scenarios. The figure below shows the different inverse solution
scenarios. Theoritically, more than one un-known parameters (i.e., zone
thermal mass, air infiltration, and people count) could be solved at the
same time if the measurements of zone air temperature, humidity ratio,
and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration are all available. In this new feature, we only
propose the new algorithms to solve one unknown parameter at a time. The
solution scenario details are described in the following sub-sections.

Infiltration Inverse Models
---------------------------

This sub-section shows three scenarios to solve zone air infiltration
with different zone balance equations. Note that the system supply terms
may or may not be included depending on the HVAC system operation
status. The system supply terms should be included if the HybridModel is
used to solve air infiltration when the HVAC system is on. No system
supply term should be included if the HybridModel is used to solve air
infiltration when the HVAC system is off.

### Solving Infiltration with Temperature

Equation(2) can be re-written with the third-order backward
approximation:

People Count Inverse Models
---------------------------

This sub-section shows three scenarios to solve zone people count with
different zone balance equations. Note that the system supply terms may
or may not be included depending on the HVAC system operation status.
The system supply terms should be included if the HybridModel is used to
solve air infiltration when the HVAC system is on. No system supply term
should be included if the HybridModel is used to solve air infiltration
when the HVAC system is off.

Convergence
-----------

There can be many factors affecting the convergence when trying to solve
the differential equation numerically with the third-order backward
approximation. The most common issue is the overflow. For instance, the
indoor-outdoor air temperature difference term (T<sub>o</sub> - T<sub>z</sub>) can be a
very small number when the two temperatures are very close. Overflow
will happen if the program tries to calculate the air infiltration rate
by dividing the denominator of Equation (6) by C<sub>p</sub>(T<sub>o</sub> - T<sub>z</sub>).
Therefore, conditions checks are needed when implementing the algorithm
in the code. In this case, a threshold of 0.05°C or greater temperature
difference must be met to calculate the infiltration rate at one
timestamp. Similarly, thresholds are added for the algorithms using
humidity ratio and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. In addition, EnergyPlus uses a
zone predictor-corrector mechanism to calculate the heating or cooling
needs of a zone on HVAC system, and update the zone air parameters based
on the calculated amount of heating or cooling the HVAC system provides
to a zone. The uncertainties such as truncation errors in those
predictor-corrector routines can cause unrealistic in the inverse
modeling routine. Therefore, thresholds for infiltration and people
count calculation are applied to the code. For infiltration, a valid
value must be within the range of 0 to 10 air change per hour. For
people count, the lower bound is zero, and the upper-bound is the total
possible internal heat/moisture/CO<sub>2</sub> gain divided by the
heat/moisture/CO<sub>2</sub> generation rate.

Simulation Process
==================

The hybrid modeling feature uses a new flag, “Hybrid Modeling Flag” in
the sizing and primary simulation in the simulation manager. “Hybrid
Modeling Flag” is triggered by inputs in the new object,
“HybridModel:Zone”. The flag triggers the hybrid model simulation that
calculates the zone temperature capacitance multipliers, infiltration
air flow rates, or people count depending on the user’s input in the
object, and the zone air temperature data input in the Schedule:File
objects. The simulation steps will be as follows depending on the inputs
of the HybridModel:Zone object.

Solve Zone Air Infiltration
---------------------------

When the “Calculate Zone Air Infiltration Rate” flag is set to YES and
the “Calculate Zone People Count” flag is set to NO:

1.  One of the following schedules must be provided to trigger the
    inverse solution: (1) Zone Measured Air Temperature Schedule
    Name, (2) Zone Measured Air Humidity Ratio Schedule Name, (3) Zone
    Measured Air CO2 Concentration Schedule Name.

2.  One of the following schedule pairs can be supplemented to the
    corresponding zone measured air parameters above to trigger the
    inverse solution with system supply terms included: (1) Zone Supply
    Air Temperature Schedule Name, and Zone Supply Air Mass Flow Rate
    Schedule Name, (2) Zone Supply Air Humidity Ratio Schedule Name, and

    air infiltration with the system supply terms included in the zone
    sensible heat balance equation. Otherwise, the hybrid simulation

4.  If Zone Measured Air Humidity Ratio Schedule, Zone Supply Air
    Humidity Ratio Schedule, and Zone Supply Air Mass Flow Rate Schedule

    moisture balance equation. Otherwise, the hybrid simulation will

5.  If Zone Measured Air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration Schedule, Zone Supply Air

    infiltration with the system supply terms included in the zone
    CO<sub>2</sub> balance equation. Otherwise, the hybrid simulation will treat
    the system as free-floating if Zone Supply Air CO<sub>2</sub> Schedule, and

    Temperature Schedule, and Zone Supply Air Mass Flow Rate Schedule
    are all provided, the hybrid model simulation will solve the zone
    people count with the system supply terms included in the zone
    sensible heat balance equation. Otherwise, the hybrid simulation
    will treat the system as free-floating if Zone Supply Air
    Temperature Schedule, and Zone Supply Air Mass Flow Rate Schedule
    are not provided.

    treat the system as free-floating if Zone Supply Air Humidity Ratio
    Schedule, and Zone Supply Air Mass Flow Rate Schedule are not
    provided.
