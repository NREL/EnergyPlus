# NFP: HAMT Model Airflow Enhancements Part I #

## Justification for New Feature ##
The current HAMT model does not include air leakage in its calculation of the moisture deposition. Air movement as a moisture transport mechanism is typically far more important than vapor diffusion. Air leaks through walls, roofs, and floors can have the most damaging effect on the durability of a house. Uncontrolled airflow through the shell not only carries moisture into framing cavities, causing mold and rot, but it also can account for a huge portion of a home's energy use and can cause indoor air quality problems.

## Overview ##
The modification adds an internal moisture source in HAMT components due to air flow through the component. The moisture source is attached to a user-selected layer inside the component. Input options to determine the air flow are added, including a user-defined air flow, air flow determined from stack height, air permeance of the component and ventilation overpressure as well as are flow computed with the AirflowNetwork model.

These modifications to EnergyPlus are part of a larger effort to enhance the moisture transport capabilities of EnergyPlus. This NFP describes the first two steps of this process:

Step 1 - Enable air leakage to be applied as a source/sink at any arbitrary point inside the simulation model. Manual inputs of air flow rates is required.

Step 2 - Allow air leakage rates to be controlled by air pressure gradients induced by wind forces, temperature differences and ventilation system.

The necessary inputs will be developed to allow both user specified airflows and airflows calculated using the AirflowNetwork feature. The HAMT model calculations will be modified to account for this additional mode of transport.

## Approach ##
The HAMT model subdivides a wall into set of cells and computes the movement of moisture through the wall. Equation (3.36) in the Engineering Reference describes the calculation that is done. A source term that adds moisture to a specific cell is added to this equation of the form

```
S_i A_ij
```

where

```
S_i = m_dot(c_src - c_i_sat)
```

and

`m_dot` - air flow through the envelope per unit area (m^3/(m^2 h))

`c_src` - water vapor concentration in the source volume (kg/m^3)

`c_i_sat` - water vapor saturation concentration for cell `i` (kg/m^3)

## Engineering Reference ##
The HAMT section of the Engineering Reference will be modified to include and describe the new source term.

## I/O Reference ##
The I/O Reference will be modified to describe the additional moisture source inputs. A moisture source object
is attached to a particular layer in a manner similar to the way that heat sources are specified. The current proposal
suggests transitioning all `Construction:InternalSources` objects into regular construction objects. This does raise some
issues: (a) this approach isn't strictly a component model and (b) multiplicity of sources. However, this approach is
cleaner from a data model perspective in that it no longer requires a special construction to use these models.

`Construction:InternalSources` is removed and source information (both thermal and moisture) is moved out into separate objects.
