# NFP: New Contaminant Transport Feature #

## Justification for New Feature ##
The current contaminant transport feature lacks a number of features (e.g.
generalized sources and sinks, filtration and path removal) and is not tightly
enough integrated with AirflowNetwork to facilitate advanced calculations (e.g.
non-trace contaminant transport). The lack of filtration is particularly
limiting. Many species/materials of interest may be filtered (or removed with a
similar process), including particulate matter, CO2, and water vapor. Similarly,
the lack of more source and sink options tends to limit simulation to very
basic situations. In many cases (particularly for those with limited data on 
the details of the building), these limitations are not important because the
level of detail is simply not needed. For more advanced simulations,
particularly of innovative HVAC systems, this limitation bars use of EnergyPlus
for most users.

## Overview ##
The new feature will enable more advanced simulations of contaminant transport
with a procedure  that is tightly integrated with the AirflowNetwork (AFN)
feature of EnergyPlus. This restriction is required to guarantee conservation
of mass and avoid complications due to EnergyPlus's flexibiltiy (Lorenzetti and
Wray, 2013). Initially, a simple filter object will be made available and
connected to the AFN feature through modifications to the appropriate linkage
objects. Source and sink objects will be connected to the AFN feature through
modification of the AFN node object. While the eventual goal will be to
include simulation of non-trace species, the initial development will focus on
trace simulations for simplicity.

## Approach ##
For simulation of transport of trace contaminants, conservation of mass for a
transported material is written for each zone as:

```
dM/dt = sum(dot(M)_j) + G - R*M
```

where `M` is the mass of material in a zone, the `dot(M)_j`s are the fluxes of mass
of material into and out of the zone, `G` is the generation of material in the
zone, and `R` is the removal rate of material (by non-flux processes) from the
zone. Filtration processes are embedded in the `dot(M)_j`s and the equation is
typically writte in terms of zonal concentrations rather than mass. The resulting
equation is

```
dC/dt = sum(F_j*(1-n_j)C_j) + G - R*C = RHS
```

where `n_j` is the filtration efficiency along path `j`, the `F_j`s are the mass
flow of air along path `j`, and  `C_j` is the concentration at the upstream end
of the flow along the path. The right hand side terms are lumped together as
`RHS` for purposes of the explanations below. For trace contaminants, this
equation is coupled to the airflow calculation in one direction: the airflow
calculation determines the `F_j`s, but the transport of material has no impact
upon the airflows. 

To advance the conservation equations through time, there are a number of
different options. For now, the first order finite difference discretization in
time will be used in two different ways. First, the implicit Euler method will
be implemented as follows, with subscript indicating time:

```
M_(t+h) = M_t + h*RHS_(t+h)  
```

where `h` is the timestep. This method is implicit in that the right hand side
is evaluated at time `t+h`, which requires a solution of simultaneous equations. Fortunately,
the methods that are used to solve the airflow problem (e.g. the
skyline approach) may also be used here. The Crank-Nicolson method is an
alternative semi-implicit approach uses information from both `t` and `t+h`:

```
M_(t+h) = M_t + 0.5*h*(RHS_(t+h) + RHS_t)
```

This method also requires solution of simultaneous equations. In the future, an
explicit Euler method may be implemented as

```
M_(t+h) = M_t + h*RHS_(t)  
```

This approach was included in the original NFP, but due to the need for warnings and/or
guidance on the step size limitations of the explicit approach, implementation of this approach
is deferred for a later release. The main advantage of the explicit Euler approach is that it does
not require solution of simulataneous equations, and should a need arise for very small step sizes
the addition of this method will be reconsidered.

## Engineering Reference ##

## Output Details ##
TBD

## Example File and Transition Changes ##
An example file will be created that demonstrates the new feature.

## Discussion and Comments

* Inclusion of explicit solution method (Lixing Gu): The stability issue is hard to address with documentation and/or warnings,
so leaving this for a future release after the feature has gotten some use is a better path
* Filter as a full-fledged component with a flow model (Lixing Gu): This would simplify the implementation somewhat, but
would probably tightly link the flow model and material transport model too much. Considering options for renaming the additional
field in linkages.
* Ambient versus default concentration (Lixing Gu): Will rename the ambient concentration field to be default.
* Use of Material as name (Mike Witte): After further discussion, the terminology "AirflowNetwork Material" will be adopted for use in EnergyPlus
