## Justification for New Feature ##

Modern air-to-water heat pumps for commercial applications often include heat recovery for simultaneous heating and cooling. The air-to-water heat pump simulation in EnergyPlus was improved during the FY23 development cycle; however, the current model supports heat-only and cool-only modes of operation. EnergyPlus should be able to support heat recovery mode for the air-to-water heat pump simulations.

**- The new feature was requested by Design Builder **

## E-mail and  Conference Call Conclusions ##

* technicalities call, Feb 07, 2024 *

  Brent: you may run into supply side temperature control problem if you have lower setpoint temperature than the temperature limits (e.g., HW Recovery).

  Bereket: may be we should check the minimum of these temperatures. This will be investigated during implementation.
  
  Brent: are we going to use the same air source performance curves for heat recovery?

  Bereket: I have to think about it. Brent said he will check with Trane engineers for curves


## Overview ##

### Current Code ###

The existing Air-to-Water Heat Pump model supports heat-only and cool-only mode simulations. 

**- This enhancement allows simultaneous cooling and heating modes of operation for Air-to-Water Heat Pump model.

## Implementation Approach ##

*(1) This new feature can be implemented by modifying the following existing objects:

     Existing objects: `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Cooling` and `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating`


*(2) Adds six new input fields to support heat recovery operation mode for each HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:* object.

     Adds new heat recovery fluid inlet and outlet nodes: 
     New input fields `Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name` and `Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name` will be added to the `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Cooling` object.
	 New input fields `Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name` and `Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name` will be added to the `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating` object.
	 
     Adds heat recovery side reference water flow rate:
	 New input field `Heat Recovery Reference Flow Rate` will be added to the `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Cooling` and `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating` objects.      

	 Adds heat recovery fluid temperature limits:
     New input field `Maximum Heat Recovery Outlet Temperature` will be added to the `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Cooling` object.
	 New input field `Minimum Heat Recovery Outlet Temperature` will be added to the `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating` object.

     Adds heat recovery capacity and EIR modifier curves:
	 New input field `Heat Recovery Capacity Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name` will be added to the `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:*` objects.
	 New input field `Heat Recovery Electric Input to Output Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name` will be added to the `HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:*` objects.

		
*(3) Adds new code that supports calculating the heat rate and outlet node fluid temperature of the heat recovery system

	 Hot Water Recovery Rate Calculation:
	 {CAPFT_Val} = CAPFT(T_lSide_Cool, T_hrSide_Heat)
	 {Q_dot_{load,cool,avail}} = {Q_dot_{load,cool,ref}} * {CAPFT_Val}	 
	 {Q_dot_{HR,heat,avail}} = {Q_dot_{load,cool,avail}} + {Power_{cool}}
	 		
	 Heat Recovery Outlet Node Fluid Temperature Calculation:
	 {T_{HR,heat,out}} = {T_{HR,heat,in}} + {Q_dot_{HR,heat,avail}} / {{Cp_{heat}} * {m_dot_{HR,heat}}}

     Chilled Water Recovery Rate Calculation:
	 {CAPFT_Val} = CAPFT(T_lSide_Heat, T_hrSide_Cool) 
	 {Q_dot_{load,heat,avail}} = {Q_dot_{load,heat,ref}} * {CAPFT_Val} 
     {Q_dot_{HR,cool,avail}} = {Q_dot_{load,heat,avail}} - {Power_{heat}}

	 Heat Recovery Outlet Node Fluid Temperature Calculation:
	 {T_{HR,cool,out}} = {T_{HR,cool,in}} - {Q_dot_{HR,cool,avail}} / {{Cp_{cool}} * {m_dot_{HR,cool}}}

	 where,
	 CAPFT					 = capacity modifier normalized curve as a function of temperature
	 CAPFT_val				 = capacity modifier normalized curve value
	 {Q_dot_{load,heat,ref}} = heating coil reference capacity, W
	 {Q_dot_{load,cool,ref}} = cooling coil reference capacity, W
	 {Q_dot_{load,heat,avail}} = load side available heating rate, W
	 {Q_dot_{load,cool,avail}} = load side available cooling rate, W
	 {Q_dot_{HR,heat,avail}} = heat recovery available heating rate, W
	 {Q_dot_{HR,cool,avail}} = heat recovery available cooling rate, W
	 {T_{HR,heat,in}}		 = hot water heat recovery inlet node temperature, C
	 {T_{HR,heat,out}}		 = hot water heat recovery outlet node temperature, C
	 {{Cp_{heat}} 		 	 = hot water specific heat capacity, J/kgK
	 {m_dot_{HR,heat}}}		 = hot water heat recovery fluid mass flow rate, kg/s	 
	 {T_{HR,cool,in}}		 = chilled water heat recovery inlet node temperature, C
	 {T_{HR,cool,out}}		 = chilled water heat recovery outlet node temperature, C
	 {{Cp_{cool}} 		 	 = chilled water specific heat capacity, J/kgK
	 {m_dot_{HR,cool}}}		 = chilled water heat recovery fluid mass flow rate, kg/s
	 T_lSide_Cool			 = chiller load side entering fluid temperature, C 
	 T_hrSide_Heat		 	 = chiller heat recovery side entering fluid temperature, C
	 T_lSide_Heat			 = Heater load side entering fluid temperature, C 
	 T_hrSide_Cool			 = Heater heat recovery side entering fluid temperature, C

	 
*(4) Heat recovery operating mode simulation control.
      
	 ** the heat recovery mode operation is activated if heat recovery nodes are specified. **
	 
	 The heat recovery mode is essentially a passive operation. Hence, the HR delivered capacity is determined by the actual 
	 capacity of the chiller or heater operation.  Thus, the actual HR rate delivered can be estimated using the chiller or 
	 heater part-load ratio.
	 
	 Hot Water Heat Recovery:
	 {Q_dot_{HR,heat,actual}} = {PLR_{cool}} * {Q_dot_{load,cool,avail}} + {Power_{cool}}
	 
	 * the available capacity must be prorated by the chiller PLR to get the delivered hot water recovery rate. *

		 
	 Chilled Water Heat Recovery:
	 {Q_dot_{HR,cool,actual}} = {PLR_{heat}} * {Q_dot_{load,heat,avail}} - {Power_{heat}}
	 
     * the available capacity must be prorated by the heater PLR to get the delivered chilled water recovery rate. *
	 
	 ** required to check the user specified temperature limit at the heat recovery outlet node is not violated. ** 
	 * if the user specified temperature limit are exceeded then reset the heat recovery outlet temperature to the limit. *
	 * recalculate the heat recovery rate based on the temperature limit. *
	 * need to investigate how to represent the net balance between the available and actual heat recovery rate. *

	 where,
	 {Q_dot_{HR,heat,actual}} = heat recovery actual heating rate, W
	 {Q_dot_{HR,cool,actual}} = heat recovery actual cooling rate, W
	 {PLR_{cool}}		 	  = chiller part-load ratio, -
	 {PLR_{heat}}		 	  = heater part-load ratio, -
	 
*(5) Adds capacity and fluid flow rates sizing calculation for the heat recovery system.

	 Heat Recovery Reference Capacities Sizing: 
	 Hot Water Heating Reference Capacity:
	 {Q_dot_{HR,heat,ref}} = {Q_{ref,cool,coil}} * [1 + 1/{COP_cool}] 
 
	 Chilled Water Cooling Reference Capacity:
	 {Q_dot_{HR,cool,ref}} = {Q_{ref,heat,coil}} * [1 - 1/{COP_heat}]
	  
	 Heat Recovery Fluid Flow Rates Sizing:
	 Hot Water Recovery Design Flow Rate:
	 {m_dot_{HR,design,heat}} = {Sizing_Factor_{cool}} * {Q_dot_{HR,heat,ref}} / [{Cp_{heat}} * {DeltaT_{heat}}]
	 
	 Chilled Water Recovery Design Flow Rate:
	 {m_dot_{HR,design,cool}} = {Sizing_Factor_{heat}} * {Q_dot_{HR,cool,ref}} / [{Cp_{cool}} * {DeltaT_{cool}}]

	 where,
	 {Q_{ref,cool,coil}} 	= reference capacity of the chiller, W
	 {Q_{ref,heat,coil}} 	= reference capacity of the heater, W
	 {COP_cool})		 	= reference COP of the chiller, W/W
	 {COP_heat})		 	= reference COP of the heater, W/W
	 {Q_dot_{HR,heat,ref}}	= reference capacity of hot water heat recovery, W
	 {Q_dot_{HR,cool,ref}}	= reference capacity of chilled water heat recovery, W
	 {DeltaT_{heat}}  	 	= hot water loop design temperature difference, K
	 {DeltaT_{cool}}  	 	= chilled water loop design temperature difference, K
	 {Sizing_Factor_{cool}} = sizing factor of the chiller, (-)
	 {Sizing_Factor_{heat}} = sizing factor of the heater (heat pump), (-)
