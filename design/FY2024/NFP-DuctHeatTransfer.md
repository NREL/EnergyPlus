## Justification for New Feature ##

EnergyPlus is being used by many tools around the world, and used as the calculation basis for hundreds of thousands of residential homes leading to billions of dollars of federal energy efficiency rebates in coming years. One aspect that potentially holds back the impact of these studies is related to duct simulation in EnergyPlus. There is skepticism about the accuracy of the model when we cannot simulate certain duct physics in a simplified manner. Although the airflow network model can handle ducts well, we need a duct model that captures duct heat transfer without having to build out a full airflow network.

## E-mail and Conference Call Conclusions ##

### Conference call with NREL residential group ###

The conference call with NREL residential group was held on 1/4/24. Attendees are Edwin Lee, Scott Horowitz, Jon Winkler, and Lixing Gu.

Before the conference call, Lixing Gu sent the FSEC original NFP to Scott. The original NFP presents how FSEC wanted to accomplish the new feature. Scott also sent NREL E+ Duct Model document to Lixing Gu. The NREL document presents a big wish list from NREL point of view.

The conference call discussed both documents. Herer are discussion topics based on the NREL document and associated agreements and differences.

#### Requirements ####

The NFP allows multiple supply and return ducts using exisitng E+ configuration of Splitters and Mixers. Both parties agree to use FSEC proposed confiuration as a starting point.

#### Inputs ####

Both parties agree the proposed new duct object. NREL wants to cove duct leakage. FSEC agrees that the duct leakage is important to the duct model. However, based on current scope and budget, the duct leakage will be developed in later phases.

The conference call also discussed inputs of effective R-value of duct. FSEC thinks the effective R-value should be user input. Duct shape is also dicussed. Hydronic diameter input is required. The user are required to convert any shapes into hydronic diameter as pre-processing.

#### Modeling algorithm ####

Both parties agree to use the exisitng algorithm to handle duct steady state heat transfer based on 13.1.4 Node Temperature Calculations in the Energuneering Reference.

No leakage will be included in the present new feature.

#### Testing/validation ####

FSEC will validate the model compared to Excel calculation results. NREL will compare model results with EMS  implementations.

#### Other ####

NREL request relationship to ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit ("Simplified Duct Leakage Model").

The paragraph is extracted from Input Output Reference:

The Air Distribution unit also allows the user to specify leaks in the supply air duct system. These inputs are used in the EnergyPlus Simplified Duct Leakage Model (SDLM). This model simulates a specific configuration: supply leaks to a return plenum in a commercial VAV or CV system.

Since the proposed new feature does not deal with duct leakage, there is no relationship.

Unfortunately, no discription of Simplified Duct Leakage Model is found in the Input Output Reference.

NREL also mentions CSE duct model.

The CSE duct model is available in the link at https://www.energycodeace.com/site/custom/public/reference-ace-2019/index.html#!Documents/110ductsystemmodel.htm

Here is model simple description extracted from the link:

The duct model builds on the procedure given by Palmiter (see Francisco and Palmiter, 2003), that uses a steady state heat exchanger effectiveness approach to get analytical expressions for instantaneous duct loss and system efficiencies. The duct model, developed for this program by Palmiter, makes use of many of the same fundamental steady state equations and approach, but given the considerable complexity of the multiple duct systems, does not do a simultaneous solution of all the equations which a generalized Francisco and Palmiter scheme may imply.  Instead the approach takes advantage of the small time steps used in the code, and in effect decouples the systems from each other and the zone by basing all losses and other heat transfers occurring during the time step on the driving conditions of Tair and Tmrt known at the beginning of the time step, similar to how heat transfers are determined during mass temperature updates.

Other assumptions made in the duct program: mass and thermal siphon effects in the duct system are ignored.

The duct system performance is analyzed at every time step. The duct air temperatures are calculated assuming they are operating at steady state, in equilibrium with the thermal conditions at the beginning of the time-step in the attic. Heat capacity effects of the ducts are ignored.

The model simplifies the heat transfer calculation with the multiple duct system. Since the new feature calculates heat transfer one by one, the proposed new feature can provide more accurated duct losses without any simplifications.

### Follow-up E-mail communication after NREL conference call ###

Thu 1/4/2024 5:05 PM

Thanks! A couple comments:

•	"NREL will compare model results with EMS and AFN implementations." -- Please remove the AFN part. I don't think we will be able to do that as we are not set up to easily create models w/ AFN.

•	"FSEC thinks the effective R-value should be user input." – You are referring to the effective R-value excluding interior/exterior air films, right? To be clear, I was originally thinking that E+ might ask for the effective R-value including interior/exterior air films, since they may be prescribed by a standard. E.g., the ANSI/RESNET standard currently says to model uninsulated ducts using an effective R-1.5. Perhaps that could be a separate input for air film or convection coefficient, or there could be some way to connect the SurfaceProperty:ConvectionCoefficients object to these duct objects.

•	"Duct shape is also dicussed. Hydronic diameter input is required. The user are required to convert any shapes into hydronic diameter as pre-processing." – Agreed. But an equally important consideration for duct shape is that the nominal insulation R-Value is derated relative to a rectangular duct. That effect can presumably be accounted for in the duct construction materials (effective R-value), though a typical user may not realize they should do this.

Also, I found another description of how ducts are modeled for California here. It may not have any new/different information than what you already saw.

### EnergyPlus Technicalities on 1/10/24 ###

The NFP was discussed in the EnergyPlus Technicalities call.

#### Comments ####
Jason DeGraw:

He has different opinion to allow a simple model, since the AFN is able to have a full duct model. He prefers to have compatable approach.

Gu: 

The proposed new object mimics AFN duct model with heat transfer only. The same conduction loss model is used. The model is mainly used by NREL residential group to simplify inputs without using the AFN model.

Jason Glazer:

Since AFN model has all input, is it possible to have a high level object to refer existing AFN object?

Gu:

The proposed object is a simplified object to have more restrictions compared to the full AFN model. It is hard to have a high level object. It addition, the high level object may confuse users.

Rich Raustad:

Suggest to use Inlet and Outlet node connection for the new object.

Gu:

Accept. 

Actions:

1. Use node to replace inlet and outlet name to have a clear picture for node connection
2. Simplify inputs for exterior film coefficients to mimic inputs of AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Duct
 

## Overview ##

The objective is to design and implement the code changes required to support a new duct model, or modifications to an existing duct model, that enable duct heat transfer to be captured without requiring an airflow network to be set up. We will discuss with NREL’s residential group for guidance on implementation requirements and ensure that the implementation will directly address the skepticism around this capability to ensure EnergyPlus can be used confidently in residential building studies.

###Assumptions###

1. The proposed duct model deals with heat transfer only. In other words, no duct air leakage will be modeled.

2. There are 4 duct types to be simulated: SupplyTrunk, SupplyBranch, ReturnTrunk, and ReturnBranch.

3. There is a single duct used for SupplyTrunk and ReturnTrunk. 

The connection of SupplyTrunk is between the inlet node (AirloopHVAC Demand Side Inlet Node) of AirLoopHVAC and the AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter inlet node. If AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer is available, The connection of ReturnTrunk is between AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer outlet node and the outlet node (AirloopHVAC Demand Side Outlet Node) of AirLoopHVAC. 

4. Each branch has a single duct.

The connection of SupplyBranch is between AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter outlet node and one of the Air terminal inlet node. If AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer is available, The connection of ReturnBranch is between the zone outlet node and the AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer inlet node.

5. Inlet node temperature, humidity, and mass flow rate are known

6. No return ducts when AirloopHVAC:ZoneReturnPlenum is used

The following figure shows proposed duct configurration.

![Figure 1 Schematic for ducts](Schametic.PNG)

Figure 1. Schematic for proposed ducts with blue arrow object. The arrows show flow directions.

###Model###

There are 2 approaches to simulate duct heat transfer with conduction losses. The outcome is to provide duct outlet node temperature and humidity ratio.

####Steady state with convection only as Phase 1####

The outlet node temperature will be calculated based on 13.1.4 Node Temperature Calculations in the Energuneering Reference.

The outlet node humidity ratio will be calculated based on 13.1.5 Node Humidity Ratio Calculations in the Energuneering Reference.

####Steady state with both convection and radiation as Phase 2####

Duct radiation will be added based on Phase 1 using the method decribed in 13.1.4.2 Duct Radiation in the Energuneering Reference. 

The radiation exchange has low priority from NREL point of view. FSEC agrees.

####Dynamic losses with thermal mass Phase 3####

Removed

###Possible accomplishment###

Due to time and budget limit, we will lay down foundation of structure for duct inputs and guarantee to deliver duct loss calculation using Steadystate method. The SteadystateWithRadiation method is in the plan and may not be  delivered.  

## Approach ##

A new object simular to Pipe:Indoor is proposed. The main differences are that Fluid Inlet Node Name and Fluid Outlet Node Name are replaced by Inlet Node Name and Outlet Node Name. See detailed description in the Section of Input Description.

In order to make the proposed object compatible with existing
