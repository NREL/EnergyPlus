# Justification for New Feature 

Building energy modeling for LEED certification requires to disable self-shading effect in the baseline model, which gives credit to the proposed building with self-shading. For example, an L-shape building that is oriented correctly can provide significant self-shading and ASHRAE Standard 90.1 wants to reward that design choice. The proposed new feature will allow users to disable self-shading effect in EnergyPlus.

# Team Discussion

Some feedback from Mike Witte and Jason Glazer.

# Overview 

Currently in EnergyPlus, if the Solar Distribution is not set to MinimalShadowing, shading from detached shading, wings, overhangs, and exterior surfaces of all zones are computed. To disable self-shading effect, we would bypass the shading by exterior surfaces of all zones, which are by default created in EnergyPlus: one shading surface for each exterior surface of all zones. This is straightforward, except when a single IDF file contains two or more detached buildings (which cannot be detected by EnergyPlus). In this case, the shading of one buildingâ€™s exterior surfaces on other buildings should be counted even when self-shading is disabled. 

# Approaches 

We propose to add a fields to the ShadowCalculation object to disable self-shading effect from exterior surfaces from all zones, or from a subset of zones. To address the cases with multiple buildings in a single EnergyPlus model (IDF file), two flags are defined to enable the maximal flexibility of various interpretation of self-shading: one to disable shading between zones of a same zone group, the other to disable shading between different zone groups.
