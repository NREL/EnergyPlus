## Justification for Feature Update ##
Many inpatient and outpatient healthcare facilities in the US and around the world are governed by ASHRAE Standard 170 or similar standards that require minimum supply air flow rates during occupied mode operation by space type. In order to maintain thermal comfort, this minimum air flow rate may be exceeded and in perimeter spaces the design air flow can be twice as high the design minimum air flow. But during unoccupied mode operation, the minimum air flow based on space type can be either zero, the box minimum, or the minimum required to maintain air flow direction between spaces.

Although EnergyPlus supports minimum airflow schedule, this schedule applies to the calculated peak airflow in the zone. Users are currently unable to model the appropriate minimum airflow turndowns. 

Adding a “Minimum Flow Schedule” that applies to the design minimum air flow, will allow users the flexibility to better model actual building operation.

@mjwitte, Comment:
"Operating" is a bit confusing here. Even though the other inputs are the "design" minimum, they also are used for operation, and the existing "Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name" is primarily operational. It's only used for sizing if the other min flow fields are blank. How about "Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name" or "Minimum Air Flow Adjustment Schedule Name" or ???

Is this adjustment limited to zero to 1.0? Or would an adjustment >1.0 ever be applicable?

@Nigusse, Response:
I will use "Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name" as the new field name but will use "Adjustment" in the description. I am thinking to limit to 0.0 to 1.0. I think users should use the design minimum fraction or the design minimum flow if they desire scale it up.


@mjwitte, Comment:
Feel free to rename this confusing struct SysDesignParams and its associated name Sys.

@Nigusse, Response:
I will take the liberty to rename the struct when I get there. Thanks.

@mjwitte, Comment:
Same here, I've always found DamperDesignParams and Damper to be confusing.

@Nigusse, Response:
will do.

@mjwitte, Comment:
My initial thought is to apply it. The user can always set this to 1.0 for the Winter and Summer design day types. But this needs to be explained clearly that it will get used. But I'd be ok with not applying it. I guess it depends on the details of how this should be used relative to the referenced Standards.

I agree, applying it gives users the flexibility. If they choose not to do, they have the option to specify different schedule values for Winter and Summer design days. I will add note in the I/O Ref documentation and even in the idd if necessary.


## Overview ##

All the six VAV air terminal units in EnergyPlus has input for specifying a constant minimum air flow fraction. This fraction is defined relative to the air terminal maximum air flow and used to determine the *design minimum* supply air flow. However, the "AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat" and "AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat" have two more method of specifying the minimum flow input methods (1) *Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate*, and (2) *Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name*.

The *Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate* input method allows to enter a fixed minimum flow rate, and the *Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name* input method allows to enter a scheduled minimum air flow fractions. This existing minimum flow fraction applies the peak design flow rate only. The following two VAV air terminal objects have three different input methods for specifying the design minimum air flow: 

 - **AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat**
 - **AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat**

The following four VAV air terminal object types have only one input method for specifying the minimum air flow and that is *Zone Minimum Air Flow Fraction* input method and this fraction is defined relative to the air terminal maximum (peak) air flow.

 - **AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat:VariableSpeedFan**
 - **AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat**
 - **AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat**
 - **AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV**

The **AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat:VariableSpeedFan** object minimum air flow is used when there is no load (or when the air terminal VAV fan is off). The use of the minimum air flow for this air terminal object is slightly different.

## Approach ##

The approach this enhancement implementation is to add a new input field that operates on the design minimum air flow. The value of this schedule multiplies the design minimum air flow. This enhancement gives users the flexibility to adjust the box design minimum air flow for the different building application needs.

### New Input Field ###
"Operating Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name"



### Pseudocode ###


#### Calculating of Operating (actual) Minimum Air Flow at the Air Terminal Box ####

Currently the design minimum air flow is determined from user specified minimum air flow fraction and the maximum (peak) air flow as follows:

***DesignMinimumFlowRate*** is the design minimum air flow determined based one of the three methods currently supported.

***DesignMinimumFlowRate = Sys.AirMassFlowRateMax * Sys.ZoneMinAirFrac***

This enhancement will allow adjusting the design minimum air flow to determine minimum air flow turndown using the fraction values specified in the new input field (Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name) as follows:
 
***MinimumTurnDownFlowRate = DesignMinimumFlowRate * TurnDownMinimumFraction***

or

***OperatingMinimumFlowRate = Sys.AirMassFlowRateMax * Sys.ZoneMinAirFrac * TurnDownMinimumFraction***

***TurnDownMinimumFraction*** is defined as the ratio of *Minimum TurnDown AirFlow* to the *Design Minimum AirFlow*. The *Minimum Air Flow Turndown Fraction*, which is obtained from the new input field and multiplies the design minimum air flow to calculate minimum turndown air flow.

If there is outdoor air flow required for ventilation, then the actual minimum will be the maximum of the minimum turndown air flow calculated above and the current outdoor air flow requirement as shown below:

***MinimumTurnDownFlowRate = max(MinimumTurnDownFlowRate, CurrentOAMassFlowRate)***


And this operating minimum air flow is checked against the minimum and maximum air flow of the air terminal boxes set during initialization at every iteration as shown below:

***MinimumTurnDownFlowRate = max(MinimumTurnDownFlowRate, SysInlet.AirMassFlowRateMinAvail)***

***MinimumTurnDownFlowRate = min(MinimumTurnDownFlowRate, SysInlet.AirMassFlowRateMaxAvail)***


The system inlet minimum available air flow rate will be the operating minimum and is calculated as follows:

***SysInlet.AirMassFlowRateMinAvail = Sys.AirMassFlowRateMax * Sys.ZoneMinAirFrac * TurnDownMinimumFraction***


The maximum air flow during reheat will not be adjusted by the new field, will remain the design minimum and is given by:

***MaxAirVolFlowRateDuringReheat = Sys.MaxAirVolFlowRate * Sys.ZoneMinAirFrac***

If the new input field is blank, then the **TurnDownMinimumFraction** variable will be set to 1.0.


##Testing/Validation/Data Source(s):
The new feature will be compared against exiting model. Unit test will be performed to ensure report variables values are correct. Also a new example file will be provided as needed. 


##IO Ref (draft):

The new input field will be appended to the end of the existing air terminal VAV objects. Modified *AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat* object is shown below as a sample.

The input field *Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name* fraction values (0.0 to 1.0) will be used to adjust the design minimum air flow turndowns (for example during unoccupied hours) by multiplying the design minimum air flow. These fractions also adjust the design minim air flow used for sizing purpose but users may choose not to so by specifying a fraction value of 1.0 for Summer and Winter Design Days. This field can be used with any of the three *zone minimum air flow input methods*.

Existing function GetSysInput() will be modified to get the new input field value for single duct VAV system.  A new member variable will be read and set user specified value.

Existing function InitSys() will be modified to calculate and set the operating minimum air flow rate using the new schedule fraction value.

The minimum operating air flow available will be determined as follows:
 
**Node(InletNode).MassFlowRateMinAvail = Sys.AirMassFlowRateMax * Sys.ZoneMinAirFrac * Sys.ZoneOperatingMinAirFrac**

Existing functions for simulating the various VAV air terminal units (such as SimVAV, SimVAVVS, SimCBVAV, SizeSys....) will be modified to apply the operating minimum air flow fraction as needed.

  Modify struct "DamperDesignParams"  to add new new member variable
  
    struct DamperDesignParams
    {
        // Members
        std::string DamperName; // Name of the Damper
        //  CHARACTER(len=MaxNameLength) :: DamperType  = ' ' ! Type of Damper ie. VAV, Mixing, Inducing, etc.
        int DamperType;            // Type of Damper ie. VAV, Mixing, Inducing, etc.
        std::string Schedule;      // Damper Operation Schedule
        int SchedPtr;              // Pointer to the correct schedule

        ...

        // add two new member variables
        int ZoneOperatingMinAirFracSchPtr;    // pointer to the schedule for operating minimum airflow fraction
        Real64 ZoneOperatingMinAirFrac;       // operating minimum airflow fraction value, multiplier of zone design minimum airflow 

        // Default Constructor
        DamperDesignParams()
            : DamperType(0), SchedPtr(0), MaxAirVolFlowRate(0.0), MaxAirMassFlowRate(0.0), HotAirInletNodeNum(0), ColdAirInletNodeNum(0),
              OutletNodeNum(0), ZoneMinAirFrac(0.0), ColdAirDamperPosition(0.0), HotAirDamperPosition(0.0), OAInletNodeNum(0),
              RecircAirInletNodeNum(0), RecircIsUsed(true), DesignOAFlowRate(0.0), DesignRecircFlowRate(0.0), OAControlMode(0),
              RecircAirDamperPosition(0.0), OADamperPosition(0.0), OAFraction(0.0), ADUNum(0), CtrlZoneNum(0), CtrlZoneInNodeIndex(0),
              ActualZoneNum(0), OutdoorAirFlowRate(0.0), NoOAFlowInputFromUser(true), OARequirementsPtr(0), OAPerPersonMode(PerPersonModeNotSet),
              OAPerPersonByDesignLevel(0.0), AirLoopNum(0), 
              
              ZoneOperatingMinAirFracSchPtr(0), ZoneOperatingMinAirFrac(0.0)
   
          {
        }
    }

Existing function GetDualDuctInput() will be modified to get the new input field value for dual duct VAV system.  A new member variable will be read and set user specified value.

Existing function InitDualDuct() will be modified to calculate and set the damper operating minimum air flow rate using the new schedule fraction value.

The hot and cold deck minimum operating air flow available will be determined as follows:

**Node(OutletNode).MassFlowRateMin = Node(OutletNode).MassFlowRateMax * Damper.ZoneMinAirFrac * Damper.ZoneOperatingMinAirFrac**

**Node(HotInNode).MassFlowRateMinAvail = DamperHotAirInlet.AirMassFlowRateMax * Damper.ZoneMinAirFrac * Damper.ZoneOperatingMinAirFrac**

**Node(ColdInNode).MassFlowRateMinAvail = DamperColdAirInlet.AirMassFlowRateMax * Damper.ZoneMinAirFrac * Damper.ZoneOperatingMinAirFrac**

Existing function SimDualDuctVarVol() will be modified to calculate and set the damper operating minimum air flow rate.
  

### Sizing Issue

One obvious technical issue that needs to be discussed is that do we want to change the minimum air flow used for sizing the child objects in the air terminal objects. For example, should we size the reheat coil using the design minim air flow, or should we use the adjusted minimum air flow?

Based on github comments from @mjwitte, the fraction values from the new input field "Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name" will multiply the design minimum air flow used for sizing purposes and users will have the option to not to do so by appropriately scheduling a value of 1.0 for Winter and Summer Design Days.
