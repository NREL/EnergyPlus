## Justification for Feature Update

The push for higher HVAC system efficiency and decarbonization has led to HVAC systems with new designs for hot and cold water plants that use heat pumps to serve both plants. Manufacturers, building owners and operators, and design professionals request improved tools to model these advanced plant configurations for todays HVAC systems.

From a historical perspective, chilled water plants have traditionally used thermal storage to minimize building peak demand to help utility companies delay construction of new power plants. Current trends are now using thermal storage as a pathway for heat recovery and improved HVAC system plant efficiency. A water plant utilizing heat pumps could make ice during early morning or late evening hours when heating is required and burn that ice during the day to offset cooling loads. These plants would use high efficiency heat pumps and optimized plant configurations that cannot be modeled in current building simulation software tools. A plant design such as this would also require advanced controls to dispatch heat recovery heat pumps, multiple chiller heaters serving the hot and cold water loops, and determine times for ice thermal storage production.

This proposal outlines a new feature for a plant supervisory controller and an expansion of the existing HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Cooling and HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating objects to include typical equipment operating features and limitations. The supervisory controller will build on the existing plant control techniques by adding a new object to manage control of the hot and cold water plants and the equipment serving those plants as *PlantEquipmentOperation:ChillerHeaterChangeover*. The existing HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR objects will be improved to include new features, for example defrost controls, operating temperature limits, and allow controls to meet either a plant load or a chiller heater leaving water set point.

The proposed approach would be to develop the new supervisory controller and add new functionality to the existing chiller heaters such that a plant of this type could be modeled. Added controls and alternate plant designs could be added in the future. 

## Overview ##

HVAC system water plant equipment would typically include a chiller and boiler. Newer plants use heat pumps with diverting values such that one or more chiller heaters could serve either plant (return side diverting valves not shown in figure). This plant configuration would mix plant fluids from both loops. A discussion of whether to model diverting valves or rely on the traditional EnergyPlus plant loop topology resulted in the selection of the current plant topology.

In EnergyPlus, water plant operation will be coordinated using the supervisory control manager. This manager will identify building HVAC loads and dispatch plant equipment by choosing which plant component to operate at any given time using, tentatively, the plant RunFlag variable. The left side of Figure 1 shows a traditional plant with 2 heat pumps. Either heat pump can serve either plant loop using diverting valves. This concept can be modeled in EnergyPlus using a pair of HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR objects, where only 1 of the pair can be active at any given time. A PlantEquipmentOperation:ChillerHeaterChangeover object will monitor building loads and manage plant operation. The figure also includes as an example optional equipment for an auxiliary boiler, in case the chiller heater temperature limits may limit operation, and thermal storage, for heat recovery or traditional use, and various chiller heater configurations. The heat pumps could be configured as 2-pipe air-cooled, 4-pipe water-cooled, or 6-pipe heat recovery. This new feature intends to build the basic components required to operate these advanced plant configurations.

Notes on this figure:
 - An ideal HX may be required to connect a heat recovery heat pump between plant loops because EnergyPlus allows only a single mixer/splitter per loop. The ideal HX won't have losses. An alternative is to place this HR HP on the plant inlet or outlet branch where no HX is required.
 - Mixing of plant fluids is not part of this feature, which is likely not an issue other than checking plant loop fluid properties and providing warnings.
 - Optional equipment shown will operate under independent controls without supervisory control until such time that additional controls can be added to the supervisor.
 - The 4-pipe heat recovery heat pump might be placed on the supply or demand side of the plant loop to allow for both constant and variable speed pump configurations.
 - Plant loop temperature fluctuations due to defrost are not explicitly modeled at this time (i.e., the defrost shock tank would absorb the majority of this temperature swing, but actual plant temperature changes are not modeled.
 - Thermal ice storage dispatch is not yet included as part of this feature.

## Approach

This new feature will include a new object **PlantEquipmentOperation:ChillerHeaterChangeover** and also include updates to the 2-pipe and 4-pipe version of a chiller heater using the existing objects *HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Cooling* and *HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating*. This new feature will not include advanced controls for the ice storage system or auxiliary boiler discussed here. Additional equipment controls for the boiler and ice tank, if needed, may be added at a future time.

Trane has provided normalized capacity and power performance curves for heat pump equipment that would be (and currently are field deployed) used in this type of plant. The power curve was converted to energy input ratio to be consistent with existing models in EnergyPlus. Trane also provide a new defrost model as an alternative to those used for DX heating coils. All 3 defrost models will be included in the modifications to the HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating object.

Trane has also identified minimum and maximum operating temperature limits which are included to more accurately model this equipment type.

The advanced operation of the chilled and hot water plants will be managed by the supervisory control manager. Zones attached to these plants will be polled for loads and summed to represent each plant load. The chiller heaters will be dispatched as either cooling only, heating only, or simultaneous cooling and heating. Controls to dispatch a heat pump heat recovery unit are being investigated (center right of figure).


## Testing/Validation/Data Source(s)

This new feature/enhancement will be tested and demonstrated with a new test file that  includes the supervisory control manager using the new PlantEquipmentOperations object and expanded versions of the existing chiller heater objects.

The new object used as a supervisory controller is shown here. The most notable input is the Zone Load Polling ZoneList Name input. A list of zone names associated with this plant loop pair is used to identify plant loads based on "polled" building zone loads and anticipated outdoor air loads. This method is chosen as an alternate to looking at actual plant loads, which can be hard to identify with complex plant topology. Regardless of the method, plant manager dispatch logic will determine which plant loop is active and which plant equipment will serve those loads.

## Code Design Documentation

The HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR object changes are fairly straight-forward. New class variables are added to represent each new input field. A code example for the new Control Type input field with a \default value = Load. Note here that the default value is not checked and assumed to be Load. The default field value will be further discussed in the next example.

    constexpr std::array<std::string_view, 
            static_cast<int>(ControlType::Num)> PLHPCtrlTypeNamesUC = {"SETPOINT", "LOAD"};
    auto const controlType = fields.find("control_type");
    if (controlType != fields.end()) {
        thisPLHP.sysControlType = static_cast<ControlType>(
                    getEnumerationValue(PLHPCtrlTypeNamesUC,
                    UtilityRoutines::MakeUPPERCase(controlType.value().get<std::string>())));
    } else { // default to Load as specified in idd, without checking for default?
        thisPLHP.sysControlType = ControlType::Load;
    }

As another example of getInput where an input field has a default specified, the Minimum Part Load Ratio field has a default of 0. The class variable representing this field will also be initialized to 0. If the default value was removed from this idd input field, the entire else section of this getInput could be removed and the result of a blank field would still be 0 without the need for the extra checking. This of course does not allow the user to change the default value in the json idd, but the user can always enter a value. Using this same methodology, the default value could be removed from the Control Type field example above. Documentation could describe that blank fields default to Load and 0, respectively.

The suggestion here is to remove defaults for specific inputs without a required-field tag and instead use the method described above and document the default action (e.g., the IORef says the field above defaults to Load if left blank). If the user wants a different result, the field can be filled in with that intent. Applies to non-required key choices and numeric inputs.

    auto const minPLR = fields.find("minimum_part_load_ratio");
    if (minPLR != fields.end()) {
        thisPLHP.minimumPLR = minPLR.value().get<Real64>();
    } else { // get default value
        Real64 defaultVal = 0.0;
        bool defaultFound = state.dataInputProcessing->inputProcessor->getDefaultValue(
            state, cCurrentModuleObject, "minimum_part_load_ratio", defaultVal);
        if (!defaultFound) {
            // excluding from coverage
            ShowWarningError(state, // LCOV_EXCL_LINE
                 format("EIR PLHP \"{}\": Heat Pump Minimum Part Load Ratio not entered and default value not found.",
                                    thisPLHP.name)); // LCOV_EXCL_LINE
                 errorsFound = true;                 // LCOV_EXCL_LINE
        } else {
            thisPLHP.minimumPLR = defaultVal;
        }
    }

## Water Plant Supervisory Control

The larger effort of this new feature is to develop a plant supervisory controller that determines building loads and dispatches equipment according to the user specified plant equipment operation schemes.

A typical plant supervisory control system will include the existing plant equipment operation scheme objects.

The final 3 inputs of this new object holds the name of the chiller heater used for heat recovery between plant loops and a load factor where the heat recovery chiller heater is allowed to operate. The intention of this model is that the heat recovery chiller heater will meet low loads on one of the plants. When any primary equipment on that plant are active the heat recovery chiller heater is off. The use of a heat recovery heat pump is anticipated to be included with this new feature development effort.

The supervisory class will reside in the unused source file EquipAndOperations.cc. The pointer to ChillerHeaterSupervisoryOperation will be added to state.

## Chiller Heater Heat Pump Performance

A Trane systems development engineering document dated March 10, 2022 included several performance aspects of a chiller heater product. This internal document contained:

 - Cooling and heating capacity curves and IP performance curve coefficients
 - Cooling and heating power curves and IP performance curve coefficients
 - A graph of minimum and maximum hot water temperature versus outdoor temperature with associated IP performance curve coefficients
 - A detailed defrost model with associated IP performance curve coefficients
 - A heating capacity adjustment model for latent loading on the condenser fins
 - Cooling and heating part-load ratio curves with associated IP performance curve coefficients

 This document was reviewed and enhancements/additions to the HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR model were designed and implemented. Control sequences formed the basis for the supervisory control implementation.
