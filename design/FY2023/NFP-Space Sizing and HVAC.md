## Justification for New Feature ##

Space was added as a new concept in v9.6. Each EnergyPlus Zone contains one or more Spaces which are used for:

  * assigning and allocating internal gains
  * specifying enclosure boundaries,
  * reporting inputs grouped by space types, and 
  * reporting select output grouped by space types.
  
For the zone heat balance each thermal Zone is composed of one or more Spaces controlled by a single thermostat or HVAC system control point such as a VAV terminal unit.

In version 23.1 options were added to perform the air heat balance for each Space or each Zone, and space-level heat balance output variables were added.

This NFP proposes additional optional capabilities:

  * Space-level (room-by-room) sizing to size individual room diffusers or equipment such as PTACs. 
  
  * Zone-level equipment may be sized to either the coincident or non-coincident peak across the Spaces (rooms). 

  * Space-by-space HVAC simulation to allow modeling the impact of thermostat placement in a specific space (room). This may result in less-than-ideal temperature control for other spaces in the same Zone. For some applications, such as a unitary system with a single thermostat, this can already be modeled with the "control zone" options. This feature would extend to other system types, including VAV systems or unitary systems with zoning controls.

## E-mail and Conference Call Conclusions ##

Lots of useful comments and input from Rich R.

Other conf call and email comments/questions:

Q1: What about return air nodes from spaces?

A1: The hope is that return air can be collected at the zone level, but implementation may require adding space return nodes.

Q2: These Setpoint Not Met Time output variables seem important. Seems like a clear method for how the space level results get rolled up to the zone level will be needed, eg. average temperature for zone first and then compare to setpoint, or is zone unmet if any spaces are unmet.

A2: Agreed, initial thought is that space hours not met will be reported separately, and zone hours not met would be based on the zone thermostat location.



## Overview ##

The `ZoneAirHeatBalanceAlgorithm` object has options for space heat balance.
```
ZoneAirHeatBalanceAlgorithm,
    ThirdOrderBackwardDifference,  !- Algorithm
    Yes,                      !- Do Space Heat Balance for Sizing
    Yes;                      !- Do Space Heat Balance for Simulation
```
These currently result in additional output variables for Space, but nothing more.

### Extend Spaces to Sizing
When "Do Space Heat Balance for Sizing" is active, the following sizing changes will be active:

1. Sizing results will be reported for every Space and Zone.
2. Space sizing will follow the same method currently used for Zone sizing.
3. Zone sizing will be based on coincident or non-coincident Space sizing results.
4. Zone sizing results will be used to size air loops.
5. Space sizing results will be used to size space-level HVAC if specified.


### Extend Spaces to HVAC
Inputs will be added to describe optional Space-level HVAC equipment, such as:

1. Space air terminal units supplied by a single zone-level air distribution unit. e.g. A zone-level VAV damper supplying multiple space diffusers.
2. Self-contained zone equipment, such as PTACs and fancoil units may be distribute to one or more Spaces.
3. Thermostats will still control a Zone, but they may be placed in a specific Space and will control that Space's temperature.
4. Finish adding Space Name options to various features such as ZoneThermalChimney (if budget allows, otherwise restrict these to single-space zones).


## Approach ##
### Sizing
* Refactor sizing so it can be at the Zone or Space level, with reporting for both.

### HVAC
* Leave exsiting ZoneHVAC inputs as-is with the addition of an optional field or two.
* Add inputs to distribute Zone HVAC equipment supply air flows to one or more Spaces within a Zone.
* Add inputs to distribute non-air Zone HVAC equipment output to one or more Spaces within a Zone.
* Allow thermostat control to be placed in a specific Space or averaged across the Zone.
* Keep return flows at the Zone level.

## Testing/Validation/Data Sources ##

Compare Space vs Zone-level results.

## Input Description ##
Some new objects and some changes to existing objects are proposed.

### ZoneControl:Thermostat:\*
* *Change field "Zone or ZoneList Name" to "Zone or ZoneList or Space or SpaceList Name."*
* When a thermostat is assigned to a Zone, it will calculate the lumped loads to setpoint for all spaces in the zone.
* When a thermostat is assigned to a Space, it will calculate the loads to setpoint for that Space.

### SpaceHVAC:EquipmentConnections
* *New object to connect nodes to a Space, same as ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections, but for Spaces.*

### Sizing ###

When Space sizing is requested, the following arrays will be created for Spaces.

```
    Array2D<DataSizing::ZoneSizingData> ZoneSizing;               // Data for zone sizing (all data, all design)
    EPVector<DataSizing::ZoneSizingData> FinalZoneSizing;         // Final data for zone sizing including effects
    Array2D<DataSizing::ZoneSizingData> CalcZoneSizing;           // Data for zone sizing (all data)
    EPVector<DataSizing::ZoneSizingData> CalcFinalZoneSizing;     // Final data for zone sizing (calculated only)
```

The main calculation flow for Zone sizing is:

* `SizingManager::ManageSizing`
    * Get sizing inputs (`GetOARequirements . . . GetPlantSizingInput`).
    * Loop over sizing environments and days
        ```
          UpdateZoneSizing(state, Constant::CallIndicator::BeginDay);
          Loop over hours and timesteps
            ManageWeather(state);
            UpdateSysSizing(state, Constant::CallIndicator::DuringDay);
            ManageHeatBalance(state);
          UpdateZoneSizing(state, Constant::CallIndicator::EndDay);
        UpdateZoneSizing(state, Constant::CallIndicator::EndZoneSizingCalc);
        ```
        * Repeat (with a pulse) if zone component loads report is requested.
 * `ZoneEquipmentManager::UpdateZoneSizing` (where all the work is done.)
     * `case Constant::CallIndicator::BeginDay:`
         * Do some initializations on `CalcZoneSizing`
     * `case Constant::CallIndicator::DuringDay:`
         * Called from `HVACManager`
         * save the results of the ideal zone component calculation in the CalcZoneSizing sequence variables
         * Works on `ZoneSizing` and `CalcZoneSizing`
     * `case Constant::CallIndicator::EndDay:`
         * Compute moving averages
         * Save values at peak heating and cooling
         * Works on `CalcZoneSizing` and `CalcFinalZoneSizing`
     * `case Constant::CallIndicator::EndZoneSizingCalc:`
         * Apply EMS overrides
         * Output sizing results from `CalcFinalZoneSizing`
         * Move sizing data into final sizing array according to sizing method
         * Works on `CalcZoneSizing`, `CalcFinalZoneSizing`, `ZoneSizing`, and `FinalZoneSizing`
         * Lots going on in here.
     * Each case block has one or more zone loops
         * Move the guts of each loop to a separate function
         * Pass in the pertinent zone or space arrays as function parameters
         * Add a section to collect space results to the zone level
     * When doing Space sizing, which arrays are really needed?
         * All four arrays will be needed for Space `SpaceSizing`, `CalcSpaceSizing`, `CalcFinalSpaceSizing`, and `FinalSpaceSizing`
         * It's possible that only `FinalZoneSizing` is needed at the zone level. But will need to search the code to see if any of the other zone sizing arrays might be accessed elsewhere outside of the zone sizing calcs.
         
### HVAC ###

The main calculation flow for Zone and Space HVAC in `HVACManager:ManageHVAC` is as follows, with notes about changes required for Space-HVAC.

* `ZoneTempPredictorCorrector::ManageZoneAirUpdates(... GetZoneSetPoints)`
    * `CalcZoneAirTempSetPoints`
       * Add Space-level thermostats
* `ZoneTempPredictorCorrector::ManageZoneAirUpdates(... PredictStep)`
    * `PredictSystemLoads`
       * Add Space-level thermostats.
       * Space-level predicted loads are already implemented.
       * Some "TODO: For Now" comments need to be replaced with full Space-level assignments
* `SimHVAC`
    * `SetPointManager::ManageSetPoints(state);`
    * `SimSelectedEquipment`
        * `SimAirServingZones::ManageAirLoops`
        * `ZoneEquipmentManager::ManageZoneEquipment`
            * Add functions here to distribute zone-level airflows and non-air HVAC equipment output to Spaces
        * `PlantManager::ManagePlantLoops`
* `ZoneTempPredictorCorrector::ManageZoneAirUpdates(... CorrectStep)`
    * `correctZoneAirTemps`
       * Space-level corrections for air temps and humidity are already implemented.
       * Some "TODO: For Now" comments need to be replaced with full Space-level assignments
