## Justification for Feature Update

As global climate change continues, the frequency, duration and intensity of heatwaves could increase. As an affordable and energy efficient cooling option [1], evaporative cooling could become more prevalent in the future, especially in hot and dry climates. As a result, it is crucial to provide accurate and more user-friendly simulation support for prototyping new evaporative coolers and their applications. With this motivation, this EnergyPlus feature is proposed to provide an additional relative humidity-driven control option.

The enhancement was motivated by discussions with the CBE research group at UC Berkeley: Hui Zhang, Roberto Rugani, and Maria Andre.

## Overview ##

The introduction of excessive moisture is one of the potential issues of direct evaporative coolers. A humidity control could become useful in preventing the evaporative cooler from raising indoor humidity to an uncomfortable level. Currently, the direct evaporative cooler can be controlled with the sensor node temperature using AvailabilityManagers (*AvailabilityManager:LowTemperatureTurnOff* or *AvailabilityManager:HighTemperatureTurnOn*). This feature proposes to add a relative humidity (RH) control to shut down the evaporative cooler when the indoor relative humidity is too high.

We plan to enhance the zone level evaporative cooler object, *ZoneHVAC:EvaporativeCoolerUnit*. This is a compound object that combines a fan and one
Each evaporative cooler in this object can be a direct or indirect. This feature will add some additional fields to this zone-level object, allowing user to specify a relative-humidity threshold above which the unit will be turned off.

## Approach

To enable a high-relative-humidity-cutoff control, a field will be added to the *ZoneHVAC:EvaporativeCoolerUnit* object. See Section IDD object change for details.

## Testing/Validation/Data Source(s)

This feature will be tested and demonstrated with a test file derived from StripMallZoneEvapCooler.idf. Manual check of the time-step EnergyPlus simulation results will be conducted to confirm the added feature is working correctly.
