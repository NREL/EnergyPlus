## Justification for Feature Update

Currently, EnergyPlus assumes constant thermal and solar absorptance for exterior wall and roof materials. In order to model dynamic coatings with changing solar or thermal absorptance, users need to use the EnergyManagementSystem (EMS) feature to write code to overwrite these properties. Although this can be done by advanced users, it can be a challenge for normal EnergyPlus users as learning and debugging EMS code is not an easy task. 

The proposed new feature will enable user input of the stimulus-absorptance relationship in the form of a table or curve. The variables triggering solar or thermal absorptance change can be surface temperature, solar radiation, space heating/cooling status, a schedule, etc. An idd object will be added to capture detailed input of solar and thermal absorptance as a function of different triggers.

## Overview ##

Dynamic coatings are among the hottest topics of novel building materials that have significant potentials of reducing heating and cooling loads in buildings. Such materials can change their solar or thermal absorptance with a variety of triggers. Based on the type of triggers, they can be classified into passive and active. Most passive dynamic coatings are driven by surface temperature. For these materials, there is usually a high value and a low value for thermal emissivity or solar reflectance. When the surface temperature is higher than a certain threshold, the material will switch to a state with high emissivity or reflectance. When the surface temperature is lower than a certain threshold (which could be different from the previous one), the material will switch to another state with lower emissivity or reflectance. Active dynamic coatings can be tuned with control signals based on space heating/cooling status, occupancy, indoor temperature or thermal comfort metrics. The control signal can actuate the change in material optical/thermal properties by changing the position of movable structures, applying forces, or distributing chemical content to the material. The following table lists examples of dynamic coating studies with various triggers.

|Active	|Mechanical structure|[5], [6]|

||Electric current|[10]|

Based on the above brief review of dynamic coating material, we propose to enable the modeling of the trigger-solar/thermal absorption in EnergyPlus directly as opposed to relying on EMS. We propose to add a new Material object to hold trigger-solar/thermal absorption curve or table data. This user input will overwrite the corresponding material properties based on the value of the trigger.

## Approach

A new idd object, *MaterialProperty:VariableAbsorptance*, will be added to host user input data on the trigger-coating property relationship.

## Testing/Validation/Data Source(s)

The feature will be tested and demonstrated with a test file derived from *"RefBldgSmallOfficeNew2004_Chicago.idf* with various dynamic coatings. The simulation results will be verified against the EMS approach. One of the dynamic coating material to be simulated is from Professor Junqial Wu’s group at UC Berkeley [11]. The following is a plot of its surface temperature-emissivity relationship.

## IDD Object changes

There could be two potential idd designs as follows. The first design creates a material object with the full set of properties users can specify, including roughness, thickness, conductivity, etc. The second approach will add the specification of the trigger-solar/thermal absorption alone. The first approach has the flexibility of specifying the roughness, thickness, conductivity, etc. for the new material itself, but on the other hand, could be challenging for users when some of this information is not readily available. The second approach only requires the trigger-solar/thermal absorptance information, which could be handy for users to test out the performance of the coating while assuming the coating itself is thin enough and the conductivity difference between the coating and the opaque layer beneath it is negligible. When the "coating" is a thick structure, where such differences are not negligible, users can first create a *Material* layer with the roughness, thickness, conductivity, etc. of the thick dynamic coating layer, then add the *MaterialProperty:VariableAbsorptance* on top of it to hold the trigger-solar/thermal absorptance data.

Based on the reasoning above, two material add-on objects will be added, *MaterialProperty:VariableAbsorptance*.
