## Justification for New Feature ##

Many Water-to-Air Heat Pump units and VRF indoor units in the market are equipped with multi-speed components to reduce energy use and noise. During actual operation, the fan air flow is coordinated with the compressor stage control. At low compression stage, the fan is going to run at low air flow rate. To support this operation, supply air flow ratio input fields (low, medium, high) should be added to the ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump and ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow objects. In simulation, for each time step, the fan air flow shall cycle between adjacent speeds based on the cooling / heating capacity (or coordinate with the cooling / heating coil stage for variable speed water to air coils).

### EnergyPlus Technicalities on 11/30/22 ###

The conference call focused on the issue whether we need to use the exsting object of UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed or not, if the FanModel object can be used to simulate multiuple fan speeds. The suggestion is to provide comparison between two objects. 

###Action item:###

Add a section to compare both objects to see whether FanSystemModel can be used to specify multispeed fans.

###Action response on 11/30/22###

@mjwitte @Myoldmopar @rraustad @EnergyArchmage

Based on discussion in the conference call today, I revised the NFP by adding a section to show differences between between UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed and Fan:SystemModel for review.

The Fan:SystemModel does not have No Load Supply Air Flow Rate Ratio, and different fan flow ratios between heating and cooling.

Justification
No Load Supply Air Flow Rate Ratio
As long as the No Load Supply Air Flow Rate is designed in the parent object correctly, there is no need to have this field.

Different fan flow ratios between heating and cooling
The real system has only a single supply fan.

Please let me know your comments via E-mail.

Thanks.

###Email communication on 1/4/23###

####My request on 1/4/22####

All:

Happy New Year! I came back to the US after Christmas. I started to work from today after a China trip.

The new feature proposal was discussed on Nov. 30, 2022. The main topic is if we use either Fan:SystemModel or UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed. I submited my response to show differences between two objects in https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/9746:

####Mike comments on 1/4/22####

@lgu1234 Using the speeds in Fan:SystemModel to inform the parent object is desirable, because it avoids duplicate input. But it would introduce a new paradigm.

My understanding is that none of the current parent objects mine this information from the fan. The parent objects decide on a flow rate and tell the fan where it's operating. Then the fan calculates it's power use based on interpolating between the speeds. @rraustad is that correct?

Since ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump is actually using the UnitarySystem code, the most expedient approach seems to be to use UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed for this one. It should require minimal new code.

If UnitarySystem does not currently throw any warnings for inconsistent flow fractions between UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed and the Fan:SystemModel object, then I would suggest adding these checks as part of this PR.

For ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow it would then make sense to keep the same approach and use UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed.

Another alternative is to support both methods: If UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed is specified, then use it. If not, check the fan inputs and use those.

@rraustad @EnergyArchmage ?

###Action after Mike's comments###

The object of UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed will be used in this new feature for both ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump and ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow.

Warnings will be issued if UnitarySystem does not currently throw any warnings for inconsistent flow fractions between UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed and the Fan:SystemModel object, but speed fractions from UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed will be used.

The alternative method will be included if I have time left: If UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed is specified, then use it. If not, check the fan inputs and use those.

###Discussion in the E+ Technicalities on 1/11/23###

NFP approach was discussed one more time. After the Technicalities, Rich and I also talked about approach for VRF teminal object. At the same time, Tianzhen send me an E-mail and informed me as below:

Lixing,

The version of VRF models ( AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl) developed by us collaborating with Daikin already can handle indoor fan speed control for indoor coil/unit. Your new feature should only apply to the VRF models developed by FSEC/Rich, which currently uses constant speed fan in indoor coil/units.

Let me know if you have questions.

Article attached fyi.

## Overview ##

The ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil object allows multi-speed cycling fan with constant water flow rate. MultiSpeedFan is one of choices defined in the Capacity Control Method field. The object has two fields to defind Low Speed Supply Air Flow Ratio, and Medium Speed Supply Air Flow Ratio. Therefore, it has 3 fan speeds to be applied to the object. The fan air flow cycles between adjacent speeds based on the cooling/heating capacity. It is obvious that 3 speed fan operation may not be general enough. If a user wants more or less speed operation, more fields are needed. In addition, water flow rate remains the same with different air flow rates. 

The AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem object allows multispeed coils with two fields input: Design Specification Multispeed Object Type and Design Specification Multispeed Object Name. The advatage to introduce an object to define multispeed coils is to provide more choices for users to define fan flow ratios with heating, cooling and no load conditions.

The proposed changes, to mimic AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem, are to add two optional fields in both ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump and ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow objects to specify UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed as:

Design Specification Multispeed Object Type
Design Specification Multispeed Object Name

The alternative method will be included if I hvae time left: If UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed is specified, then use it. If not, check the fan inputs and use those.

### Final approach ###

This section provides final approach after several rounds of discussion.


#### ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump ####

ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump allows two types of coils: Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit and Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit.

#####Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit#####

Allow multispeed airflow rate. If UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed is specified, then use it. If not, check the fan inputs and use those.

#####Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit#####

The object already defines coil properties at different speeds. I need to check the speed numbers of cooling and heating defined in the UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed or Fan:SystemModel to ensure they are equal. The rest of procedure will be similar to AirToAir Multispeed HP or VariableSpeedCoils in the UnitarySystem

####ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow####

ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow allows two types of coils: Coil:Heating/Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow and Coil:HeatingCooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl.

#####Coil:Heating/Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow#####

Since the current ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow only allows single speed coils, the multiple speed fan will be allowed after adding the UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed fields. The fan air flow cycles between adjacent speeds based on the cooling/heating capacity for Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow and Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow only. This approach is simlar to Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit

#####Coil:Heating/Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl#####

Since Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl and Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl require variable speed fans, the multiple speed fans are not applied to both coils. In addition, based on description provided by LBL, the coils can handle indoor fan speed control for indoor coil/unit. No effort is needed from this new feature.  
  

## Approach ##

As mentioned in the previous section, two new optional fields are proposed in the both ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump and ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow objects.

###ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump###

Two optional new fields are added to allow a multiple speed fan.

	...
  	A21, \field Design Specification Multispeed Object Type
       \type choice
       \key UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed
       \note Enter the type of performance specification object used to describe the multispeed coil or fan.
  	A22; \field Design Specification Multispeed Object Name
       \type object-list
       \object-list UnitarySystemPerformaceNames
       \note Enter the name of the performance specification object used to describe the multispeed coil or fan.

If the entered heating coil type is Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit, the multiple fan speeds are allowed, the full water flow rate is assumed. The fan air flow cycles between adjacent speeds based on the cooling/heating capacity.

If the entered heating coil type is Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit, the input of Number of Speeds should be the same number defined in FanPerformance:Multispeed. The fan air flow speed coordinates with the cooling/heating coil stage for variable speed water to air coils.

If the entered cooling coil type is Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit, the multiple fan spees are allowed, the full water flow rate is assumed. The fan air flow cycles between adjacent speeds based on the cooling/heating capacity.

If the entered cooling coil type is Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit, the input of Number of Speeds should be the same number defined in FanPerformance:Multispeed. The fan air flow speed coordinates with the cooling/heating coil stage for variable speed water to air coils.

###ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow###

Two optional new fields are added to allow a multiple speed fan.

	...
  	A20, \field Design Specification Multispeed Object Type
       \type choice
       \key UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed
       \note Enter the type of performance specification object used to describe the multispeed coil or fan.
  	A21; \field Design Specification Multispeed Fan Object Name
       \type object-list
       \object-list UnitarySystemPerformaceNames
       \note Enter the name of the performance specification object used to describe the multispeed coil or fan.

Allowed heating and cooling coils:
 
	Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow
	Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl
	Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow
	Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl

Since ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow only allows single speed coils, listed below, no multiple speed coils will be applied. The multiple speed fan will be allowed after adding the FanPerformance:Multispeed field. The fan air flow cycles between adjacent speeds based on the cooling/heating capacity for Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow and Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow only.

Since Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl and Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl require variable speed fans, the multiple speed fans are not applied to both coils.

####Differences####

The Fan:SystemModel does provide multiple flow fration. The UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed object provides more choices than the Fan:SystemModel with No Load Supply Air Flow Rate Ratio, and different fan flow ratios between heating and cooling. The latter (different flow ratios between cooling and heating) can be justified, because the real system has only a single supply fan. The real missed item is No Load Supply Air Flow Rate Ratio. As long as the No Load Supply Air Flow Rate defined in the parent object is desinged correctly, the ratio input can be avoided. 

## Testing/Validation/Data Sources ##

Unit test and example file test will be performed to ensure all simulations results meet expectation.

## Design Document ##

This document covers 3 types of coils, implemented in two modules: UnitarySystem and HVACVariableRefrigerantFlow. The UnitarySystem covers two types of coils: Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit and Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit. The HVACVariableRefrigerantFlow covers a single type of coil: Coil:Heating/Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow.

### Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit ###

Several functions will be modified in the UnitarySystem module to allow multiple airflow rates with the fixed water flow. The functions included GetInput, Sizing, and Report.

#### Sizing ####

If autosize is required, linear discrete size of fan flow rates are assigned. The cooling coil air flow size code is provide below. The heating coil flow size will be similaer. 

               // airflow sizing
                Real64 AirFlowRate = WaterToAirHeatPumpSimple::GetCoilAirFlowRate(
                    state, DataHVACGlobals::cAllCoilTypes(this->m_CoolingCoilType_Num), this->m_CoolingCoilName, ErrFound);
                if (this->m_NumOfSpeedCooling > 1) {
                    for (int i = 1; i <= this->m_NumOfSpeedCooling; ++i) {
                        if (state.dataUnitarySystems->designSpecMSHP[this->m_DesignSpecMSHPIndex].coolingVolFlowRatio[i] == DataSizing::AutoSize) {
                            this->m_CoolVolumeFlowRate[i] = double(i) / double(this->m_NumOfSpeedCooling) * AirFlowRate;
                        } else {
                            this->m_CoolVolumeFlowRate[i] =
                                state.dataUnitarySystems->designSpecMSHP[this->m_DesignSpecMSHPIndex].coolingVolFlowRatio[i] * AirFlowRate;
                        }
                        this->m_CoolMassFlowRate[i] = this->m_CoolVolumeFlowRate[i] * state.dataEnvrn->StdRhoAir;
                    }

                        this->m_HeatMassFlowRate[i] = 0.0;
                        this->m_HeatVolumeFlowRate[i] = 0.0;
                        this->m_MSHeatingSpeedRatio[i] = 1.0;

In addition, set up bool varibales as true:

                        this->m_MultiSpeedHeatingCoil = true;
                        this->m_MultiOrVarSpeedHeatCoil = true;

If the UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed object is not available, the program will check if the fan type is Fan:SystemModel with Discrete speed control or not. If yes, the multiple fan speed operation is also applied. Since the Fan:SystemModel only provideds the number of speeds without specification of heating and cooling, the same number for heating and cooling will be applied.

##### Set up airflow rate with auto size given in UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed #####

If the supply heating and cooling flow rates are given in the inputs, the multiple speed airflows will be determined in the input function with or without autosize. The procedure is similar with one provided in the sizing.

##### Set up corresponding output variables

                        SetupOutputVariable(state,
                                            "Unitary System Water Coil Cycling Ratio",

                                            OutputProcessor::Unit::None,
                                            state.dataUnitarySystems->unitarySys[sysNum].m_SpeedNum,
                                            OutputProcessor::SOVTimeStepType::System,

###Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit###

The example file library does not provide the test file with selected Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit coil under ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump. I modified an example file of DOAToWaterToAirInlet.idf to replace Coil:Heating/Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit by Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit. Due to mismatch of airflows, although Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit coils have 10 speed, the parent object does not have such capability, so that no multiple speed airflows are simulateed. 

The proposed revisions to adopt inputs of multiple speed fans are described below: 

#### Modify input ####

The GetInput function will be modified to read two new fields and accept the UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed.
Since the coil specifies the number of speed. The number of speed from the UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed should match the number of speed from the coil. If not, a warning is issued and the number of speed from the coil will be used.

#### Check the number speeds from both the coil and UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed ####

The nuymber of speeds should match each other. If not, the number of speeds from coil prevails. In other words, the number of speed provided from UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed will be overridden. At the same time, a warning will be posted in the err file to let users be aware of the changes.

#### Craete corresponding output variables to present the speed number, cycle ratio and speed ratio, to be consistent with other multuiple speed coils and fans.     

#### Modify the OutputControl function ####

A similar procedure with multipseed AirToAirHeatPump coil will be implemented.

###Coil:Heating/Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow###

Modifications will be performed in the HVACVariableRefrigerantFlow module

#### GetVRFInputData ####

1. Read two new fields
2. Get index of UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed
3. Assign number of cooling and heating speeds from UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed
4. Create new arrays for volumatric and mass flow rates in size of number of cooling and heating speeds.
5. When the supply airflows are not autosize, assign airflows to the new array with or without autosize

            }

        }


#### Sizing

The sizing of supply flow rates are determined in the sizing function. The rest of flow rates at different speeds are determined by flow fraction provided in UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed. If the UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed object fields are autosized, the proportional fraction ratios will be provided.

        // Multispeed Fan cooling flow sizing
        if (state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).NumOfSpeedCooling > 0) {
            Real64 AirFlowRate = state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).MaxCoolAirVolFlow;
            for (int i = 1; i <= state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).NumOfSpeedCooling; ++i) {
                if (state.dataUnitarySystems->designSpecMSHP[state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).DesignSpecMSHPIndex].coolingVolFlowRatio[i] ==
                    DataSizing::AutoSize) {
                    state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).CoolVolumeFlowRate[i] =
                        double(i) / double(state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).NumOfSpeedCooling) * AirFlowRate;
                } else {
                    state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).CoolVolumeFlowRate[i] =
                        state.dataUnitarySystems->designSpecMSHP[state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).DesignSpecMSHPIndex]
                            .coolingVolFlowRatio[i] *
                        AirFlowRate;
                }
                state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).CoolMassFlowRate[i] =
                    state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->VRFTU(VRFTUNum).CoolVolumeFlowRate[i] * state.dataEnvrn->StdRhoAir;
            }
        }


#### SetAverageAirFlow 

The currect function set up average airflow is based on system on and off flow rate adjusted by part load ratio. When multiple speed fan is used, the average flow rates may be determined by speed ratio with two consecutive fan speeds. The procedure mimics the one from UnitarySystem.

If multiple speed fan is applied, the average air flow rate is given in two scenarios:

##### Speed Number = 1 #####

        AverageUnitMassFlow =
            (PartLoadRatio * state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->CompOnMassFlow) + ((1 - PartLoadRatio) * state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->CompOffMassFlow);

##### Speed Number > 1 #####

Cooling
        AverageUnitMassFlow =
            (SpeedRatio * state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->CoolMassFlowRate[CoolSpeedNum]) + ((1 - SpeedRatio) * state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->CoolMassFlowRate[CoolSpeedNum - 1]);

Heating
        AverageUnitMassFlow =
            (SpeedRatio * state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->HeatMassFlowRate[HeatSpeedNum]) + ((1 - SpeedRatio) * state.dataHVACVarRefFlow->HeatMassFlowRate[HeatSpeedNum - 1]);

#### CalcVRF ####

When multiple speed fan is applied, a for loop will be used to test which speed is used for the terminal unit. The procedure mimics one from HVACAirToAirHeatPump:MUltispeed.
