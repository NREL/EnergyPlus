Welcome to Design Documents
===========================

This is where Design Documents live.  Organization is a simple few rules:

 - No files should be in here with the README unless they are super meta.
 - The files should be organized into folders named FY20\*\*, where the \*\* is replaced with the fiscal year in which the design was first proposed for implementation.  The actual year of implementation changes, so doing it off of that year would require more maintenance down the road.
 - Design documents should be markdown, and named with just a short title of the feature: MyNewCoolModel.md
 - Images should go right alongside the file, and named like: MyNewCoolModel-Figure01.png or similar.  Try to make the images as compressed as possible to avoid bulking up the repo.
 - The design document should be added to your working branch for your new feature, and be reviewed alongside the code, idd, idf, and doc changes.
