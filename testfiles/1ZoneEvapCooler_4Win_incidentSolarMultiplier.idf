! Basic file description:  This file models a small one-zone house with a whole-house direct evaporative cooler system.
!                          Because evaporative coolers cannot be controlled with the ZoneControl:Thermostat object,
!                          this file illustrates how an evaporative cooler system can be thermostatically controlled
!                          in a crude manner using the AvailabilityManager objects:
!
!                              AvailabilityManager:LowTemperatureTurnOff
!                              AvailabilityManager:HighTemperatureTurnOn
!
!                          Availability managers are capable of turning on or off the fan for an air system (or the pump
!                          for a plant system) by monitoring temperature conditions at a user-specified system node.
!                          In this model, the availability managers are monitoring the zone outlet air node to act as
!                          a crude thermostatic control for the zone.
!
!                          Keep in mind that availability manager control is "lagged".  This means that the node
!                          conditions from the previous time step are used to make control decisions at the current
!                          time step.
!
!                          There are two ways to use the availability managers for controlling an evaporative cooler:
!
!                              Method 1.  The fan is scheduled to be available at all times, meaning that the system
!                                         is on all the time by default.  This usually results in over-cooling.
!                                         To prevent over-cooling, the LOW TEMPERATURE TURN OFF object is used to
!                                         turn off the system fan when the temperature falls below the setpoint (23 C).
!
!                              Method 2.  The fan is scheduled to be unavailable at all times, meaning that the system
!                                         is off all the time by default.  This usually results in under-cooling.
!                                         To prevent under-cooling, the HIGH TEMPERATURE TURN ON object is used to
!                                         turn on the system fan when the temperature rises above the setpoint (26 C).
!
!                          With either method, all other equipment is scheduled to be always available.  In this file,
!                          for demonstration purposes only, the fan is scheduled to be available from 12 AM-12 PM to
!                          to demonstrate Method 1, and scheduled to be unavailable from 12 PM-12 AM for Method 2.
!
!                          Note that ZoneControl:Thermostat is still used in this model to control the baseboard
!                          heating in the winter, but it does not effect the evaporative cooler system.
