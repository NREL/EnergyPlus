!                                (West)   Air flow rate when compressor is off is either cooling or heating air flow
!                                         during last compressor ON cycle since the fan continues to operate when the
!                                         compressor is off (ContFanCycComp).
!                                         Cooling and heating coils are scheduled on all year.
!                                         Thermostat uses dual set point.
!                                         The fan for this PTHP is also set up to model a multi-speed fan motor.

!                                (East)   Air flow rate when compressor is off is 0 since the fan cycles off with the
!                                         compressor (CycFanCycComp).
