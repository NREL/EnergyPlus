! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 4 exterior and one interior conditioned zones and return plenum
!                          Illustrates the use of a dedicated outdoor air system  (DOAS) with water to air heatpumps (WLHP)
!                          The DOAS air is ducted to the inlet side of the WLHP units and mixed with zone (exhaust) air
!                          through the use of inlet side mixer terminal units.
! Highlights:              Multispeed fan with UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed used in EquationFit coils for Space1-1
!                          Multispeed fan with UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed used in variable speed coils for Space2-1

!
! Building: Single floor rectangular building 100 ft x 50 ft. 5 zones - 4 exterior, 1 interior, zone height 8 feet.
!           Exterior zone depth is 12 feet. There is a 2 foot high return plenum: the overall building height is
!           10 feet. There are windows on all 4 facades; the south and north facades have glass doors.
!           The south facing glass is shaded by overhangs. The walls are woodshingle over plywood, R11 insulation,
!           and gypboard. The roof is a gravel built up roof with R-3 mineral board insulation and plywood sheathing.
!           The windows are of various single and double pane construction with 3mm and 6mm glass and either 6mm or
!           13mm argon or air gap.  The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.29.
!           The south wall and door have overhangs.
!
!           The building is oriented 30 degrees east of north.
