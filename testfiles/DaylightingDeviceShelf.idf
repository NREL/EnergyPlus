! Basic file description:
! This model consists of two separate buildings.  Both buildings are identical in geometry and construction.
! Both buildings have a two-piece window composed of an upper and a lower window on the south wall.
! On one of the buildings a daylighting shelf projects between the two windows with inside and outside
! surfaces.  All interior surfaces except floor are painted white for optimal daylight distribution.
! An illuminance map is output for both building zones.
! Run:      2 design days.
! Building: Standard constructions.  Floors are partitions.  No shading between buildings.
! Internal: Added lights from DaylightingDeviceTubular
! System:   None.
! Plant:    None.
! FCW, 6/17/04: changed height for daylighting illuminance maps from 0.0m to 0.8m to correspond
!               to reference point height
