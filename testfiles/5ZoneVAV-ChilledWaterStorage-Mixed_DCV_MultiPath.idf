! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 4 exterior and one interior conditioned zone
!
! Highlights:              Illustrates the use of a Mixed chilled water storage tank to load a chiller at night
!                          The DCV method is the ventilation rate procedure (VRP) defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007.
!                            The method considers the zone air distribution effectiveness and system ventilation efficiency.
!                          Added zone maximum outdoor air fraction as part of BMS OA zone level control.
