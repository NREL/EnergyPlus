! Basic file description:
! This model consists of two separate buildings.  Both buildings are identical in geometry and construction.
! Both have a main zone with an attic zone above.  In one building the main zone is a daylit zone,
! illuminated by two tubular daylighting devices (TDDs) of different lengths with supplemental fluorescent
! lighting continuously dimmable to a controlled minimum setpoint.  In the other building the main zone is a
! "standard" zone, illuminated by fluorescent lighting alone.  Both zones are conditioned using ideal loads
! to compare differences in heating and cooling loads.
! Run:      2 design days.  Try other locations for effect of latitude on TDD performance.
! Building: Standard constructions.  Floors are partitions.  No windows.  No shading between buildings.
! Internal: Lights at approximately "normal" levels on 24 hour schedule.
! System:   Ideal Loads
! Plant:    None.
! FCW, 6/17/04: changed height for daylighting illuminance map from 0.0m to 0.8m to correspond
!               to reference point height
