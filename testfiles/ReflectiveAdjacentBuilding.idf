!
! Detached Shading:               1
!
!   The detached shade models  a building to the north with a highly-glazed, reflective facade. Depending on the
!   sun position, this facade can reflect beam solar radiation back onto the north window,
!   substantially increasing the solar radiation incident on that window. (The same facade can
!   alos reflect sky solar radiation back onto this window, but this is a smaller effect.)
!   The calculation of solar reflection from exterior obstructions is triggered by setting
!   Calculate Solar Reflection From Exterior Surfaces = YES in the BUILDING object.
!
!   The reflecting facade is represented by a SURFACE:SHADING:DETACHED:FIXED object. The reflective
!   properties of this surface are specified in an associated SHADING SURFACE REFLECTANCE object.
!   This object indicates that the reflecting facade is 80% glazed. The program determines the
!   beam reflectance of the glazed portion as a function of solar incidence angle from the glazing
!   construction, "Reflective Double Pane," that is specified in this object. The unglazed part of
!   the facade has a (diffuse) reflectance of 30%. (Note that this facade, besides reflecting beam
!   and sky diffuse solar radiation onto the target building, also acts as a shadowing surface.)
!
!   The solar radiation reflected onto the north window from the adjacent facade can be seen in various
!   report variables, including:
!     Surface Ext Beam Sol From Bm-To-Bm Refl From Obstructions,
!     Surface Ext Diff Sol From Bm-To-Diff Refl From Obstructions, and
!     Surface Ext Solar From Sky Diff Reflection From Obstructions.
