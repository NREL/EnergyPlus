!                                 The overhead electric lighting has continuous dimming control.
!                                 The zone has a single daylighting control point ("reference point") with
!                                 an illuminance set point of 500 lux (about 50 footcandles).
!                                 The reference point is located at the center of the zone at desk height.
!                                 The other zones have no windows and so have no daylighting controls.
!                                 Note that Clearness for the winter design day is not 0.0, as in the other
!                                 sample inputs, but 1.0. This turns on solar radiation in order to show the
!                                 effect of daylighting in the winter. (With Clearness = 0 all daylighting
!                                 illuminances are zero)  An illuminance map is also generated.
