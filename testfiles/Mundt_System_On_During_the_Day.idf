! Basic file description: Basic test for Mundt nodal air model
!                          1 story building divided into 3 interior conditioned zones. Roof with no plenum.
!                          No ground contact with floor.
!
! Highlights:              Example of Mundt Mixing Air Model
!
! Simulation Location/Run: TAMPA_INTL_AIRPORT_FL_USA, 2 design days, 2 run periods,
!                          Run Control executes two design days (see RUN PERIOD object)
!
! Location:                Tampa, FL
!
! Design Days:             TAMPA_INTL_AIRPORT_FL_USA Annual Heating 99% Design Conditions DB, MaxDB= -17.3°C
!                          TAMPA_INTL_AIRPORT_FL_USA Annual Cooling 1% Design Conditions, MaxDB=  31.5°C MCWB=  23.0°C
!
! Run Period (Weather File): 6/15 to 7/15, TAMPA_INTL_AIRPORT_FL_USA
!
! Run Control:             No zone or system sizing, design day run control (no weather file simulation)
! Run:      2-design-day and a 1-month simulation.
! Building: A simple 3 room, 4 zone building was devised to illustrate use of the Mundt room air model. The 'Mid' room is divided
!           into an upper and lower zone.  'Mixing' models are used for these two zones.  The West and East room are modeled as
!           single zones with multiple surfaces on each wall.  The zones are 12 m tall to illustrate the effect of thermal
!           stratification in the rooms.
!
! Floor Area:        48 m2
