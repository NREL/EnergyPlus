! Added thermochromic window to the Small Office model in the DOE Commercial Building Benchmark
!
! A sample thermochromic window construction is assigned to the window Perimeter_ZN_1_wall_south_Window_1.
!
! Three time-step report variables were added to help diagnostics
!  Output:Variable,Perimeter_ZN_1_wall_south_Window_1,Window Thermochromic Layer Temperature,timestep; !- Zone Average [C]
!  Output:Variable,Perimeter_ZN_1_wall_south_Window_1,Window Thermochromic Layer Specification Temperature,timestep; !- Zone Average [C]
!  Output:Variable,Perimeter_ZN_1_wall_south_Window_1,Window Transmitted Solar,timestep; !- Zone Average [W]
!
! The overall window properties (U/SHGC/VT) of the thermochromic window at different specification temperatures are reported in the EIO file.

! Description:  Single story, five zone office building.
! Form:         Area = 511 m2 (5,500 ft2); Number of Stories = 1; Shape = rectangle, Aspect ratio = 1.5
! Envelope:     Envelope thermal properties vary with climate according to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.
!               Opaque constructions: mass walls; attic roof; slab-on-grade floor
!               Windows: window-to-wall ratio = 19%, equal distribution of punched windows
!               Infiltration = 0.4 cfm/ft2 above grade wall area at 0.3 in wc (75 Pa) adjusted to 0.016 in wc (4 Pa).
!                              25% of full value when ventilation system on.
! HVAC:         PSZ-AC, gas furnace
!               No economizer
!
! Int. gains:   lights = 10.76 W/m2 (1.0 W/ft2);
