! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 3 interior conditioned zones. Roof with Attic Zone.
!
! Highlights:              Example of AirToAir Heat Pump With Integral-Collector-Storage (ICS) solar domestic hot
!                          water heater system. The hot water loop has two storage tanks to maximize the performance
!                          of the collector. The ICS collector are conected to the source side of one of the hot
!                          water tank, whcih has no electrical heating element. A thermostat and humidistat are used
!                          to control temperature and relative humidity of the control zone.
!
!
! Simulation Location/Run: Miami Intl Ap FL USA WMO=722020, 2 design days, 2 run periods.
!                          Run Control executes the run periods and design days. A Miami weather file is required.

!           There is a single window in the West zone south wall. The walls are 1 in stucco over 4 in common
!           brick and gypboard. The three zones are seperated from the attic zone by a ceiling with plywood,
!           cieling air gap, and gypboard. The roof is a built up of Asphalt Shingle and 1/2 in Plywood Siding.
!           The window is single pane 3mm clear. The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.07.

! HVAC:                           3 zone central system using single air loop. DX cooling coil, DX heating coil and hot
!                                 water coil supplemental heating coil. A hot water plant loop provides the hot water.
!                                 Dual setpoint thermostat with setback temperature. Cooling setpoint is 24 C in the
!                                 daytime with 30 C set up temperature. Heating setpoint is 21 C in the daytime with
!                                 18 C set back temperature. Humidistat is set at 50% all year. An economizer is used
!                                 to provide free cooling when available. The economizer uses a 25 C maximum and 14 C
!                                 minimum outdoor temperature limit. In addition, a maximum outdoor dew point
!                                 temperature of 13.5 C and an electronic enthalpy curve (A) is used to further
!                                 limit economizer operation. A high humidity control option also increases the amount
!                                 of outdoor air when indoor relative humidities are above the humidistat set point
!                                 and the outdoor air humidity ratio is lower than the indoor humidity ratio.
!                                 Fresh air is also introduced each weekday from 7:00 am to 7:30 am to purge contaminants
!                                 from the building interior.
