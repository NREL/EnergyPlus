! GSHPSimple-GLHE.idf
! Basic File Description:
! HeatPump:WatertoWater:EquationFit Cooling & Heating and GLHE
! Condenser Loop Served by GROUND LOOP HEAT EXCHANGER
! heat gains due to light equipment and occupation increased
! Basic file description: Basic test of the HeatPump:WatertoWaterSimple Cooling & Heating
! Run:      Two periods in Jan and July.
! Building: Fictional 3 zone building with interzone partitions connecting all zones together.
!           No ground contact (all floors are "partitions").  Roofs exposed to outdoor environment.
!           There is one single pane window.
! Internal: People, equipment, and lighting all at approximately "normal" levels and schedules.
! System:   3 zone terminal reheat system using a single air loop.  Controlled about like the old
!           BLAST "NWS2" control profile.  Heating up to 21 C during occupied hours, 18 C otherwise.
!           Cooling to 24 C while occupied, 30 C otherwise.  Fans and coils scheduled to be unavailable
!           during unoccupied hours.  Cooling coil off all winter.  Reheat coil on all year.
!           System configuration is very basic--air loop has a fan and cooling coil, each zone leg has
!           nothing more than a reheat coil.
! Plant:    Heating loop served by water-to-water heat pump (heating).  Cooling loop served by
!           a second water-to-water heat pump (cooling). Both heatpumps are on the same condenser
!           loop. Heat rejection/extraction from the environment is via a ground loop heat exchanger
!           system.  Priority based controls determine which piece of equipment
!           tries to meet the load.
