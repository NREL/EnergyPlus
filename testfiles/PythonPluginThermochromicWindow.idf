!  EMS emulation of thermochromic window model in ThermochromicWindow, which was from Small Office DOE Commercial Reference Building
!
! A sample thermochromic window construction is assigned to the window Perimeter_ZN_1_wall_south_Window_1.
!
! The overall window properties (U/SHGC/VT) of the thermochromic window at different specification temperatures are reported in the EIO file.
! DOE Commercial Building Benchmark
! Small Office, new construction
! Benchmark V 1.0_3.0
! EnergyPlus V 3.0
! ASHRAE Standards 90.1-2004 and 62-1999
!
! Description:  Single story, five zone office building.
! Form:         Area = 511 m2 (5,500 ft2); Number of Stories = 1; Shape = rectangle, Aspect ratio = 1.5
! Envelope:     Envelope thermal properties vary with climate according to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.
!               Opaque constructions: mass walls; attic roof; slab-on-grade floor
!               Windows: window-to-wall ratio = 19%, equal distribution of punched windows
!               Infiltration = 0.4 cfm/ft2 above grade wall area at 0.3 in wc (75 Pa) adjusted to 0.016 in wc (4 Pa).
!                              25% of full value when ventilation system on.
! HVAC:         PSZ-AC, gas furnace
!               No economizer
!
! Int. gains:   lights = 10.76 W/m2 (1.0 W/ft2);
!               elec. plug loads = 6.78 W/m2 (0.63 W/ft2)
!               gas plug load = 0 W/m2 (0 W/ft2)
!               people = 7.53/100 m2 (7.0/1000 ft2)
