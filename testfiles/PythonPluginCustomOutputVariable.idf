! Envelope:     Envelope thermal properties vary with climate according to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.
!               Opaque constructions: mass walls; attic roof; slab-on-grade floor
!               Windows: window-to-wall ratio = 19%, equal distribution of punched windows
!               Infiltration = 0.4 cfm/ft2 above grade wall area at 0.3 in wc (75 Pa) adjusted to 0.016 in wc (4 Pa).
!                              25% of full value when ventilation system on.
! HVAC:         PSZ-AC, gas furnace
