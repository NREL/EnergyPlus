! Basic file description: This simple 1 story building illustrates the
! use of cost estimate objects.
! There are 10 zones: and 4 exterior and 1 interior inhabited zones and 5 seperate unconditioned,
!           interstitial zones within suspended ceilings.
! Building: single floor,  rectangular building with 1,860 m2 (20,000 sf).  5 zones -
!           4 exterior, 1 interior, floor to floor height 3.8 m. Exterior zone
!           depth is 4.75 m. There is a 0.9 m. high plenum
!           There are windows on all 4 facades with a 30% window to wall ratio
!           Walls are precast concrete panels over R21 foam, R21 batt in metal stud frame, and 5/8 inch gypsum board.
!           The roof is  built up roof with R-40 foam board over metal deck
!           The floor slab is heavy concrete with carpet covering. The windows are quadruple layer
!        !
!           The building is described in relative coordinates and oriented 5 degrees east of north.
!
! Internal: lighting is 10.5 watts/m2, office equip is 30. watts/m2. There
!           are 9 occupants per 100 m2 of floor area. The infiltration is
!           0.1 air changes per hour. Schedules are developed from ASHRAE 90.1-1989
! HVAC:     Standard VAV system with outside air economizer, hot water reheat
!           coils, central chilled water cooling coil. Central Plant is single
!           hot water boiler, electric compression chiller with water cooled
!           condenser, and cooling tower. All equipment is autosized and originally from
!           HVAC macro templates.
!
! Costs:    The test file illustrates construction cost estimating features.
!           Surfaces are costed using a per-m2 models
!           The autosized electric chiller is costed using a per-kW model based
!           on total cooling capacity.  Low infiltration is modeled using a fixed,
!           general line item cost of $8,500
!           Slightly higher designer and commisioning fees are used in the current model
!           than for the reference case.
!           Tabular report style is HTML.
