!
! Each floor is modeled as four perimeter zones and one core zone. The perimeter
! zones are all 4.57m (15 ft) deep. Windows are modeled as a horizontal strip of
! glazing running the length of each perimeter wall from the middle to the top of
! the wall, for a Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of 0.50. The 4 intermediate floors
! are modeled as 1 floor with a zone multiplier of 4 applied to each zone. The floors
! and ceilings of the zones on the intermediate floor are modeled as adiabatic surfaces.
!
! The building is oriented with its long axis east-west.
!
! Internal loads (peak) are :
!
! Occupancy 36.23 m2/person (390 ft2/person)
! Lighting load  12.59 watts/m2 (1.17 watts/ft2)
! Equipment load 8.07 watts/m2 (0.75 watt/ft2)
! Elevator load 27.75 KW (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET IN THIS FILE)
! Hot-water usage 0.889 l/hour/person (0.0039 gal/min/person) (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET IN THIS FILE)
! Occupied hours 8 through 18 weekdays, 8 to 13 weekends
!
! System controls are:
!
! Heating 21.1 C (70 F) occupied hours, 12,8 C (55 F) unoccupied hours
! Cooling 23.9 C (75 F) occupied hours, 32.2 C (90 F) unoccupied hours
! The basement is unconditioned but has a constant heat source of 6766 watts representing
! the losses from the plant
! Heating and cooling turned on 1 hour early, and turned off 1 hour late
! Outside-air 25 m3/hr/person (15 CFM/person)
! Economizer with limit temperature at 20 C (68 F) (BUT IS SET TO NO ECONOMIZER IN THIS INPUT)
!
! HVAC:     Standard VAV system with minimum outside air , hot water reheat
!           coils, central chilled water cooling coil. Central Plant is single
!           hot water boiler, electric compression chiller with water cooled
!           condenser. All equipment is autosized.
!
!           The supply air temperature setpoint is established by a seasonal reset.
