! Basic file description:  This is a basic test file for EnergyPlus Photovoltaic models
!                          with no zones or heat transfer surfaces.
!                          There is one zone with some heat transfer surfaces and building. A series of photovoltaic arrays are modeled for an entire year.
!                          Demonstrates three different PV models.
! Run:     Run Period (Chicago) with two periods, 7 days each (winter and summer)
!          2 design days to facilitate reverse DD testing.
! Building: Fictional 1 zone building with one wall, one floor, and multiple Roof surfaces.
!           There is a controlled thermal zone with purchased air
!           There are five detached surfaces with different tilt and shading situations
!           Each of the five surfaces has three comparable PV arrays.
! Internal: None.
! System:   None.
! Plant:    None.
!
! Note, this file was completely changed from Ver. 1.1.1 to 1.2 to add tests for different PV generators
! note  this file was changed for Ver. 1.2.2 to add new strategies for ventilated mounting configurations
