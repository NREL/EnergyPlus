! Display Case
! Configuration:   Refrigerated cases configured to represent actual performance of medium and low temp cases.
!                  Self contained display case representative of "plug-in" type case with attached
!                  compressor and condenser section.  Condenser heat for this case is rejected to the zone.
!                  GlassDoorFrozenFood case has a large defrost demand and is therefore broken down into three
!                  identical cases with offset defrost timing.
! Walk In
! Configuration:   Walk-in cooler is modeled using door-opening and stocking schedules.
! Gas Cooler/Condenser: The refrigeration gas cooler/condenser is air cooled.
! Compressors: The compressor performance is taken from the RefrigerationCompressor database.
!
! Simulation Location/Run: USA_FL_Miami.Intl.AP_722020_TMY3, 2 design days, 2 run periods,
!                          Run Control executes the run periods, design days are not simulated.
!
! Location:                Miami, FL USA

!
! Run Period (Weather File): Winter 1/14, Summer 7/7, USA_FL_Miami.Intl.AP_722020_TMY3
!
! Run Control:             No Zone or System sizing required. Simulation uses weather file for run periods.
!
! Building: Single floor rectangular building 150 ft x 150 ft, zone height 14 feet. FaceBrkIns4LWConcBlkGyp_R-11
!           There is 1 door and 2 windows at the front of the building. The exterior walls are Face brick with
!           R-11 insulation and concrete block with gypsum board on the interior surface. Partions wall is 8" concrete
!           block covered with gypsum board on each surface. The roof is a built up roof with 1/2 in slag over 3/8 in
!           felt and membrane with R-11 insulation over 6 in lightweight concrete, an air gap separates the interior
!           acoustical tiles. The windows are single pane 6mm clear and double pane 6mm clear with 6mm air gap.
!           The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.0016.
!
!           The building is oriented due north with front of building facing east.
