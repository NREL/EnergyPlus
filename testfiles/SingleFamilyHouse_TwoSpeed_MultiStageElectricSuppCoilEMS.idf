! Basic file description: A 186 m^2 (2000 ft^2) residential house with slab-on-grade (no ground contact).
!
! Highlights:             This file does the basic test of an air distribution system in a residential home.
!                         A two speed heat pump with a supplmental multistage electric heater provides space heating and cooling, whose stages actuated by EMS program.
!                         It provides thermostat temperature difference between cutout and setpoint.
