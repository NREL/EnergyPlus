! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 4 exterior and one interior conditioned zones and return plenum.
!
! Highlights:              Examples of 2 water to air heat pumps serving a total of 5 zones. These heat pumps are modeled
!                          modeled using the water to air heat pump 'parameter estimation' model  The heat pumps are attached to
!                          a single water loop with a vertical ground loop heat exchanger.

!
! Run Period (Weather File): full annual, CHICAGO_IL_USA TMY2-94846
!
! Run Control:             Zone sizing with weather file run control (no design days ran)
!
! Building: Single floor rectangular building 100 ft x 50 ft. 5 zones - 4 exterior, 1 interior, zone height 8 feet.
!           Exterior zone depth is 12 feet. There is a 2 foot high return plenum: the overall building height is
!           10 feet. There are windows on all 4 facades; the south and north facades have glass doors.
!           The south facing glass is shaded by overhangs. The walls are woodshingle over plywood, R11 insulation,
!           and gypboard. The roof is a gravel built up roof with R-3 mineral board insulation and plywood sheathing.
!           The windows are double pane 6mm clear with 6mm air gap.  The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.29.
!           The south wall and door have overhangs.
!
!           The building is oriented 30 degrees east of north.
