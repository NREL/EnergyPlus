! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 4 exterior and one interior conditioned zones and return plenum.
!
! Highlights:              High humidity Control using variable-speed Water To Air Heat Pumps with pond heat exchanger.  Five water source
!                          heat pumps serve one zone each. These heat pumps are modeled using the water to air heat pump
!                          'equation fit' model.  The heat pumps are attached to a single condenser loop with a pond
!                          water heat exchanger (GroundHeatExchanger:Pond).
