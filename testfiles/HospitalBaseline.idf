! Basic file description: 130 zones, 7 story hospital with central CAV system and a 5 story medical office with a central VAV system
!
! Location: USA IL-CHICAGO-OHARE
! Design Days CHICAGO Ann Htg 99.6% Condns DB, CHICAGO Ann Clg .4% Condns DB=>MWB, CHICAGO Ann Clg .4% Condns WB=>MDB
! Run Period:Annual simulation using USA_IL_Chicago-OHare_TMY2.epw
! Run Control: Annual simulation with autosizing
!
! Building:
! Floor area: 48,960 m2 (527,000 ft2)
! Dimensions: 45.72 m x 30.48 m (150 ft x 100 ft)
! Floor height: 3.048 m (10 ft), no plenum
! Number of Stories: 7 with 5 story attached medical office building
!
! Shell characteristics:
! Roof const: insulation entirely above deck - roof membrane, insulation, metal decking
! Roof insulation: 2.6 m2-K/W (14.8 ft2-hr-F/Btu)
! Wall const: steel framed - sheathing, parallel steel studs and batt insulation, continuous insulation, gypsum board
! Wall insulation: 1.9 m2-K/W (11.1 ft2-hr-F/Btu)
! Window const: double-pane
! Window U-value (north): 3.2 W/m2-K (0.57 Btu/hr-ft2-F)
! Window SHGC (north): 0.5
! Window U-value (non-north): 3.2 W/m2-K (0.57 Btu/hr-ft2-F)
! Window SHGC (non-north): 0.4
! Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR): 0.40
!
! The first two floors contain the dining facilities, laboratory spaces, mechanical rooms, and offices.
! The second floor contains the emergency department and surgery suite.  The third floor contains the birthing center and
! a smaller surgery suite along with the first floor of the patient tower. The fourth floor is modeled with a multiplier of 3
! to make up the second, third, and fouth floor of the patient tower. The seventh floor is the top floor of the patient tower.
! Each floor of the medical office building is modeled as four perimeter zones and one core zone. The perimeter
! zones are all 4.57m (15 ft) deep. Windows are modeled as a horizontal strip of glazing running the length of each perimeter
! wall with a window-to-wall ratio (WWR) of 0.40. All interzone surfaces are adiabatic.
!
! The building is oriented with its long axis east-west.
!
! Internal loads (peak) are:
! Occupancy 12.59 m2/person (135.52 ft2/person)
! Lighting load  12.04 watts/m2 (1.12 watts/ft2)
! Equipment load 28.06 watts/m2 (2.61 watt/ft2)
!
! HVAC:
! System Type: Constant air volume (CAV) air handlers with zone-level hot water reheat.
! Zonal Equipment: CAV terminal boxes with hot water reheat coils.
! Central Air Handling Equipment: Six AHUs: 2 serve the first 2 floors, 2 serve the patient tower, 1 serves the medical office building, and 1
! serves the operating room (OR) zones.
! System Equipment Autosize: Global sizing factor = 1.0. Most zone-level sizing factors = 1.0. Certain MOB zone-level sizing factors = 1.2 or 1.4.
! Coils: Each air handling unit has 4 hot water heating coils and 2 chilled water cooling coils.
! Humidification: Five air handlers are equipped with electric steam humdidifiers (the air handler serving the medical office building is the
! exception). Relative humidity values in the air handler control zones are kept between 30% and 60%.
! Pumps: All pumps are variable speed.
! Boilers: 80% efficient natural gas variable speed boiler
! Chillers: Water-cooled centrifugal speed chiller; COP = 6.1
! Towers: Open, variable speed cooling tower
