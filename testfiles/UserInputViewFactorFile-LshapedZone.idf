! Basic file description:  Basic test for EnergyPlus.  Two L-shaped zones of spandrel walls
!
! Highlights:        The idf includes a UserViewFactor object and produces view factor information
!                    in the .eio file. Two identical L shaped zones are included.  The first one uses
!                    the input view factors, and the second one calculates approximate view factors.
!                    The purpose of the run is to produce the .eio file.  It does not produce other
!                    usable output.  The viewfactorinfo request is included in the Report Object.
!
!
! Simulation Location/Run: Urbana Illinois. One design day. Purpose is not to obtain load information.
!                          Only purpose is to produce the eio file which has the ViewFactorInfo report
!                          information.
!
!
!
! Building: Two fictional 1 zone buildings with spandrel walls.
