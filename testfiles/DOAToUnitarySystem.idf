! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 4 exterior and one interior conditioned zones and return plenum
!                          Illustrates the use of a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with AirLoop Unitary System as zone Equipment.
!                          The DOAS air is ducted to the inlet side of Unitary System and mixed with zone recirculating air through the
!                          use of inlet side mixer terminal units for zones: SPACE1-1, SPACE2-1 and SPACE3-1. The DOAS air is ducted
!                          to the outlet side of the Unitary System and mixed with the Unitary System outlet through the use of supply
!                          side mixer terminal units for zones: SPACE4-1 and SPACE5-1.
!
! Highlights:              DOAS ducted to inlet and supply side of AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem as Zone equipment using AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer
!                          Each AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixers specifies outdoor air flow rate for each zone with OutDoor Air Method = either

!
! Run Period (Weather File): Winter 1/14, Summer 7/7.
!
! Run Control:             Zone sizing required, No System sizing required (Run Control executes 2 design days)
!
! Building: Single floor rectangular building 100 ft x 50 ft. 5 zones - 4 exterior, 1 interior, zone height 8 feet.
!           Exterior zone depth is 12 feet. There is a 2 foot high return plenum: the overall building height is
!           10 feet. There are windows on all 4 facades; the south and north facades have glass doors.
!           The south facing glass is shaded by overhangs. The walls are woodshingle over plywood, R11 insulation,
!           and gypboard. The roof is a gravel built up roof with R-3 mineral board insulation and plywood sheathing.
!           The windows are of various single and double pane construction with 3mm and 6mm glass and either 6mm or
!           13mm argon or air gap.  The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.29.
!           The south wall and door have overhangs.
!
!           The building is oriented 30 degrees east of north.
