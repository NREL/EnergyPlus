! Display Case
! Configuration:   Refrigerated cases configured to represent actual performance of medium and low temp cases.
!                  Self contained display case representative of "plug-in" type case with attached
!                  compressor and condenser section.  Condenser heat for this case is rejected to the zone.
!                  Walk-in cooler is modeled using a low runtime fraction with a 2 day/week stocking schedule.
