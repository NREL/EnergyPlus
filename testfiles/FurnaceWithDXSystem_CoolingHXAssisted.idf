! HVAC:                           3 zone central system using single air loop. DX cooling coil and gas heating coil.
!                                 The DX cooling coil uses a balanced desiccant heat exchanger for improved
!                                 dehumidification. The heat exchanger is controlled via a humidistat setting of 50% RH.
!                                 When the East zone relative humidity is above 45% RH the HX is active, otherwise it is
!                                 off. The thermostat is set at 20 C in winter with 15 C set back temperature, 24 C in
!                                 summer with 30 C set back temperature.
!                                 The cooling coil is scheduled off in winter, the heating coil is scheduled on all year.

!                                 HX used is HEAT EXCHANGER:DESICCANT:BALANCEDFLOW
!                                 This HX uses HEAT EXCHANGER:DESICCANT:BALANCEDFLOW:PERFORMANCE DATA TYPE 1 for
!                                 model inputs and empirical model limits. These limits are checked against actual
!                                 operating conditions during the simulation. If the model min/max limits are
!                                 exceeded, the model inputs are capped at the appropriate min/max boundary and
!                                 this new value is passed to the empirical model to determine the performance.
!                                 NOTE: the capped value is only used to determine performance of the desiccant
!                                 heat exchanger, they are NOT used as the actual operating conditions for the HX.
!                                 For example, if the entering supply air inlet temperature is 25C and the empirical model
!                                 maximum for supply air inlet temperature is 24.5C, then 24.5C is passed to the empirical
!                                 model to determine performance (the same occurs for all independent variable used in
!                                 the empirical model equations). Then the actual operating condition (25C) is used to
!                                 determine the actual supply air outlet temperature. This methodology is used to ensure
!                                 that extrapolation of the empirical model does not occur without warning the user.
!
!                                 If the performance of the desiccant heat exchanger is acceptable, the min/max limits
!                                 may be expanded to eliminate the warning messages (use caution when doing this, some
!                                 empirical models show odd behavior when extrapolation occurs).
!
!                                 This example file shows no warnings due to the use of a desiccant heat exchanger
!                                 for either the design days or an annual simulation using Miami, FL weather.

! Model coefficients generated based on results from a finite difference desiccant dehumidifier
! model for a rotary desiccant heat exchanger with a 50/50 face area split between
! regeneration and process air streams. The wheel is 102 mm (4 inch) deep wheel with a rotational
! speed of 12 revolutions per hour. The desiccant performance is based on a Brunauer Type 3
! isotherm shape with a maximum uptake of 30% and a separate factor of 4.5.
