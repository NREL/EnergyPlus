! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 3 interior conditioned zones. Roof with no plenum.
!
! Highlights:              Example of AirToAir Heat Pump With supplemental hot water heating coil. A thermostat and
!                          humidistat are used to control temperature and relative humidity. The hot water plant loop
!                          on the source side is connected to a flat plate solar collector water heater loop and a hot
!                          water tank (WaterHeater:Mixed) with a electrical heating element.
!

! HVAC:                           3 zone central system using single air loop. DX cooling coil, DX heating coil and hot
!                                 water coil supplemental heating coil. A hot water plant loop provides the hot water.
!                                 Dual setpoint thermostat with setback temperature. Cooling setpoint is 24 C in the
!                                 daytime with 30 C set up temperature. Heating setpoint is 21 C in the daytime with
!                                 18 C set back temperature. Humidistat is set at 50% all year. An economizer is used
!                                 to provide free cooling when available. The economizer uses a 25 C maximum and 14 C
!                                 minimum outdoor temperature limit. In addition, a maximum outdoor dew point
!                                 temperature of 13.5 C and an electronic enthalpy curve (A) is used to further
!                                 limit economizer operation. A high humidity control option also increases the amount
!                                 of outdoor air when indoor relative humidities are above the humidistat set point
!                                 and the outdoor air humidity ratio is lower than the indoor humidity ratio.
!                                 Fresh air is also introduced each weekday from 7:00 am to 7:30 am to purge contaminants
!                                 from the building interior.
