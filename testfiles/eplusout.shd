Shadowing Combinations
..Solar Distribution=Minimal Shadowing, Detached Shading will not be used in shadowing calculations
..In the following, only the first 10 reference surfaces will be shown.
..But all surfaces are used in the calculations.
==================================
Surface=SOUTH WALL is used as Receiving Surface in calculations and is convex.
Number of general casting surfaces=0
Number of back surfaces=0
Number of receiving sub surfaces=2
....Surface=SOUTH WINDOW_WEST
....Surface=SOUTH WINDOW_EAST
==================================
Surface=SOUTH WINDOW_WEST is not used as Receiving Surface in calculations.
Number of general casting surfaces=0
Number of back surfaces=0
Number of receiving sub surfaces=0
