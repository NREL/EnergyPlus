! TranspiredCollectors.idf
! Basic File Description:  1 story mixed use building with  5 office zones and 5 workshop zones.
!
! Highlights:  Demonstrates and tests several Unglazed Transpired Collectors.
!
! Simulation Location/Run: Boulder, Colorado  WeatherFilename=USA_CO_Boulder_TMY2.epw
!
! Building: Single story mixed-use building with offices and workshops.
!           The office wing of the building is on the west end and consists has 1,000 m2 (20 by 50 m) in five occupied
!           thermal zones.  There are five unoccupied interstitial zones above the occupied zones representing suspended ceilings
!           There are five 400 m2 (20 by 20 m) workshops in row that differ only in how they are ventilated and heated using
!           different configurations of Solar Collector:Transpired Unglazed.
!
! Internal Gains description: Offices have typical levels, schedules are from RP-1093.
!
! HVAC:  Offices are conditioned normally using five separate single zone packaged DX systems with gas heat,
!        EXCEPT that the five outside air mixers are all connected to a single Transpired Collector.  These systems are
!        autosized and use DXSystem:AirLoop
!        Workshops are ventilated but not actively cooled.  Heating and Transpired Collectors vary as follows:
!        ZN11_Shop_1 is a constant volume transpired collector with gas auxilary heating coil
!        ZN12_Shop_1 is a constant volume transpired collector with gas auxilary heating coil (same as ZN11) but
!                    with the Van Decker Hollands Brunger 2001 correlation for effectiveness.
!        ZN13_Shop_1 is a constant volume outside air system with no auxilary heating system.
!        ZN14_Shop_1 is a constant volume transpired collector with gas auxilary heating coil (same as ZN11) but
!                     with a hybrid collector where the collector is also a photovoltaic electric power panel.
!        ZN15_Shop_1 is a floating zone
