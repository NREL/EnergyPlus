! Each floor is modeled as four perimeter zones and one core zone. The perimeter
! zones are all 4.57m (15 ft) deep. Windows are modeled as a horizontal strip of
! glazing running the length of each perimeter wall from the middle to the top of
! the wall, for a Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of 0.50. The 4 intermediate floors
! are modeled as 1 floor with a zone multiplier of 4 applied to each zone. The floors
! and ceilings of the zones on the intermediate floor are modeled as adiabatic surfaces.
