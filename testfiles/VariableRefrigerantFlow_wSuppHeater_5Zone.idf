!
! Building: Single floor rectangular building 100 ft x 50 ft. 5 zones - 4 exterior, 1 interior, zone height 8 feet.
!           Exterior zone depth is 12 feet. There is a 2 foot high return plenum: the overall building height is
!           10 feet. There are windows on all 4 facades; the south and north facades have glass doors.
!           The south facing glass is shaded by overhangs. The walls are woodshingle over plywood, R11 insulation,
!           and gypboard. The roof is a gravel built up roof with R-3 mineral board insulation and plywood sheathing.
!           The windows are of various single and double pane construction with 3mm and 6mm glass and either 6mm or
!           13mm argon or air gap.  The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.29.
!           The south wall and door have overhangs.
!
!           The building is oriented 30 degrees east of north.

! HVAC:                           The VRF system uses DX cooling and DX heating coils in each of 5 terminal units.
!                                 Also each of the terminal units also has one of the following supplemental heating coils:
!                                 Coil:Heating:Electric, Coil:Heating:Fuel, Coil:Heating:Water, or Coil:Heating:Steam.
!                                 Once all terminal units are simulated, the condenser attached to those terminal
!                                 units is then simulated. The input is partially autosized.
!                                 Terminal units are set to provide a fixed amount of outdoor air.
