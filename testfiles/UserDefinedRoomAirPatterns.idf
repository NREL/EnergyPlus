! Basic file description: Reasonably complete building model using 9-zone "Rubic's Cube" pattern
! Highlights: Demonstrates and tests user-defined room air temperature patterns (see schematic below)
!               (Room air objects are at end of file)
! Simulation Location/Run: Chicago, 2 design days
! Building: 11 thermal zones, 2,000 m2 floor area. (9 zone floor plate with under floor and suspended ceiling zones)
!                         single story building with relatively tall (4.0 m) occupied zones
!                         There are an excessive number of surfaces in model because
!                         walls are all subdivided in the vertical direction to test
!                         changes in room air temperature
! Internal gains description: lighting level per 90.1, Typical equipment, number of occupants, infiltration etc
! HVAC: Full central VAV system with chiller, boiler, etc.  (orignates from HVAC template)
