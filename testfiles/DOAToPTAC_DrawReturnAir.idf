!
! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 4 exterior and one interior conditioned zones and return plenum
!                          Illustrates the use of a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with Packaged Terminal AirConditioner (PTAC)
!                          The DOAS air is ducted to the inlet side of the PTAC and mixed with zone recirculating air through the
!                          use of inlet side mixer terminal units for zones: SPACE1-1, and SPACE3-1. The DOAS air is ducted
!                          to the outlet side of the PTAC and mixed with the PTAC outlet through the use of supply side mixer
!                          terminal units for zones: SPACE4-1 and SPACE5-1. The DOAS air delivers OA to SPACE2-1 via an uncontrolled
!                          terminal unit.
!
! Highlights:              DOAS ducted to inlet and supply side of ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner using AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer,
!                          except for SPACE2-1, using AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat.
!                          Each AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixers specifies outdoor air flow rate for each zone with OutDoor Air Method = Sum in
!                          DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir.
!                          All zone return air is connected to a return plenum. There are 3 induce nodes and 1 return outlet node as plenum outlets.
!                          PTAC1 serves SPACE1-1 and receives OA from return outlet node. The inlet side mixer draws air from retunr node with
!                          impact of light return heat.
!                          PTAC2 and OA distribution have their own zone inlet nodes. OA entering the terminal unit is from
!                          an induce node, and PTAC2 draws air from a zone exhaust node.
!                          PTAC3 is connected to a ternimal mixer with InletSide connection. The primary air is from DOAS disctribution and the Mixer
!                          draws air from an induce node.
!                          PTAC4 is connected to a ternimal mixer with SupplySide connection. The primary air is from DOAS disctribution via return
!                          plenum outlet, and the PTAC4 draws air from the zone directly.
!                          PTAC5 is connected to a ternimal mixer with SupplySide connection. The primary air is from DOAS disctribution via return
!                          plenum outlet, and the PTAC5 draws air from an induce node of zone plenum.
!                          Mass balance: a sum of all zone return flows = a sum of mass flow rates from outlet node and all induce node.
