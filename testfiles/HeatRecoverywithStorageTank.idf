! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 3 interior conditioned zones. Roof with no plenum.
!                          No ground contact with floor. Outdoor air is modulated based on occupancy and floor area.
!
! Highlights:              Test of the heat recovery loops with 2 generators and the engine driven chiller using the
!                          hot water tank to transfer heat to the hot water loop.  This file does not have a heat source
!                          to the hot water heater and only uses recovered heat.

!                                 Terminal reheat coils trim supply air temperature to meet zone thermostat set point.
!                                 Thermostat setting at 20 C in winter with 15 C set back temperature, 24 C in summer
!                                 with 30 C set back temperature. Cooling coil off in winter, reheat coil on all year.
!
!                                 GENERATOR:COMBUSTION TURBINE and GENERATOR:IC Engine coordinated through the
!                                 ELECTRIC LOAD CENTER:DISTRIBUTION and ELECTRIC LOAD CENTER:GENERATORS, along with the
!                                 Chiller:EngineDriven provide the waste heat for the heat recvoery loop.
!                                 The Electric hot water heater acts as a storage tank and recovers the heat from the Engine driven chiller and
!                                 the generators and stores that energy in the tank.  The water tank is also hooked up to the reheat coils and
!                                 provides the necessary heat to the system either through the recovered heat or the water heater can add
!                                 additional heat to make up the difference.  There is a scheduled domestic hot water demand on the tank which
!                                 increases during the day to put another significant load on the tank for the recovered heat.  The heat addition
!                                 part of the Hot Water heater has been disabled so those loads are met only by heat recovery.
!                                 The scheduled domestic hot water usage can be set to zero, if the user desires, so this could be used just as a
!                                 hot water storage tank.
