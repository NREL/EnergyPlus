!                          ThermalMass object to the three zones using ZoneList
!
! Simulation Location/Run: Miami Intl Ap FL USA WMO=722020, 2 design days, 2 run periods.
!                          Run Control executes the design days only.
!
! Location:                Miami, FL USA
!
! Design Days:             Miami Intl Ap FL USA Annual Heating 99.6%, MaxDB=8.7°C
!                          Miami Intl Ap FL USA Annual Cooling (DB=>MWB) .4%, MaxDB=33.2°C MWB=25.3°C
!
! Run Period (Weather File): Winter 1/14, Summer 7/7.
!
! Run Control:             Zone sizing required, No System sizing required (Run Control executes 2 design days)
!
! Building:                Single floor rectangular L-shaped building 40 ft south wall, 40 ft west wall, zone height 10 feet.
!                          There is a single 3 mm clear window in the West Zone south wall. The walls are 1 in stucco over 4 in
!                          common brick and 1 in dense insulation with gypboard on the interior. The roof is a built up roof with
!                          1/2 in stone over 3/8 in felt over 4 in dense insulation supported by 2 in heavy weight concrete. The
!                          floor is 8 in heavy weight concrete with carpeting. The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.07.
!                          Infiltration is fixed at 0.02 m3/s in East Zone in winter. A single thermal mass object was applied
!                          to the three thermal zones using ZoneList.
!
!                          The building is oriented due north.
