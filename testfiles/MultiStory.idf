! Basic file description:  9 Zones, 10 Story Building
! Highlights:
! This model illustrates the use of Zone Multipliers and Zone List Multipliers using the ZoneList and
! ZoneGroup objects.  This model simulates a large (10) multi-story building with 60 zones.  Since many of
! the zones are identical, all 60 zones can be simulated with only 9 unique zones in the input file.
!
! This model also illustrates the use of Site:WeatherStation, Site:HeightVariation, and OutdoorAir:Node
! objects with height-dependent atmospheric properties.
!
! The zones are organized into floors as follows:
!   Gnd Floor:       Gnd West Zone, Gnd Center Zone (x4), Gnd East Zone
!   Mid Floor (x8):  Mid West Zone, Mid Center Zone (x4), Mid East Zone
!   Top Floor:       Top West Zone, Top Center Zone (x4), Top East Zone
!
! Zone Multiplier field in the ZONE object is used to replicate center zones on the same floor.  The
! ZoneList object is used to define a list of zones.  The ZoneGroup object is used to organize zones
! into floors using the Zone List and the Zone List Multiplier fields.
!
! Window Multipliers are also used in the SURFACE:HEATTRANSFER:SUB object for East and West windows.
!
! TIPS FOR MULTI-STORY SIMULATIONS:
!   * If the basic zone geometry is identical, make one zone, copy & paste it as necessary, then change
!     the Zone Origin field to locate each zone correctly.
!   * Do not use interzone surfaces between zones that are multiplied.  Set the adjoining surfaces to
!     be adiabatic, i.e. use the OtherZoneSurface exterior boundary condition with the other surface
!     pointing back to itself.
!   * Locate the middle floor zones roughly halfway between top and ground because exterior convection
!     coefficients change with height.  Halfway should cause the differences to average out.
!   * This model only replicates zones in the East-West direction.  An additional "dimension" of zones
!     replicated in the North-South direction is possible but requires a total of 9 zones per floor for
!     a total of 27 zones in the input file.
!   * For all types of multipliers (Zone, Zone List, and Window) exterior shading of the multiplied
!     zones or windows must not be significantly different.  Otherwise it is best to simulate each
!     zone or window explicitly to accurately account for differences in solar gains.
