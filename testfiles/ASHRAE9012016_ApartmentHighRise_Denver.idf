! The 90.1 Prototype Building Models were developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL),
! under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  These building models were derived from
! DOEâ€™s Commercial Reference Building Models with modifications based on input from the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 committee,
! the Advanced Energy Design Guide series, and building industry experts.
! The prototypes models were developed to quantify energy saving impacts from
! newly published editions of ASHRAE Standard 90.1.  The basic building descriptions can be found in the Scorecards
! posted at this website.  Detailed descriptions of the prototype model development and addenda modeling
! strategies can be found in the following  reports:
! "Achieving 30% Goal: Energy and Cost Saving Analysis of ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2010."
! "Enhancements to ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Prototype Building Models"
! "Energy Savings Analysis: ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2016"
! "ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2013 Determination of Energy Savings: Quantitative Analysis"

! reset R value of semi-heated Roof to 0.001 if the R values goes below 0.001.  V4.0 has a 0.001 threshold with it.
!
! Revision 1.1  2010/01/20 21:49:30  d3l143
! Initial revision
!
! Note:
! January 20, 2010: We experienced a problem in upgrading Warehouse from V3.0 to V4.0.
!                   The R value of the semiheated roof goes to around 0.0002 for Miami and Ryihad which V4.0 compliants that it is below 0.001.
!                   This was not a problem for V3.0.  Here we implemented a temporal solution to re-set the r value to 0.001 when it is below it.

! Next two glazing layers are from IGDB double glazing database from Charlie Curcija (LBNL).
! The first layer is ID 3600, Neutral34gn5.grm. Followed by clear 3 mm glass.
! This double glazing has been added for 90.1-2016 to meet the sit-down restaurant
! SHGC requirement. Layers are used in construction Window_U_0.45_SHGC_0.27
