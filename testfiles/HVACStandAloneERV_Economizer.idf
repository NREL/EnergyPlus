! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 3 interior conditioned zones. Roof with no plenum.
!                          No ground contact with floor.
!
! Highlights:              Basic test of the stand alone energy recovery ventilator and its
!                          economizer (free cooling) controller. An example economizer schedule is also used
!                          between 7:00 am and 7:30 am to represent how a "push-button" type economizer may
!                          be used. Heat recovery is suspended when economizer schedule values are greater than 0.
!                          The west zone uses increased air flow for high humidity control where the
!                          outdoor air flow rate is increased when indoor relative humidity is above the humidistat
!                          set point and the outdoor air humidity ratio is lower than the indoor air humidity ratio.
!                          The north zone also shows the use of a stand alone ERV that does not use an ERV OA controller.
!
! Simulation Location/Run: Chicago Ohare Intl Ap IL USA WMO=725300, 2 design days, 2 run periods.
!                          Run Control executes the design days only.

!
! Run Period (Weather File): Winter 1/14, Summer 7/7.
!
! Run Control:             No Zone or System sizing required (design days only, see RUN CONTROL object)
!
! Building: Single floor rectangular L-shaped building 40 ft south wall, 40 ft west wall, zone height 10 feet.
!           There is a single window in the West zone south wall. The walls are 1 in stucco over 4 in common brick
!           and gypboard. The roof is a built up roof with 1/2 in stone over 3/8 in felt over 1 in dense insulation
!           supported by 2 in heavy weight concrete. The window is single pane 3mm clear.
!           The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.07.
!
!           The building is oriented due north.
