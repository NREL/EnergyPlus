!
! Highlights:              Example of using lookup tables as surrogate for performance curves.
!                          For each performance curve that is commented out, one or more table objects are used to represent
!                          that curve. The table objects have the same name as the performance curve with a 2 or 3
!                          appended to the end of the name to represent an alternate method of the table. These tables
!                          are used as performance curve inputs to other objects just as performance curves would be used.
!                          Search for "Table:" to find the first table object.

!           There is a single 3 mm clear window in the West zone south wall. The walls are 1 in stucco over 4 in
!           common brick and 1 in dense insulation with gypboard on the interior. The roof is a built up roof with
!           1/2 in stone over 3/8 in felt over 4 in dense insulation supported by 2 in heavy weight concrete. The
!           floor is 8 in heavy weight concrete with carpeting. The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.07.
!           Infiltration is fixed at 0.02 m3/s in East zone in winter.

!                                (West)   Air flow rate when compressor is off is either cooling or heating air flow
