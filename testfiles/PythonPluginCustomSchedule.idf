! Description:  Derived from DOE Commercial Building Benchmark, Small Office, new construction, Benchmark V 1.1_3.1
!               Single story, five zone office building.
! Form:         Area = 511 m2 (5,500 ft2); Number of Stories = 1; Shape = rectangle, Aspect ratio = 1.5
! Envelope:     Envelope thermal properties vary with climate according to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.
!               Opaque constructions: mass walls; attic roof; slab-on-grade floor
!               Windows: window-to-wall ratio = 19%, equal distribution of punched windows
!               Infiltration = 0.4 cfm/ft2 above grade wall area at 0.3 in wc (75 Pa) adjusted to 0.016 in wc (4 Pa).
!                              25% of full value when ventilation system on.
! HVAC:         PSZ-AC, gas furnace
!               No economizers, per ASHRAE 90.1-2004
!
! Int. gains:   lights = 10.76 W/m2 (1.0 W/ft2);
!               elec. plug loads = 8.07 W/m2 (0.75 W/ft2)
!               gas plug load = 0 W/m2 (0 W/ft2)
!               people = 28 total; 5.38/100 m2 (5.0/1000 ft2)
