! Building: Single floor rectangular L-shaped building 40 ft south wall, 40 ft west wall, zone height 10 feet.
!           There is a single window in West Zone's south wall. The walls are 1 in stucco over 4 in common brick
!           and gypboard. The roof is a built up roof with 1/2 in stone over 3/8 in felt over 1 in dense insulation
!           supported by 2 in heavy weight concrete. The window 3mm clear single pane. The storm window is identical.
!           The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.07.
!
!           The building is oriented due north.
