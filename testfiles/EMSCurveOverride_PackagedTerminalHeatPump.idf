!           There is a single 3 mm clear window in the West zone south wall. The walls are 1 in stucco over 4 in
!           common brick and 1 in dense insulation with gypboard on the interior. The roof is a built up roof with
!           1/2 in stone over 3/8 in felt over 4 in dense insulation supported by 2 in heavy weight concrete. The
!           floor is 8 in heavy weight concrete with carpeting. The window to wall ratio is approximately 0.07.
!           Infiltration is fixed at 0.02 m3/s in East zone in winter.

!                                (West)   Air flow rate when compressor is off is either cooling or heating air flow
!                                         during last compressor ON cycle since the fan continues to operate when the

!                                         Cooling and heating coils are scheduled on all year.
!                                         Thermostat uses dual set point.
!                                         The fan for this PTHP is also set up to model a multi-speed fan motor.
