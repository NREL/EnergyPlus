! Basic file description:  2-story 6-zone building with natural ventilation modeled by AirflowNetwork.
!
! Highlights:              Natural ventilation through openable exterior windows, openable interior doors, and
!                          a large horizontal opening between the first and second floor.
!
! Simulation Location/Run: CHICAGO_IL_USA TMY2-94846, 2 design days, 2 run periods,
!                          Run Control executes the design days only.
!
! Location:                Chicago, IL
!
! Design Days:             CHICAGO_IL_USA Annual Heating 99% Design Conditions DB, MaxDB= -17.3°C
!                          CHICAGO_IL_USA Annual Cooling 1% Design Conditions, MaxDB=  31.5°C MCWB=  23.0°C
!
! Run Period (Weather File): Winter 1/14, Summer 7/7, CHICAGO_IL_USA TMY2-94846
!
! Run Control:             No zone or system sizing, design day run control.
!
! Building:                Two story square building. The first story has three zones - a 40 ft x 20 ft
!                          NORTH_ZONE, with two smaller 20 ft x 20 ft zones in the southwest (WEST_ZONE) and
!                          southeast (EAST_ZONE). The NORTH_ZONE has a single 9.84 ft x 4.36 ft (3m x 1.33m)
!                          north-facing window. The WEST_ZONE has a single 13.12 ft x 4.96 ft (4m x 1.5m)
!                          south-facing window. There is a 3.28 ft x 6.56 ft (1m x 2m) door between the
!                          NORTH_ZONE and WEST_ZONE. All vertical surfaces are also modeled with cracks for
!                          uncontrolled infiltration. The second floor has the same floor plan as the first
!                          floor and has a and a flat roof with no plenum. There is a horizontal opening between
!                          NORTH_ZONE and NORTH_ZONE_T to allow a possible two-way airflow across the opening.
!                          The construction with a Material:InfraredTransparent material.

! Control logic:    The ventilation is temperature controlled. Window1 and DoorInSurface_3 in WEST_ZONE
!                   are opened when
!                     (1) the previous time step air temperature in WEST_ZONE is greater than the
!                         ventilation setpoint schedule value (a fixed value of 21.1C in this run), and
!                     (2) the previous time step air temperature in WEST_ZONE is greater than the
!                         outside air temperature.
!                   Similarly, Window2 in NORTH_ZONE is opened when the previous time step air
!                   temperature in NORTH_ZONE is greater than the ventilation setpoint schedule value
!                   and the previous time step air temperature in NORTH_ZONE is greater than the
!                   outside air temperature.
!
!                   Controls to modulate the ventilation openings are applied to the WEST_ZONE and
!                   the NORTH_ZONE (see the AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Zone inputs for these zones).
!
!                   The EAST_ZONE has no natural ventilation (Ventilation Control Mode = NoVent in
!                   the AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Zone input for this zone).
!
!                   In addition to natural ventilation in two of the zones, there are cracks in all
!                   exterior and interior walls. Cracks in the exterior walls allow infiltration of
!                   outside air into the zones.  The interior doorway and cracks in the interior walls
!                   allow cross-mixing of air between zones (i.e., interzone air flow). There are no
!                   cracks in the roof surfaces.
!
!                   The above decription provide information on control logic in the first floor. The control
!                   logic in the same floor is the same as the first floor. However, there is a large horizontal
!                   opening between  NORTH_ZONE and NORTH_ZONE_T with constant ventilation control mode.
