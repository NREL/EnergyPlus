! Refrigeration load is highly dependent upon infiltration rates (ACH).  Air chillers
!     and refrigeration systems oversized to allow possible increase above rates used here.
!     An effective Air Barrier System has been assumed in selecting the rates modeled here.
!     A common InfiltrationSchedule has been used for all zones with adjustments for
!     likely use made using the ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate objects.
! Door openings are modeled linking Freezer1 with Subfreezer and
!                                   Freezer5 with both Cooler2 and Cooler3
!
! Internal loads associated with lighting and electrical equipment have also been modeled.
! A large number of refrigerating air coils have been modeled to allow for diversified
!     defrost schedules.  This diversity, along with the internal mass, is necessary
!     to maintain the desired temperature control.
! Internal Mass has been used to represent the warehouse contents. This correctly
!     reflects the thermal inertia of the contents, but does not mimic radiative
!     interactions between the contents and the warehouse shell. Because of the large
!     amount of internal mass, the warm-up required is longer than for some other
!     simulations.

! Subfreezer
! -25C is desired zone temperature
! max sensible load was 136,000W with ideal air (no latent included)
! avg cap was 77,000W with ideal air (no latent included)
! Try with 300,000W total and DT1 of 8C, so unit load factor is 40,000 W/DeltaC
! See BAC AS5S-4084-050L, fan 0.5 HP (0.5 hp = 373 W), airflow 26,250 cfm(1 ft3 = 0.02833 m3, so ~12.4 m3/s),
!                     frosted capacity 20,650 B/h-F (~10,900 W/C), so need 3 of them
!  Will do Evap T of -33C, let heater = 200W,
!  Use electric defrost - capacity large to limit time and handle latent load
!  Electric defrost capacity, BAC recommends 11 W/ft2 (this model has 5,006 ft2), so 55066W

! Remaining chillers for Freezer_1 zone.
! -18C is desired zone temperature
! max sensible load was 1,082,000W with ideal air (no latent included)
! avg cap was 386,000W with ideal air (no latent included)
! Try with 1,200,000W total and DT1 of 8C, so unit load factor is 150,000 W/DeltaC
! See BAC AS5S-4084-050L, fan 0.5 HP (0.5 hp = 373 W), airflow 26,250 cfm(1 ft3 = 0.02833 m3, so ~12.4 m3/s),
!                     frosted capacity 20,650 B/h-F (~10,900 W/C), so need 13 of them (got by with 12)
!  Will do Evap T of -26C, let heater = 200W,
!  Use electric defrost - capacity large to limit time and handle latent load
!  Electric defrost capacity, BAC recommends 11 W/ft2 (this model has 5,006 ft2), so 55066W
!  AirChiller_5 uses a hot fluid defrost with temperature termination

! Cooler_1
! 4C is desired zone temperature
! max sensible load was 772,000W with ideal air (no latent included)
! Target 1.2(max) total sensible cooling capacity and DT1 of 8C
!    so unit load factor is 116,000 W/DeltaC
!    See BAC AL2s-63104, fan 7.5 HP (5595 W), airflow 51,000 cfm(24 m3/s),
!    frosted capacity 38,300 B/h-F (20,200 W/C), so need 6 of them
!  Will do Evap T of -4C, let heater = 200W,
!  Use electric defrost - capacity large to limit time and handle latent load
!  Electric defrost capacity, BAC recommends 11 W/ft2 (this model has 6,018 ft2), so 66200W
!  But that defrost capacity prooved insufficient, with excessive frost
!  accumulation -  increase defrost power to 150,000 and change schedule
