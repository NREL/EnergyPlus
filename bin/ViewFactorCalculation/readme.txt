There are four parts in the view factor calculation package.  

View3D.exe is the NIST view factor calculation program.
View3D32.pdf is the documentation for the program that NIST supplied.
ViewFactorInterface.xls is an Excel workbook that provices an 
       interface for View3D.exe.  
Instructions for using the View Factor Calculation Interface are
       contained in the Auxiliary Programs Document

Some notes:

1.  Read the Auxiliary Programs instructions first.  
2.  The interface has macros. They are necessary. 
3.  Some of the documentation in View3D32.pdf is not consistent 
      and does not agree with the program,    
      but to utilize some of the advanced features of the program, 
      it has to be used.
