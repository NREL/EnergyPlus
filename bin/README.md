I was hoping there would be no binaries in the main repo.  But alas, there are some here.  Hopefully over time, these tools can be either replaced with something that we can compile from source on CI, or the CI system can be upgraded to automatically build them.  This folder contains binary blobs generated from VB6, RealBasic, and Fortran that is too old to compile on anything but Intel (EPMacro).
