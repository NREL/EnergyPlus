                EnergyPlus is a simulation program designed for modeling buildings with all their associated
                heating, cooling, lighting, ventilating, and other energy flows. EnergyPlus is a stand-alone simulation
                engine
                without a ‘user friendly’ graphical interface. EnergyPlus reads input and writes output as text files,
                although as of 9.3, EnergyPlus became a library.

    <h2>Using EnergyPlus</h2>
    <p>
        Utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input files that come with EnergyPlus include IDF Editor
        and EP-Launch. Many graphical user interfaces for EnergyPlus are available or under development. For the latest
        tools, please see
        <a href="https://www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com/?capabilities=Whole-building+Energy+Simulation&keywords=EnergyPlus">
            this website for third party interfaces</a>. A completely new cross-platform version of EP-Launch has been
        developed and is available separate from the EnergyPlus install; see the <a
            href="https://ep-launch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#ep-launch">documentation</a> for more
        information. Some tools may produce out of date IDF files; you can then use the IDFVersionUpdater program to
        convert older files to current EnergyPlus version (you may need to use the Multiple Version Conversions
        set – see below).
    </p>

    <h2>* Python Ecosystem *</h2>
    <p>
        While EnergyPlus will continue to provide users with current workflows and installation methods, we are pushing
        toward a more flexible EnergyPlus that behaves like a standard Python library.  An upcoming version will allow
        users to pip install energyplus, which will bring down the EnergyPlus native libraries plus the Python API
        bindings, ready to be used by the user's desired Python environment.  This should make setting up EnergyPlus
        much easier for many use cases!

                        For a majority of users, EnergyPlus is still
                        basically the same tool, but with some great new features, bug fixes, and runtime performance
                        improvements. Running EnergyPlus can still be accomplished the same way, by creating an input
                        file in IDF or EpJSON syntax, running the EnergyPlus(.exe) binary, and gathering results of
                        interest. All this power is still available. &#128077; <br>
                        As of EnergyPlus 9.3, EnergyPlus started becoming a bit more flexible thanks to the addition of
                        a formal C API with Python Bindings, as well as the ability to execute user-defined Python
                        "plugins" in lieu of writing user-defined Erl code. In the library mode, a
                        client can make function calls to setup and execute a simulation, as well as interact with
                        simulation results <b>during</b> a simulation. &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
                        A key effort completed with 9.5 was making EnergyPlus "thread-safe" by removing all global and
                        static data from the program. Now each running thread of EnergyPlus has a complete simulation
                        state, and no data is shared, so multiple runs can happen within a single process, opening the
                        door for interesting new workflows and applications. <br>

    <h2><a id="Multiple_Version_Conversions_51"></a>Multiple Version Conversions</h2>
    <p>
        The install includes the IDFVersionUpdater program and the necessary programs to convert from the previous
        version (including .rvi and .mvi files) to the current version. The install also includes the necessary programs
        to convert from older versions back to v9.0.0. For versions older than that, first we applaud your dedication
        to EnergyPlus that stretches for quite some time, and second you will need to visit the
        <a href="https://energyplushelp.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/67000241428">Helpdesk</a> to request
        multiple conversion set of programs.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="Documentation_55"></a>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
        The EnergyPlus documentation is included in pdf form in the installer. The pdfs are also available <a
            href="https://energyplus.net/documentation">online</a>. For <strong>new users</strong> of EnergyPlus, a
        guide called the EnergyPlus Essentials was developed and is available with the installed pdf documentation.
        Big Ladder Software is also hosting html versions of the
        EnergyPlus Documentation <a href="http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/">online</a>.
    </p>
    <p>There are some other documents of interest available on the EnergyPlus web site including:</p>
    <div class="list-group">

    <p>
        In addition, we are working to make our API documentation dynamic and hosted on ReadTheDocs. The
        <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/blob/develop/README.md">README</a> on our Github Repo will be kept
        up to date with links to our documentation sources as we get things settled there.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="Weather_Data_63"></a>Weather Data</h2>
    <p>A small subset of weather files that are available on the web site are also installed in the WeatherData folder.
        EnergyPlus uses these files directly for annual simulations. The Weather Converter program that is part of
        EnergyPlus can read these weather files and provide .csv (comma separated variable) as well as statistics
        reports
        about the included (or other) files. Weather data for more than 3000 locations in more than 100 countries can be
        downloaded on the <a href="https://energyplus.net/weather">EnergyPlus Weather Page</a>.</p>

        We test and develop on Windows 10 and 11, and currently produce 32 and 64 bit builds on Windows.  The 32-bit
        build is likely to be removed at some point soon.  For Linux, we provide packages for
        Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04.  This release also includes an Ubuntu 18.04 build, but moving forward we will be
        eliminating that.  On Mac, we are releasing an installer for OSX 10.15, 11, and 12, but the 10.15 will be
        eliminated soon.

    <h2><a id="Known_problems_104"></a>Known problems</h2>
    <p>While every effort has been made to clean up all the “defects” that have occurred during our testing, quite a few
        known (and even more unknown) probably remain. Specifics on the remaining known problems can be found on the
        GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues">issues page</a>. If you are interested in
        what has been addressed, the issues resolved in this release are installed similarly in the
        <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/latest">release details</a>.
