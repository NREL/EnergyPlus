Version 8.7.0<br>
31 March 2017<br>
<em>EnergyPlus is a trademark of the US Department of Energy.</em></p>
<h1><a id="EnergyPlus_8"></a>EnergyPlus</h1>
<h2><a id="What_it_is_What_it_is_not_10"></a>What it is, What it is not</h2>
<p>EnergyPlus is a simulation program designed for modeling buildings with all their associated heating, cooling, lighting, ventilating, and other energy flows. EnergyPlus is a stand-alone simulation engine without a ‘user friendly’ graphical interface . . . EnergyPlus reads input and writes output as text files.</p>
<p>Utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input files that come with EnergyPlus include IDF Editor and EP-Launch. Many graphical user interfaces for EnergyPlus are available or under development. For the latest tools, please see <a href="https://energyplus.net/interfaces">this EnergyPlus website for third party interfaces</a>.</p>
<p>A number of third-party tools are available to create EnergyPlus input files (IDF). For the latest tools, please see <a href="https://energyplus.net/input-files">this EnergyPlus website for third party IDF creation tools</a>. Some of these may produce out of date IDF files; you can then use the IDFVersionUpdater program to convert older files to current EnergyPlus version (you may need to use the Multiple Version Conversions set – see below.</p>
<h2><a id="Whats_going_on_in_V86_18"></a>What’s going on in V8.7?</h2>
<p>Will there be any considerable difference between version 8.6 and 8.7?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes… and no. The basic structure of EnergyPlus is still as it has been but there are some significant changes that you will want to be aware of. As always, there are a number of new features and bug fixes. The highlights of features for this version are listed below—see <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/latest">EnergyPlus Features Page</a> for a complete list of new features added in this and previous versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a few key changes in the V8.7 IDD. For best results, use the transition program to transfer from the earlier V8.6 files. Use the IDFVersionUpdater program for best results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is version 8.7 backward compatible? Can I run v8.6 file in v8.7?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There have been changes in the following objects which require conversion. Either read and follow the Rules spreadsheet or use the IDFVersionUpdater utility. The “Rules” spreadsheet that contains information on exact object changes that you can do by hand. The updater program is described more fully in the Auxiliary Programs document. For the v8.7 release, the following objects require conversion (from V8.6):</p>
<ul>
<li>Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed</li>
<li>Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed</li>
<li>CoolingTower:SingleSpeed</li>
<li>CoolingTower:TwoSpeed</li>
<li>CoolingTower:VariableSpeed:Merkel</li>
<li>AirflowNetwork:SimlationControl</li>
<li>ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier:ResearchSpecial</li>
<li>WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, as happens in every EnergyPlus release, there are new checks on user input. Even if your file ran in an earlier version, it may not run in the newer version after conversion due to newer checks on the validity of input.</p>
<h2><a id="Multiple_Version_Conversions_51"></a>Multiple Version Conversions</h2>
<p>The install includes the IDFVersionUpdater program and the necessary programs to convert from the previous version (including .rvi and .mvi files) to the current version. For older versions, you will need to visit the helpdesk and download the multiple conversion set of programs. The HelpDesk downloads area: <a href="http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/46/converting-older-version-files">Converting Older Files</a> will contain the necessary readmes and zip/tar files of programs to convert IDFs from V1.0 to the current version.</p>
<h2><a id="Documentation_55"></a>Documentation</h2>
<p>The EnergyPlus documentation is included in pdf form in the installer. The pdfs are also available <a href="https://energyplus.net/documentation">online</a>. Big Ladder Software is also hosting html versions of the EnergyPlus Documentation <a href="http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/">online</a></p>
<p>There are some other documents of interest available on the web site including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing and Validation Reports: <a href="https://energyplus.net/testing">EnergyPlus Testing and Validation Reports</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Weather_Data_63"></a>Weather Data</h2>
<p>A small subset of weather files that are available on the web site are also installed in the WeatherData folder. EnergyPlus uses these files directly for annual simulations. The Weather Converter program that is part of EnergyPlus can read these weather files and provide .csv (comma separated variable) as well as statistics reports about the included (or other) files.  Weather data for more than 2100 locations in more than 100 countries can be downloaded on the <a href="https://energyplus.net/weather">EnergyPlus Weather Page</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="Installation_contents_100"></a>Installation contents</h2>
<p>The installation creates a program folder with icons/shortcuts for the programs/files in EnergyPlus that can be accessed from Windows menus, including removing EnergyPlus from your system. In Windows OS, these will be available from the “Programs” area in the Start Menu. Note that only a few of the programs will store anything in your Windows\System directory (IDFEditor, EPLaunch, WeatherConverter).</p>
<h2><a id="Known_problems_104"></a>Known problems</h2>
<p>While every effort has been made to clean up all the “defects” that have occurred during our testing, quite a few known (and even more unknown) probably remain. Specifics on the remaining known problems can be found on the GitHub repository <a href="github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues">issues page</a>. If you are interested in what has been addressed, the issues resolved in this release are installed similarly in the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.</p>
