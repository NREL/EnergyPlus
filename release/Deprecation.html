    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        As EnergyPlus evolves, features and capabilities are added to ensure the tool keeps up with demand.
        However, some features and capabilities may grow outdated and potentially be removed from the tool.
        For most changes to EnergyPlus between versions, an automated conversion is possible.
        When an automatic conversion is not possible, the relevant input objects are marked as deprecated,
        a warning message is emitted from the simulation engine, and eventually the user must manually
        convert the file once the feature is fully removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The justification for removing capabilities is to reduce the maintenance burden of the program, allowing more
        effort to be placed in adding newer, more vital, capabilities, and also to streamline the internal structure of
        the program to improve the runtime burden of the program.
    </p>
    <p>
        This document discusses those aspects which are on the roadmap for deprecation from the engine.
        The full deprecation process consists of several steps to ensure that users are not suddenly impacted
        by the change. This document will be included in each installer and also sent to major stakeholders and users.
    </p>

    <h2>Deprecation Process</h2>
    <p>
        The deprecation process consists of a number of steps.  The deprecation process will gnerally follow each of
        these steps one release at a time.  However, the development reserves the right to alter the deprecation
        timeline of features as needed.
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Level 1 - Gathering Feedback</dt>
        <dd>
            In this first phase of the process we will list items in this deprecation document, with the hopes of
            hearing back from users about the potential deprecation. EnergyPlus does not have a way to feed back
            information to the development team about how frequently objects are being used, so this step is all about
            gathering feedback. Objects are not yet marked as deprecated at this stage.
        </dd>
        <dt>Level 2 - Deprecation</dt>
        <dd>
            If a release cycle is completed, and a capability is still planned for deprecation, then the relevant input
            objects will be marked with a deprecation tag, and the object will be marked as Level 2 in this document.
        </dd>
        <dt>Level 3 - Removal</dt>
        <dd>
            If an additional release cycle completes and the object is still marked for deprecation, the capability will
            then be removed from EnergyPlus, and any input objects will be removed from the input schema.  Warning
            messages will be emitted into the version translator to alert the user that the capability was removed.
            Deprecated objects will be placed into the level 3 section of this document.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Level 1 Deprecation Status</h2>

    <h3>Future Version Numbers</h3>
    <p>
        This is not exactly an input object or capability deprecation, but it is a major change in the version numbers.
        EnergyPlus has historically used version numbers that varied the major number and sometimes the minor
        number. For the last several years we have just incremented the minor number. Since
        EnergyPlus input files have some breaking changes in each release, the minor number change does not hold a
        lot of meaning. We have decided to move forward with a more modern version numbering scheme starting next year.
        The EnergyPlus version will be based on the year and the release number. The March 2022 release is expected to
        be EnergyPlus 2022.1 and the Fall release will be EnergyPlus 2022.2. If additional major releases are created
        for some reason, they would increment the release number further. Rare intermediate releases may be numbered
        with a patch number such as 2022.1.1.
    </p>

    <h3>DElight</h3>
    <p>
        DElight daylighting capabilities provides an alternative to the split-flux method.  The DElight library has not
        been updated in several years, and there is little user activity (support questions, etc.) related to this
        feature.  This library is considered for potential deprecation.
    </p>

    <h3>Component Costs</h3>
    <p>
        EnergyPlus, as a physics calculation engine, does include some extra "non-physics" calculations.  Component cost
        is one calculation that can be performed fully outside EnergyPlus, unrelated to the direct physics of the
        simulation.  The ComponentCost objects are considered for potential deprecation.
    </p>

    <h3>Geometry Transformation</h3>
    <p>
        Geometry transformation allows for users to enter inputs that transform the building inside the simulation
        itself.  It has been suggested that this capability should live outside of EnergyPlus, so objects related to
        this capability are now considered potentially deprecated.
    </p>

    <h2>Level 2 Deprecation Status</h2>
    <p>
        At this time, no objects have advanced to level 2 deprecation status.
    </p>

    <h2>Level 3 Deprecation Status</h2>
    <p>
        At this time, no objects have advanced to level 3 (full removal) yet.
