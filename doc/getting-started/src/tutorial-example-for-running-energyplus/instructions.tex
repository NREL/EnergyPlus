\subsection{Exercise 1A. Run Pre-Defined Building with no Windows}\label{exercise-1a.-run-pre-defined-building-with-no-windows}

Objective:~ Learn to use EP-Launch to run an EnergyPlus input file and view output files.

1.~Open EP-Launch.

2.~Under ``Input File'', browse for input file Exercise1A.idf.~ This input file contains the 1-zone model described above without the windows and lights. This is located under the install folder \textless{}root\textgreater{}\textbackslash{}ExampleFiles\textbackslash{}BasicsFiles,

3.~Under ``Weather File'', select ``No Weather File'' (at the top of the pull-down list).

4.~Press ``Simulate''.

5.~When the simulation is complete, review output files:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Press ``Text Output Files'' to see all text output.~ Look especially at the eio and err output files.
\item
  Press ``Drawing Files'' to see a dxf drawing of the building envelope.~ (If using Voloview Express, right-click to switch between wireframe and shaded orbit view.~ In DWG True View, use ``View'' -\textgreater{} ``Visual Styles'' to switch between wireframe and solid views. In both programs, use ``View'' Ã ``Named Views'' to select isometric views.)
\item
  An empty svg drawing file will also open (this will show HVAC system components in later exercises).~ Note that the Adobe SVG viewer is a ``plug-in'' for Internet Explorer (IE), so IE will open when viewing an SVG file.~ Depending on the security settings in IE, you may be prompted with a warning about ``active'' content.
\item
  Press ``Spreadsheets'' to open the numeric csv output files.~ In Exercise1a.csv, review the pattern of outdoor conditions and loads.~ (To make it easier to read the column headings, select Row 1, format cells, and turn on wrap text; then select cell B2 and select ``freeze panes''.) ~In Exercise1aMeter.csv, review the facility district heating and cooling meters.
\item
  Zone/Sys Air Temperature -- the zone air temperatures are already being reported.
\item
  Outdoor Dry Bulb -- is being reported (so you can compare to outside temperature)
\item
  The meter for the heating in the facility - DistrictHeating:Facility -- is being reported. Facility is the entire building.
\item
  The meter for the cooling in the facility - DistrictCooling:Facility -- is being reported.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exercise 1B. Add Windows}\label{exercise-1b.-add-windows}

Objective:~ Learn how to add materials, constructions, and a surface using 3-D coordinates.

1.~In EP-Launch, with input file Exercise1A.idf still selected, press ``Edit -- IDF Editor''.~ This will open Exercise1A.idf in the IDF Editor, a tool that assists in editing EnergyPlus input files (idf).

2.~In IDF Editor, select File -\textgreater{} Save Options . . . and set ``Saved Order'' to ``Original with New at Top'', and ``Special Format for Some Objects'' to ``Yes.''~ Check the ``Set as Default'' box.

3.~In IDF Editor, Select File -\textgreater{} Save As . . . and save this file as Exercise1B.idf.

4.~Create the construction definition for the windows which are double-pane clear gas with an air space:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Using File -\textgreater{} Open Dataset, open the window glass materials dataset file, WindowGlassMaterials.idf
\item
  Scroll down the Class list and select ``\textbf{WindowMaterial:Glazing}''.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
-Hint:  In IDF Editor, View -> Show Classes with Objects Only (or ctl-L) will hide all empty object types from the class list.
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Locate the object which defines the material properties for ``CLEAR 6MM''.~ Select this object (by clicking on the column heading).
\item
  Using Edit -\textgreater{} Copy Object (or the toolbar button, or ctl-C), copy this object.
\item
  Switch windows to file Exercise1B.idf and paste the window material into this file.~ (Verify that is had been added by going to \textbf{WindowMaterial:Glazing} to view the object.)
\item
  Open dataset file WindowGasMaterials.idf.
\item
  Locate ``AIR 3MM'', copy it and paste it into Exercise1B.idf.
\item
  In Exercise1B.idf, select the ``\textbf{Construction}'' class.~ There are three constructions pre-defined for the walls, roof, and floor.
\item
  Press ``New Obj'' to create a new blank \textbf{Construction} object.
\item
  Name this new construction ``DOUBLE PANE WINDOW''.
\item
  Use the pulldown list to select ``CLEAR 6MM'' for the outside layer, then press ``Enter'' or ``Return'' to save this entry and move to the next field.
\item
  Select ``AIR 3MM'' for Layer 2, and ``CLEAR 6MM'' for Layer 3.
\end{itemize}

5.~Add the east window (3m wide by 2m high, centered on wall, \emph{see the drawing in} \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-for-exercise-1}} \emph{to determine coordinates):}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Select ``\textbf{FenestrationSurface:Detailed}'' class.
\item
  Add a new object named ``EAST WINDOW''.
\item
  Set the remaining fields as listed:
\item
  Surface Type \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{} = Window
\item
  Construction Name \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{} = DOUBLE PANE WINDOW
\item
  Base Surface Name \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{} = ZONE SURFACE EAST
\item
  OutsideFaceEnvironment Object \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}. = \textless{}blank\textgreater{}
\item
  View Factor to Ground \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}.. = autocalculate
\item
  Name of shading control \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{} = \textless{}blank\textgreater{}
\item
  WindowFrameAndDivider Name \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}.. = \textless{}blank\textgreater{}
\item
  Multiplier \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}. = 1
\item
  Number of Surface Vertex Groups \ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{} = 4
\item
  Vertex coordinates = \emph{as determined from the drawing} \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-for-exercise-1}}.~ Coordinates in this input are in World Coordinates (all relative to the global origin of 0,0,0).~ Coordinates are specified as viewed from the outside of the surface, using the rules specified in the SurfaceGeometry object.
\end{itemize}

6.~Add the west window, similar to the east window.

7.~Add a new \textbf{Output:Surfaces:List} object, type = Details.~ This report produces a list of all surfaces in the eio output summarizing area, azimuth, tilt, etc.

8.~Save and close the IDF file, select Exercise1B.idf in EP-Launch, run the simulation and view outputs.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Always review the err file for errors and warnings.~ Fix problems if needed and re-run.
\item
  Are the windows in the right place in the dxf drawing file. (Use the Drawing File button or select the DXF file from View -\textgreater{} Single File or from the Quick-Open panel).
\item
  Review the surface details report in the eio file, search for ``Zone/Shading Surfaces'' to find this report. (Use the Text Output button, Quick Open ``eio'' button, or select from the single file menu, or use F7).~ This report is easier to read by pasting this section into a spreadsheet and using the text to columns function with comma as a delimiter).
\item
  Open the csv output file and compare the heating and cooling loads with the results from Exercise1A.csv.
\end{itemize}
