\subsection{Exercise 2A. Add Unitary System with DX Cooling and Gas Heating (Furnace) Serving a Single Zone}\label{exercise-2a.-add-unitary-system-with-dx-cooling-and-gas-heating-furnace-serving-a-single-zone}

Objective:~ Learn how to describe a thermostat and unitary equipment using HVACTemplate objects.

1)~~~Open Exercise2.idf and save it as Exercise2A.idf.~ (Exercise2.idf contains the building envelope, internal loads, and some extra schedules to support the HVAC system descriptions which will be added in this Exercise.)

2)~~~Add a \textbf{HVACTemplate:Thermostat} object to define the thermostat setpoints for this simulation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Choose a name for the thermostat.~ This name will be referenced in the next step.
\item
  For heating setpoints, use pre-defined schedule named ``Office Heating Setpoints''.
\item
  For cooling setpoints, use pre-defined schedule named ``Office Cooling Setpoints''.
\end{itemize}

3)~~~Add a \textbf{HVACTemplate:Zone:Unitary} object serving the ``NORTH PERIMETER'' zone.~ Choose a name for the air handling system which will be added in Step 4. Use the thermostat name from step 2 for the thermostat field. Retain the defaults for the remaining fields.

4)~~~Add a \textbf{HVACTemplate:System:Unitary} object.~ The name of this system object must be the same name used in the zone object for ``Air Handling System Name'' field (See Step 3).~ Retain the defaults for all fields except the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Availability Schedule = Office HVAC (predefined)
\item
  Control Zone Name or Thermostat Location = NORTH PERIMETER
\item
  Supply Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name = Continuous
\item
  Heating Coil Type = Gas
\item
  Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name = Office Minimum OA (predefined)
\end{itemize}

5)~~~Add a \textbf{Sizing:Parameters} object and set the sizing factor to 1.2 (for 20\% oversizing).

6)~~~Edit the \textbf{SimulationControl} object and set the Zone and System sizing flags to ``Yes''.

7)~~~Run the simulation and review output files, especially:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  err, there will be some warnings about meters that do no exist and the ABUPS report not being a full year.~ These will go away as more features are added and an annual run is simulated.
\item
  DXF , drawing of building surfaces.~ (Try selecting the Southwest Isometric named view, then see how each zone is a separate drawing layer.~ In Voloview open the View -\textgreater{} Layers dialog.~ Click on the light bulbs to toggle display of each zone.~ In TrueView click on the Layer Properties Manager toolbar button.~ To toggle display of a layer, single-click a layer light bulb, then click apply.)
\item
  SVG, block diagram of the HVAC system components. (HINT: right-click in the drawing and read the Help to learn how to navigate in the SVG viewer.)
\item
  Main Results File (csv) and Meter File (Meter.csv).
\item
  eio, zone and system sizing results
\item
  Add output variables to report operation of the system (furnace) fan, heating coil, and cooling coil.~ Reference the RDD output file for variable names.
\end{itemize}

8)~~~Re-run the simulation and review results again.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note during hour 7 of the summer design day that ``NORTH PERIMETER:Zone/Sys Sensible Heating Rate\href{Hourly}{W}'' is nonzero, but the heating coil is off and the DX cooling coil shows a load.~ Why?~ This report variable reports the impact of the system on the zone (not the zone's demand for heating or cooling), averaged over the hour.~ The system fan is scheduled on at 6 a.m., but the outside air dampers are closed.~ The zone is not warm enough from the night to require cooling, so the circulating fan heat warms the zone slightly for a portion of the hour until the zone temperature exceeds the cooling setpoint and the DX coil comes on for the remainder of the hour.~ If the economizer were active, this would not occur.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exercise 2B. Add VAV System with Reheat Serving Four Zones with Chiller and Boiler Plant}\label{exercise-2b.-add-vav-system-with-reheat-serving-four-zones-with-chiller-and-boiler-plant}

Objective:~ Learn how to describe a VAV system with central plant using HVACTemplate objects.

1)~~~Save Exercise2A.idf as Exercise2B.idf.

2)~~~Add a \textbf{HVACTemplate:System:VAV} object.~ Retain the defaults for all fields except the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Air Handling System Name = \textless{}assign a name\textgreater{}
\item
  System Availability Schedule = Office HVAC (predefined)
\item
  Cooling Coil Design Setpoint = 13C (55.4F)
\item
  Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name = Office Minimum OA (predefined)
\item
  Economizer Type = FixedDryBulb
\item
  Return Plenum Name = PLENUM
\end{itemize}

3)~~~Add four \textbf{HVACTemplate:Zone:VAV} objects serving the four remaining zones (South Perimeter, East Perimeter, West Perimeter, and Core).~ Retain the defaults for all fields except the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Specify the same air handler name added in Step 2 (use the dropdown list)
\item
  Specify the same thermostat control added in Exercise 2A Step 2 (again, use the dropdown list).
\item
  Supply Air Minimum Flow Fraction = 0.2
\item
  Reheat Coil Type = Hot Water
\item
  Heating Damper Action = Reverse
\item
  HINT:~ Define one \textbf{HVACTemplate:Zone:VAV} object, make the above changes to defaults, then press ``Dup Obj'' three times to duplicate the object, then edit the remaining three zone names.
\end{itemize}

4)~~~Add a \textbf{HVACTemplate:Plant:ChilledWaterLoop} object and assign a name.~~~ Retain the defaults for all fields except the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Condenser Water Temperature Control Type = Specified Setpoint
\end{itemize}

5)~~~Add a \textbf{HVACTemplate:Plant:Chiller} object, type Electric Reciprocating Chiller with a nominal COP of 3.6, water cooled.

6)~~~Add a \textbf{HVACTemplate:Plant:Tower} object, type Two Speed.

7)~~~Add a \textbf{HVACTemplate:Plant:HotWaterLoop} object and assign a name.~ Retain the defaults for all fields.

8)~~~Add a natural gas fired hot water boiler using \textbf{HVACTemplate:Plant:Boiler}.

9)~~~Run the simulation, add desired report variables, and re-run the simulation.~ Review results and compare with results from Exercise 2A:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Note how the heating and cooling rates for the NORTH PERIMETER zone are smaller than before.~ Why?
\item
  Review the SVG drawing to see the components of the VAV system and water loops.
\item
  Browse the expidf file in a text editor (or open in IDF Editor from File, Open, setting file type to expidf) to see the full detailed description of the HVAC systems using native EnergyPlus objects (the expanded result of the HVACTemplate preprocessor).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exercise 2C. Annual Simulation}\label{exercise-2c.-annual-simulation}

Objective:~ Learn how to schedule report variables and create a monthly table report.

1)~~~Save Exercise2B.idf as Exercise2C.idf.

2)~~~Edit the \textbf{SimulationControl} object to turn off the design day simulations by setting ``Run Simulation for Sizing Periods'' to \textbf{No} and turn on the weather file (annual) simulation by setting ``Run Simulation for Weather File Run Periods'' to \textbf{Yes}..

3)~~~Edit existing \textbf{Output:Variable} and \textbf{Output:Meter} objects and change the reporting frequency from Hourly to Monthly.

4)~~~Locate the \textbf{Output:Variable} object for ``Zone/Sys Air Temp'' and duplicate it.~ Edit the new object and add a schedule ``Office Occupancy 2''.~ This object will report zone temperatures averaged only during occupied periods (when ``Office Occupancy 2'' is greater than zero).~ The original instance of this report variable will average the zone temperatures over all hours.

5)~~~Add a new \textbf{Output:Table:Monthly} object:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Name = Zone Temperature Report
\item
  Open the rdd output file for Exercise2B in the text editor and find the following report variable names to copy and paste into the fields of the Report:Table:Monthly object in IDF Editor.~ Variable name and aggregation type are listed in pairs.
\item
  Zone Mean Air Temperature, SumOrAverage
\item
  Zone Mean Air Temperature, Maximum
\item
  Zone Mean Air Temperature, Minimum
\item
  Zone People Number of Occupants, HoursPositive
\item
  Zone Mean Air Temperature, SumOrAverageDuringHoursShown
\item
  Zone Mean Air Temperature, MaximumDuringHoursShown
\item
  Zone Mean Air Temperature, MinimumDuringHoursShown
\end{itemize}

6)~~~Edit \textbf{Output:Table:SummaryReports} to add the ``Equipment Summary'' report.

7)~~~Select Chicago TMY2 weather file and run the simulation.

8)~~~Review outputs.~ (Note the ABUPS report in the HTML file will now show a full year of results.)~ Especially review the Zone Temperatures table report in the HTML file.~ There will be a warning regarding \textbf{Output:Table:Monthly}, because there are no people in the PLENUM zone; this is normal.
