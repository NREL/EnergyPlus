\section{HVACTemplate Objects}\label{hvactemplate-objects}

HVAC Template objects are available. These are intended to allow for several ``usual'' HVAC types to be expanded into EnergyPlus HVAC inputs with minimal user entries. These are described in the ``Input/Output Reference'' document under the Group ``HVACTemplates'' and the expansion process is described in the Auxiliary Programs document under ``ExpandObjects''.
