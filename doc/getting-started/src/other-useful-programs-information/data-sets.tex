\section{Data Sets}\label{data-sets}

EnergyPlus uses snippets of IDF files to create the library of data that may be useful for you. Two folders are created upon installation: DataSets -- which contains IDF snippets and MacroDataSets -- which also contain IDF snippets but are in a form such that they can be easily used with the EPMacro program.
