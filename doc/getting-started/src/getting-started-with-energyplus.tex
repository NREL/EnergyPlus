\chapter{Getting Started with EnergyPlus}\label{getting-started-with-energyplus}

The remainder of this document is intended to give you a start on using the program with a few simple tools (EP-Launch to help run the simulation; IDFEditor to help create or look at input files) as well as some of the features (such as energy meters, simulation results) of using the program.

For learning about a specific input file, or a specific input object, the install includes two documents in the ExampleFiles folder:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Example Files Summary (highlights of each example file)
\item
  Example Files Links to Objects (for any object, up to 3 files using that object are shown)
\end{itemize}

The standard Windows install procedure has put the following information on your computer, in the directories/folders shown.

The main EnergyPlus folder contains: * Energy+.idd * EnergyPlus.exe and dependent shared libraries (dll files) * RunEPlus.bat and other batch files for running EnergyPlus * readme file(s), license, etc. * EP-Macro.exe and other support binaries * bugreprt.txt~

The general layout of folders from the install looks like:
