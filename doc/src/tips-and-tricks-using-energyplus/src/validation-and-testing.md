# Validation and Testing

An important ongoing part of EnergyPlus development is testing using industry standard methods as major builds are completed. The goal is to make EnergyPlus as bug-free as possible. Three major types of tests are currently conducted:

- Analytical tests:

- HVAC tests, based on ASHRAE Research Project 865
- Building fabric tests, based on ASHRAE Research Project 1052

- Comparative tests:

- ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140-2007
- International Energy Agency Solar Heating and Cooling Programme (IEA SHC) BESTest (Building Energy Simulation Test) methods not yet in Standard 140
- EnergyPlus HVAC Component Comparative tests
- EnergyPlus Global Heat Balance tests

- Release and executable tests
