# Comparing EnergyPlus to Other Programs

A paper comparing and contrasting Energy Simulation Programs can be found here:

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf

As this paper was published in 2005, it is out of date (at least with current EnergyPlus capabilities).

The feature highlights from EnergyPlus releases can be seen here:

In addition you can see how EnergyPlus compares to other programs (which have submitted their models) in our testing reports:
