# Locations-DesignDays

This file (Locations-DesignDays.xls) can be found in the MacroDataSets folder. While not strictly a macro file, it leads one to be able to download the ASHRAE design day definitions from the EnergyPlus website. The spreadsheet format contains a sheet for each of the WMO regions as well as the California Climate Zones, specifically sheets included are:

- Readme – an upfront readme page
- WMO1 Africa
- WMO2 Asia
- WMO3 South America
- WMO4 North & Central America
- CZ Files – California Climate Zones
- WMO5 Southwest Pacific
- WMO6 Europe
- WMO7 Antarctica

Each WMO (World Meteorological Organization) page contains the countries represented, specific cities that have design conditions data from ASHRAE, a link to the full imf file with location, daylighting saving and design day definitions as well as a link to that region's weather page on the EnergyPlus website. Pressing the links here will allow you to download the files.
