# Weather Data Availability

Typically, acquisition of weather data has been a user's burden. Though this will remain the case in many instances for EnergyPlus users, the EnergyPlus team has been successful in making a wealth of US, Canadian and International data available to our users. To summarize, the weather data for 2092 locations is available at the EnergyPlus web site: www.energyplus.gov

- The details are shown in Table 18. Summary of Downloadable Weather Data by Type.   This data has been selected with the energy simulation user in mind. All the data (as well as the statistical reports â€“ described later in this document) are downloadable for individual locations.
