# Data Sources/Uncertainty

More recent weather data source files have introduced the concept of data sources and uncertainty flags for many of the fields. The EnergyPlus weather format faithfully reproduces these fields as appropriate for the input source data types. By and large, most of the data sources and uncertainties have used the TMY2 established fields and values (See following table). As noted earlier, to enhance readability and reduce obfuscation, the EnergyPlus format for the data source and uncertainty flags collates them into one large field. Each data element still has its data source and uncertainty: it is positionally embodied depending on its place in the EPW data record.

The definition of the solar radiation source flags and solar radiation uncertainty flags are shown in the following two tables:

Table: Solar Radiation and Illuminance Data Source Flag Codes

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Flag Code  Definition
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------
     A      Post-1976 measured solar radiation data as received from
            NCDC or other sources

     B      Same as "A" except the global horizontal data underwent a
            calibration correction

     C      Pre-1976 measured global horizontal data (direct and
            diffuse were not measured before 1976), adjusted from solar
            to local time, usually with a calibration correction

     D      Data derived from the other two elements of solar radiation
            using the relationship, global = diffuse + direct Â´
            cosine (zenith)

     E      Modeled solar radiation data using inputs of observed sky
            cover (cloud amount) and aerosol optical depths derived
            from direct normal data collected at the same location

     F      Modeled solar radiation data using interpolated sky cover
            and aerosol optical depths derived from direct normal data
            collected at the same location

     G      Modeled solar radiation data using observed sky cover and
            aerosol optical depths estimated from geographical
            relationships

     H      Modeled solar radiation data using interpolated sky cover
            and estimated aerosol optical depths

     I      Modeled illuminance or luminance data derived from measured
            or modeled solar radiation data

     ?      Source does not fit any of the above categories. Used for
            nighttime values and missing data

Finally, the Meteorological data source and uncertainty flag/codes are shown in the following two tables:

Table: Meteorological Data Source Flag Codes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Flag  Definition
------ -------------------------------------------------------------------
  A    Data as received from NCDC, converted to SI units

  B    Linearly interpolated

  C    Non-linearly interpolated to fill data gaps from 6 to 47 hours in
       length

  D    Not used

  E    Modeled or estimated, except: precipitable water, calculated from
       radiosonde data; dew point temperature calculated from dry bulb
       temperature and relative humidity; and relative humidity
       calculated from dry bulb temperature and dew point temperature

  F    Precipitable water, calculated from surface vapor pressure;
       aerosol optical depth, estimated from geographic correlation

  ?    Source does not fit any of the above. Used mostly for missing data

Table: Meteorological Uncertainty Flag Codes

Flag|Definition

7|Uncertainty consistent with NWS practices and the instrument or observation used to obtain the data
8|Greater uncertainty than 7 because values were interpolated or estimated
9|Greater uncertainty than 8 or unknown.
0|Not definable.
