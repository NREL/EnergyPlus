# Exporting  EnergyPlus as a Functional Mock-up Unit for co-simulation

The FMU export of EnergyPlus allows EnergyPlus to be accessed from other simulation environments, as a FMU for co-simulation.

FMUs are formally specified in the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard, an open standard designed to enable links between disparate simulation programs. The standard is available from http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/.

To export EnergyPlus as a FMU for co-simulation, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has developed a utility which exports EnergyPlus as a FMU for co-simulation. This utility is freely available from http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov.
