# Sizing 

Several internal variables relate to sizing calculations. Although the primary intent for the EMS is to enable custom controls for operation, using internal variables is a prime example of extending the power of user-defined calculations to control certain aspects of sizing calculations.

## Sizing:Zone

A series of internal variables is available related to zone sizing:

- Final Zone Design Heating Air Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
