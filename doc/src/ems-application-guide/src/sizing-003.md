# Sizing

## Sizing:Zone

A series of actuators called "Sizing:Zone" is available. These offer a way to override the results of zone sizing calculations. The unique identifier for each is the name of the Zone Input object. The following control types are available:

Zone Design Heating Air Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)

Zone Design Cooling Air Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)

Zone Design Heating Load (W)

Zone Design Cooling Load (W)

Zone Design Heating Vol Flow (m^3^/s)

Zone Design Cooling Vol Flow (m^3^/s)

## System Sizing

A series of actuators called "Sizing:System" is available. These offer a way to override the results of air system sizing calculations. The unique identifier is the name of the AirLoopHVAC input object. The following control types are available:

Main Supply Volume Flow Rate (m^3^/s)

Main Supply Coincident Peak Cooling Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)

Main Supply Coincident Peak Heating Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)

Main Supply Noncoincident Peak Cooling Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)

Main Supply Noncoincident Peak Heating Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)

Main Heating Volume Flow Rate (m^3^/s)

Main Cooling Volume Flow Rate (m^3^/s)
