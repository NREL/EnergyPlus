## Generator Nominal Ratings

The internal variables called "Generator Nominal Maximum Power" and "Generator Nominal Thermal To Electric Power" provide information about the nominal capacity of a generator to produce electricity and heat. The values made available here are those listed in the associated ElectricLoadCenter:Generators input object. The power is expressed in Watts.

The thermal-to-electric ratio describes how the nominal thermal output compares to the nominal electrical output and is useful for characterizing combined heat and power (CHP) units.

## Electrical Storage

The internal variable called "Electrical Storage Maximum Capacity" provides information about the capacity of electrical storage devices. This is the value of the field called Maximum Storage Capacity in the ElectricLoadCenter:Storage:Simple input object. The units are in Joules.
