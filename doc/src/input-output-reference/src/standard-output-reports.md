# Standard Output Reports

The following objects allow standard reports to be defined and utilized in EnergyPlus:

- Output:Table:TimeBins
- Output:Table:Monthly
- Output:Table:SummaryReports
- OutputControl:Table:Style

No **Output:Meter** or **Output:Variable** objects need to be specified to use the standard reports. A good set of example reports are available in the StandardReports.idf file in the DataSets directory of EnergyPlus.
