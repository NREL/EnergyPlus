# Group â€“ Performance Curves

This group of objects primarily consists of polynomial curves that are used to characterize the performance of HVAC equipment. Several other non-polynomial curves are also included to characterize the performance of pumps and fans. All of the curves are input, stored, and evaluated entirely within the CurveManager module. The curves are usually derived from fits or regressions to data covering a limited range. Results for independent variable values outside this range are likely to be invalid, so curve input always contains a range of validity (maximum and minimum permitted values) for each independent variable and can optionally have limits on the curve ouput. No error or warning message is issued if an independent variable is outside the range. Instead, the curve manager uses the minimum value if an independent variable is less than the minimum, and the maximum if a variable exceeds the maximum. Similarly, no error or warning message is issued if the curve output is outside the range of the optional minimum and maximum curve output limits. Instead, the curve manager uses the minimum and maximum curve limits to cap the output of the performance curve.

Curve names must be unique across all curve types.

## Curve:Linear

Input for the linear curve consists of a curve name, the two coefficients, and the maximum and minimum valid independent variable values. Optional inputs for curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the performance curve (e.g., limit extrapolation). The equation represented by the linear curve is:

## Curve:Functional:PressureDrop

Input for a pressure drop curve consists of the curve name, a varying number of parameters, and the maximum and minimum valid independent variable values. The equation represented by the pressure drop curve is:

![](media/image574.png)\


### Inputs

#### Field: Name

A user assigned unique name for an instance of a pressure drop curve. When a curve is used, it is referenced by this name.

#### Field: Diameter

This diameter represents an equivalent diameter for the given branch. This is parameter (D) in the equation, and has units of {m}. Since varying components may be found on the same branch, this value must be selected along with the other inputs in order to provide a proper value of pressure drop. This is used to calculate the velocity in addition to being used directly in the frictional pressure drop calculation.

#### Field: Minor Loss Coefficient

This is the pressure drop coefficient typically applied to components such as fittings and occasionally heat pumps. This is parameter (K) in the equation and is dimensionless. This coefficient is used to describe the amount of dynamic pressure lost during the process. This value may be left blank if the user only wants to account for frictional losses in this branch.

#### Field: Length

This is the length of a pressure drop process in which friction is applied. This is parameter (L) in the equation and has units of {m}. In a pipe, this would be the length of the pipe, however in many cases, pressure drop in other components are applied as an "equivalent length."  This is only required if the user is wanting to perform frictional pressure drop calculations.

#### Field: Roughness

This field represents the first method to simulate frictional losses. This parameter does not appear directly in the equation above, as it is only used to develop the friction factor (f), but the roughness will have units of {m} if entered. If the user enters this roughness value, the pressure system will use it along with an approximation to the Moody chart to estimate the friction factor given the current flow conditions. This allows the friction calculate to be dynamic throughout the simulation.

#### Field: Fixed Friction Factor

This field represents the second method to simulate frictional losses. This is parameter (f) in the equation and is dimensionless. This parameter is a fixed value of friction factor which would override any calculations performed based on roughness, etc. If the user has a known friction factor for a given component, this is where it should be entered.

## Curve:FanPressureRise

Input for the fan total pressure rise curve consists of the curve name, the four coefficients, and the maximum and minimum valid independent variable values. Optional inputs for the curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the performance curve (e.g., limit extrapolation). The equation is:

![](media/image575.png)\


where Î”*P~fan,tot~* is the fan total pressure rise (Pa) as a function of volumetric flow through the fan (*Q~fan~*, m^3^/s), duct static pressure set point (*P~sm~*, Pa), and static pressure surrounding the ducts (*P~o~*, Pa). *P~o~* is assumed to be zero.

The first term of the curve looks like the common system curve in which the fan pressure rise is proportional to the square of the fan flow, but here it also depends implicitly on supply and return pressure losses, and in part on the fraction of the fan flow that is outdoor air (essentially "leaks" into and out of the return side of the system). Very often it is the only term considered, but that would only be correct with fixed-position dampers, no distribution system leakage, no linear resistance components, and no duct static pressure control.

The second term accounts for significant flow resistances in the system where the pressure difference is linearly proportional to the flow. Some filters and coils in the return may need this term to be adequately described. This term could be ignored if there are no linear components or if their pressure drops are very small compared to the other terms.

The third term, which depends on the fan flow and square root of the supply duct pressure *P~sm~*, accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. In this case, reducing or eliminating supply leakage results in a different system curve. This, however, might be only a minor "correction" to the simple system curves generally used. The third term is zero when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. Consequently, with variable-position supply dampers, reducing or eliminating supply leakage does not change the system curve.

The last term also accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. This term indicates that the same fan pressure rise can be achieved by raising the duct pressure and closing dampers. The only change in the system in such a case is that the leakage flow may increase. The coefficient for this term is one when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. In both cases, this term may be the most important "correction" to the simple system curves generally used, especially at low flows.

## Performance Curve Outputs

### Performance Curve Output Value

The current value of the performance curve. This value is averaged over the time step being reported. Inactive or unused performance curves will show a value of -999 (e.g., equipment is off, a specific performance curve is not required for this aspect of the equipment model at this time step, etc.). This value means that the performance curve was not called during the simulation and, therefore, not evaluated. This inactive state value is only set at the beginning of each environment. When averaging over long periods of time, this inactive state value may skew results. In this case, use a detaled reporting frequency (ref. [Output:Variable](#outputvariable) object) to view results at each HVAC time step.

### Performance Curve Input Variable 1(-N) Value []

The current value of the nth independent variable passed to the performance curve. The order of the independent variables is in the same order as the model equation represented by this performance curve object. This value is averaged over the time step being reported.
