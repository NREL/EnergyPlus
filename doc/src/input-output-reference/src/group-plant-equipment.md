# Group â€“ Plant Equipment

## Equipment Types 

In each **PlantEquipmentList** described using the above syntax, various equipment types and names must be given. Each type-name pair must then have a corresponding equipment definition. This subsection lists the various equipment types that are available and examples from an IDF. Where appropriate, notes and comments on the input structure are provided.

## Generic Chiller Outputs

Many output variable names are common across all chiller types. These generic chiller output names all begin with the word "Chiller". Certain chiller types have additional output variables which are specific to that type of chiller. Chiller energy use is added to the appropriate plant-level meters as a cooling end-use.

### Chiller Electric Power [W]

### Chiller Electric Energy [J] 

These outputs are the electric power input to the chiller. In the case of steam or fuel-powered chillers, this repesents the internal chiller pumps and other electric power consumption. Consumption is metered on Cooling:Electricity, Electricity:Plant, and Electricity:Facility.

### Chiller Evaporator Cooling Rate [W]

### Chiller Evaporator Cooling Energy [J] 

These outputs are the evaporator heat transfer which is the cooling delivered by the chiller. Chiller Evaporator Cooling Energy is metered on Chillers:EnergyTransfer, EnergyTransfer:Plant, and EnergyTransfer:Facility.

### Chiller Evaporator Inlet Temperature [C]

### Chiller Evaporator Outlet Temperature [C]

### Chiller Evaporator Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

These outputs are the evaporator (chilled water) inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rate.

### Chiller COP [W/W]

This output is the coefficient of performance for the chiller during cooling operation. It is calculated as the evaporator heat transfer rate (Chiller Evaporator Cooling Rate) divided by the "fuel" consumption rate by the chiller. For the constant COP and electric chillers, the "fuel" is electricity so the divisor is Chiller Electric Power [W]. For the absorption chiller, the "fuel" is steam so the divisor is Steam Consumption Rate [W].

*Note that this variable is reported as zero when the chiller is not operating. When reported for frequencies longer than "detailed" (such as timestep, hourly, daily, monthly or environment), this output will only be meaningful when the chiller is operating for the entire reporting period. To determine an average COP for a longer time period, compute the COP based on total evaporator heat transfer divided by total electric or fuel input over the desired period.*

### Chiller Part Load Ratio

This output is the operating part-load ratio of the indirect absorption chiller. This output may fall below the minimum part-load ratio specified in the input. For this case, the Chiller Cycling Ratio is used to further define the performance of the indirect absorption chiller.

### Chiller Cycling Ratio

*This output is the fraction of the timestep the indirect absorption chiller operates. When the chiller operates above the minimum part-load ratio, a Chiller Cycling Ratio of 1 is reported. When the chiller operates below the minimum part-load ratio, the Chiller Cycling Ratio reports the fraction of the timestep the indirect absorption chiller operates.*

### Chiller Condenser Heat Transfer Rate [W]

### Chiller Condenser Inlet Temperature [C]

This output is the condenser (heat rejection) inlet temperature for air-cooled or evap-cooled chillers. For an air-cooled chiller, this output would be the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil.

These outputs are the heat recovery inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rate for chillers with heat recovery such as engine-driven and gas turbine chillers.

### Chiller Effective Heat Rejection Temperature [C]

This output variable is available for heat recovery chillers that model split bundle condenser.  The condenser fluid temperatures used to characterize chiller performance are modified to account for the temperature of the heat recovery fluid.  This output is the resulting temperature used for characterizing chiller performance and is a blend of the temperatures in the condenser and heat recovery fluid streams.  For the [Chiller:Electric](#chillerelectric) and [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) models, this is an effective inlet temperature while for the [Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR](#chillerelectricreformulatedeir) model, this is an effective outlet temperature.

![](media/image133.png)\


The following three fields contain the coefficients for the equation.

#### Field: Chilled Water Outlet Temperature Lower Limit

This numeric field contains the lower limit for the evaporator outlet temperature. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the fluid doesn't get too cold.

#### Field: Generator Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Generator Inlet Node. A steam or hot water loop is not required to simulate an absorption chiller. If a steam/hot water loop is used, enter the name of the generator inlet node.

#### Field: Generator Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Generator Outlet Node. A steam or hot water loop is not required to simulate an absorption chiller. If a steam/hot water loop is used, enter the name of the generator outlet node.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  "NotModulated," "ConstantFlow," and "LeavingSetpointModulated."  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint at the evaporator outlet.  For this absorption chiller, this mode also affects the flow rate on the generator connection.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.  This flow mode does not impact the condenser loop connection.

#### Field: Generator Fluid Type

This choice field specifies the type of fluid used to heat the generator solution. The valid choices are **HotWater** or **Steam**. This field should be specified as Steam or left blank if the generator inlet/outlet nodes are not specified.

#### Field: Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the absorption chiller's design condenser fluid flow rate in cubic meters per second.

#### Field: Degree of Subcooling in Steam Generator

Ideally, the steam trap located at the outlet of the generator should remove all the condensate immediately, however, there is a delay in this process in actual systems which causes the condensate to SubCool by a certain amount before leaving the generator. This amount of subcooling is included in the heat transferred to the solution in the generator. The minimum value is 0Âº Celsius and default is 5Âº Celsius. This field is not used when the generator inlet/outlet node are not specified or the generator is connected to a hot water loop.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Nominal Pumping Power, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate, Design Condenser Water Flow Rate and Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

## Chiller:Absorption:Indirect

The [Chiller:Absorption:Indirect](#chillerabsorptionindirect) object is an enhanced version of the absorption chiller model found in the [Building](#building) Loads and System Thermodynamics (BLAST) program. This enhanced model is nearly identical to the existing absorption chiller model (Ref. [Chiller:Absorption](#chillerabsorption)) with the exceptions that: 1) the enhanced indirect absorption chiller model provides more flexible performance curves and 2) chiller performance now includes the impact of varying evaporator, condenser, and generator temperatures. Since these absorption chiller models are nearly identical (i.e., the performance curves of the enhanced model can be manipulated to produce similar results to the previous model), it is quite probable that the [Chiller:Absorption](#chillerabsorption) model will be deprecated in a future release of EnergyPlus.

#### Field: Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate

This numeric field specifies the chiller's design generator *fluid* flow rate in cubic meters per second. The value specified must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable. For variable flow chillers this is the maximum generator flow rate, for constant flow chillers this is the flow rate.

#### Field: Temperature Lower Limit Generator Inlet

This numeric field specifies the lower limit of the generator's entering water temperature. This field is not used iif the Generator Fluid Type is specified as steam.

#### Field: Degree of Subcooling in Steam Generator

Ideally the steam trap located at the outlet of generator should remove all the condensate immediately, however there is a delay in this process in actual systems which causes the condensate to SubCool by a certain degree before leaving the generator. This amount of subcooling is included in the heat transferred to the solution in the generator. The minimum value is 0Âº Celsius, the maximum value is 20Âº Celsius, and the default is 1Âº Celsius.

#### Field: Degree of Subcooling in Steam Condensate Loop

This essentially represents the heat loss to the atmosphere due to uninsulated condensate return piping to the boiler. Condensate return piping operates at atmospheric pressure and is not insulated. The condensate sub cools to certain degree before it is pumped back to the boiler. The minimum value is 0Âº Celsius and the default is 0Âº Celsius.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Nominal Pumping Power, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate, Design Condenser Water Flow Rate and Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

## Chiller:ConstantCOP

This chiller model is based on a simple, constant COP simulation of the chiller. In this case, performance does not vary with chilled water temperature or condenser conditions.

Such a model is useful when the user does not have access to detailed performance data.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller.

#### Field: Nominal Capacity

**This numeric field contains the nominal cooling capability of the chiller in Watts.**

#### Field: Nominal COP

This numeric field contains the Chiller's coefficient of performance.

#### Field: Design Chilled Water Flow Rate

For variable volume chiller this is the maximum flow and for constant flow chiller this is the design flow rate. The units are in cubic meters per second.

#### Field: Design Condenser Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the electric chiller's design condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable. This field is not used for Condenser Type = AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled.

#### Field: Chilled Water Inlet Node Name

**This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller plant side inlet node.**

#### Field: Chilled Water Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller plant side outlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller condenser side inlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and a condenser inlet node name is specified here, the node name specified must also be specified in an [OutdoorAir:Node](#outdoorairnode) object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an [OutdoorAir:NodeList](#outdoorairnodelist) object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates an outdoor air node and the air temperature information on this node is taken directly from the weather file (no node height adjustment).

#### Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller condenser side outlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates a condenser side outlet air node.

#### Field: Condenser Type

This alpha field determines what type of condenser will be modeled with this chiller. The 3 type of condensers are AirCooled, WaterCooled, and EvaporativelyCooled with the default being AirCooled if not specified. AirCooled and EvaporativelyCooled do not require a [CondenserLoop](#condenserloop) to be specified, whereas the WaterCooled option requires the full specification of the [CondenserLoop](#condenserloop) and its associated equipment.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  "NotModulated," "ConstantFlow," and "LeavingSetpointModulated."  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (ËšC) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2ËšC, and the default value is 2ËšC if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  "NotModulated," "ConstantFlow," and "LeavingSetpointModulated."  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate

This is the design flow rate used if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 then a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next 2 node fields. To determine how the heat recovery algorithm works look at the Enegineering Manual at the [Chiller:Electric](#chillerelectric) with Heat Recovery section. The units are in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable.  When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric chiller heat recovery side inlet node. A heat recovery loop must be specified.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric chiller heat recovery side outlet node. A heat recovery loop must be specified.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (ËšC) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2ËšC, and the default value is 2ËšC if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

#### Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction

This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluids.

## Chiller:Electric:EIR

This chiller model is the empirical model used in the DOE-2.1 building energy simulation program. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer's catalog data or measured data. Performance curves for more than 160 chillers, including the default DOE-2.1E reciprocating and centrifugal chillers, are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf).

> Note: [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) objects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should normally be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with caution.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric EIR chiller.

#### Field: Reference Capacity

This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the chiller in Watts. This should be the capacity of the chiller at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. Alternately, this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference COP

This numeric field contains the chiller's coefficient of performance. This value should **not** include energy use due to pumps or cooling tower fans. This COP should be at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. This value **should** include evap-cooled or air-cooled condenser fans except when the Condenser Fan Power Ratio input field defined below is used and that input value is greater than 0. For the case when condenser fan power is modeled separately, the calculated condenser fan energy is reported on the same electric meter as compressor power. Be careful to not duplicate this energy use.

#### Field: Reference Leaving Chilled Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller's reference leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 6.67Â°C.

#### Field: Reference Entering Condenser Fluid Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller's reference entering condenser fluid temperature in Celsius. The default value is 29.4Â°C. For water-cooled chillers this is the water temperature entering the condenser (e.g., leaving the cooling tower). For air- or evap-cooled condensers this is the entering outdoor air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature, respectively.

#### Field: Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate

For a variable flow chiller this is the maximum water flow rate and for a constant flow chiller this is the operating water flow rate through the chiller's evaporator. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference Condenser Fluid Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the chiller's operating condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field can be autosized. This field is also used to enter the air flow rate if Condenser Type = AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and Heat Recovery is specified..

#### Field: Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the cooling capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the entering condenser fluid temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the entering condenser fluid temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

The name of a quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRfTPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller's available cooling capacity. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio's would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0 (i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR's slightly above or below this line (i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The quadratic curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. Below this part-load ratio, the compressor cycles on and off to meet the cooling load. The Minimum Part Load Ratio must be less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.1.

#### Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller's maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.0. The Maximum Part Load Ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller's optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Minimum Unloading Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum unloading ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum unloading ratio is where the chiller capacity can no longer be reduced by unloading and must be false loaded to meet smaller cooling loads. A typical false loading strategy is hot-gas bypass. The minimum unloading ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.2.

#### Field: Chilled Water Side Inlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) inlet node.

#### Field: Chilled Water Side Outlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) outlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side inlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and a condenser inlet node name is specified here, the node name specified must also be specified in an [OutdoorAir:Node](#outdoorairnode) object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an [OutdoorAir:NodeList](#outdoorairnodelist) object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates an outdoor air node and the air temperature information on this node is taken directly from the weather file (no node height adjustment).

#### Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side outlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates a condenser side outlet air node.

#### Field: Condenser Type

This alpha field determines what type of condenser will be modeled with this chiller. Valid condenser types are AirCooled, WaterCooled, and EvaporativelyCooled with the default being WaterCooled if not specified. AirCooled and EvaporativelyCooled do not require a Condenser Loop to be specified, whereas the WaterCooled option requires the full specification of the Condenser Loop and its associated equipment.

#### Field: Condenser Fan Power Ratio

This field is used to model condenser fan power associated with air-cooled or evaporatively-cooled condensers (for cooling towers, refer to Group - Condenser Equipment). Enter the ratio of the condenser fan power to the reference chiller cooling capacity in W/W. If this input is greater than 0, the condenser fan power is modeled seperatly from compressor power. In addition, if condenser fan power is modeled using this input, the reference COP and "Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of " performance curves should not include condenser fan power.

#### Field: Fraction of Compressor Electric Power Rejected by Condenser

This numeric input represents the fraction of compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. Enter a value of 1.0 when modeling hermetic chillers. For open chillers, enter the compressor motor efficiency. This value must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, with a default value of 1.0.

#### Field: Leaving Chilled Water Lower Temperature Limit

This numeric field contains the lower limit for the leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the fluid doesn't get too cold. This input field is currently unused. The default value is 2C.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  "NotModulated," "ConstantFlow," and "LeavingSetpointModulated."  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate

This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 (or Autosize), a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.  This field is autosizable.  When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Side Inlet Node

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side inlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Side Outlet Node

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side outlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Capacity, Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate and Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (ËšC) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2ËšC, and the default value is 2ËšC if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

#### Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction

This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluilds.

Most of these chiller output variables are defined above under "Generic Chiller Outputs."  Output variables not described above are discussed here.

#### Chiller Condenser Fan Electric Power  [W]

#### Chiller Condenser Fan Electric Energy  [J] 

These outputs are for the electric power consumption of the chiller condenser fan and are applicable to air- or evaporatively-cooled chillers. These reports are available only for the [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) and only when the Condenser Fan Power Ratio input field is greater than 0. This output is also added to a meter object with Resource Type = Electricity, End Use Key = Chillers, Group Key = Plant (Ref. [Output:Meter](#outputmeter-and-outputmetermeterfileonly) objects).

#### Chiller Capacity Temperature Modifier Multiplier []

This is the output of the curve object Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve.

#### Chiller EIR Temperature Modifier Multiplier []

This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve.

#### Chiller EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier []

This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Curve.

#### Chiller Part Load Ratio []

This output is the ratio of the evaporator heat transfer rate plus the false load heat transfer rate (if applicable) to the available chiller capacity. This value is used to determine Chiller EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier.

#### Chiller Cycling Ratio []

The cycling ratio is the amount of time the chiller operates during each simulation timestep. If the chiller part-load ratio falls below the minimum part-load ratio, the chiller cycles on and off to meet the cooling load.

#### Chiller False Load Heat Transfer Rate [W]

#### Chiller False Load Heat Transfer Energy [J]

These outputs are the heat transfer rate and total heat transfer due to false loading of the chiller. When the chiller part-load ratio is below the minimum unloading ratio, the chiller false loads (e.g. hot-gas bypass) to further reduce capacity. The false load heat transfer output variable is not metered.

## Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR

This chiller model, developed through the CoolToolsâ„¢ project sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), is an empirical model similar to EnergyPlus' [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) model. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. The model has the same capabilities as the [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) model, but can potentially provide significant accuracy improvement over the [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) model for variable-speed compressor drive and variable condenser water flow applications. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer's catalog data or measured data. Performance curves developed from manufacturer's performance data are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf). This chiller model can be used to predict the performance of various chiller types (e.g., reciprocating, screw, scroll, and centrifugal) with water-cooled condensers.

The main difference between this model and the [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) model is the condenser fluid temperature used in the associated performance curves: the [Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR](#chillerelectricreformulatedeir) model uses the LEAVING condenser water temperature while the [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) model uses the ENTERING condenser water temperature.

> Note: Chiller:Electric:Reformulated EIR objects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should almost always be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with extreme caution. For example, if the user wishes to model a chiller size that is different from the reference capacity, it is highly recommended that the reference flow rates be scaled proportionately to the change in reference capacity. Although this model can provide more accurate prediction than the [Chiller:Electric:EIR](#chillerelectriceir) model, it requires more performance data to develop the associated performance curves (at least 12 points from full-load performance and 7 points from part-load performance).

### Inputs

#### Field: Chiller Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for this chiller.

#### Field: Reference Capacity

This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the chiller in Watts. This should be the capacity of the chiller at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. Alternately, this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference COP

This numeric field contains the chiller's coefficient of performance. This value should **not** include energy use due to pumps or cooling tower fans. This COP should be at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below.

#### Field: Reference Leaving Chilled Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller's reference leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 6.67Â°C.

#### Field: Reference Leaving Condenser Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller's reference leaving condenser water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 35Â°C.

#### Field: Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate

For a variable flow chiller this is the maximum water flow rate and for a constant flow chiller this is the operating water flow rate through the chiller's evaporator. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the chiller's operating condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the cooling capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

The name of a bicubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving condenser water temperature and the part-load ratio (EIRfTPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller's available cooling capacity. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference leaving condenser water temperature with the part-load ratio equal to 1.0. An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio's would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0 (i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR's slightly above or below this line (i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The bicubic curve should be valid for the range of condenser water temperatures and part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).

> Note: Although a bicubic curve requires 10 coefficients (ref. [Curve:Bicubic](#curvebicubic)), coefficients 7, 9 and 10 are typically not used in the performance curve described here and should be entered as 0 unless sufficient performance data and regression accuracy exist to justify the use of these coefficients. Additionally, coefficients 2, 3, and 6 should not be used unless sufficient temperature data is available to accurately define the performance curve (i.e., negative values may result from insufficient data).

#### Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. Below this part-load ratio, the compressor cycles on and off to meet the cooling load. The Minimum Part Load Ratio must be less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.1.

#### Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller's maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.0. The Maximum Part Load Ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller's optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Minimum Unloading Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum unloading ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum unloading ratio is where the chiller capacity can no longer be reduced by unloading and must be false loaded to meet smaller cooling loads. A typical false loading strategy is hot-gas bypass. The minimum unloading ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.2.

#### Field: Chilled Water Side Inlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) inlet node.

#### Field: Chilled Water Side Outlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) outlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Side Inlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side inlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Side Outlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side outlet node.

#### Field: Fraction of Compressor Electric Power Rejected by Condenser

This numeric input represents the fraction of compressor electrical energy consumption that ****must be rejected by the condenser. Enter a value of 1.0 when modeling hermetic chillers. For open chillers, enter the compressor motor efficiency. This value must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, with a default value of 1.0.

#### Field: Leaving Chilled Water Lower Temperature Limit

This numeric field contains the lower limit for the leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the water doesn't get too cold. This input field is currently unused. The default value is 2C.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode Type

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  "NotModulated," "ConstantFlow," and "LeavingSetpointModulated."  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate

This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 (or autosize), a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.  This field is autosizable.  When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Side Inlet Node

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side inlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified and it can only be used with a water-cooled condenser.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Side Outlet Node

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side outlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified and it can only be used with a water-cooled condenser.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Capacity, Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate and Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction

This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluilds.

#### Field: Maximum Exhaust Flow per Unit of Power Output

This numeric field contains the maximum exhaust gas mass flow rate per watt of cooling provided by the engine driven chiller

#### Field: Design Minimum Exhaust Temperature

This numeric field contains the steam saturation temperature in Celsius that would be used to determine the energy recovered from a water jacket heat exchanger on the engine.

#### Field: Fuel Type

This alpha value specifies the type of fuel used in the engine. The fuel type can be NaturalGas, PropaneGas, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil#1, FuelOil#2, OtherFuel1 or OtherFuel2. This field is required.

#### Field: Fuel Higher Heating Value

This numeric field contains the higher heating value of the fuel used in kJ/kg.

#### Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate

This numeric field specifies the heat recovery volumetric flow rate through the engine in m^3^/sec. The heat recovery loop manager and hot water tan must also be specified if heat energy is to be recovered from the engine driven chiller.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side inlet. If a loop is connected, then the jacket and lubricant heat will be recovered. There is no need for an effectiveness term, since the jacket and lubricant recovered heat energies are the actual recovered energies.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side outlet.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  "NotModulated," "ConstantFlow," and "LeavingSetpointModulated."  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Maximum Temperature for Heat Recovery at Heat Recovery Outlet Node

This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.

As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply. The temperature is specified in degrees C.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (ËšC) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2ËšC, and the default value is 2ËšC if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name

#### Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side outlet.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  "NotModulated," "ConstantFlow," and "LeavingSetpointModulated."  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Fuel Type

This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the chiller uses. Valid choices are: **NaturalGas, PropaneGas, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil#1, FuelOil#2, OtherFuel1** or **OtherFuel2**. The default is **NaturalGas**.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Maximum Temperature

This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery.  The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit.  This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.

As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller.  For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field.  The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting.  This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.

The temperature is specified in degrees C.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (ËšC) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2ËšC, and the default value is 2ËšC if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

## ChillerHeater:Absorption:DirectFired

This chiller is a direct fired absorption chiller-heater which is modeled using performance curves similar to the equivalent chiller in DOE-2.1E. This type of chiller is unusual for EnergyPlus, because it may be used in the same plant on both a chilled water supply branch and a hot water supply branch. The chiller has six node connections for chilled water, condenser water, and hot water, and can provide simultaneous heating and cooling. During simultaneous operation, the heating capacity is reduced as the cooling load increases (for more details see below). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves. For a detailed description of the algorithm and how the curves are used in the calculations, please see the Engineering Reference.

## ChillerHeater:Absorption:DoubleEffect

This chiller is an exhaust fired absorption chiller-heater which is modeled using performance curves similar to the direct fired absorption chiller in DOE-2.1E. The model uses the exhaust gas output from MicroTurbine. This type of chiller is unusual for EnergyPlus, because it may be used in the same plant on both a chilled water supply branch and a hot water supply branch. The chiller has six node connections for chilled water, condenser water, and hot water, and can provide simultaneous heating and cooling. During simultaneous operation, the heating capacity is reduced as the cooling load increases (for more details see below). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves. For a detailed description of the algorithm and how the curves are used in the calculations, please see the Engineering Reference.

## Boiler:HotWater

The boiler model calculates the performance of fuel oil, gas and electric boilers. Boiler performance is based on nominal thermal efficiency. A normailized efficiency performance curve may be used to more accurately represent the performance of non-electric boilers but is not considered a required input. When using the normalized efficiency performance curve, if all coefficients are not required simply set the unused coefficients to 0. For example, an electric boiler could be modeled by setting the nominal thermal efficiency to a value in the range of 0.96 to 1.0. Coefficient A0 in the normalized efficiency performance curve would equal 1 and all other coefficients would be set to 0. Coefficients for other types of non-electric boilers would set a combination of the available coefficents to non-zero values.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the boiler.

#### Field: Fuel Type

This required choice field specifies the type of fuel used by the boiler. The fuel type can be **Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, FuelOil#1, FuelOil#2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, OtherFuel1** or **OtherFuel2**.

#### Field: Nominal capacity

This numeric field contains the nominal operating capacity (W) of the boiler. The boiler may be autosized and would require a heating plant sizing object.

#### Fuel Use Equation

The model is based the following two equations:

![](media/image170.png)\


![](media/image171.png)\


#### Field: Nominal Thermal Efficiency

This required numeric field contains the heating efficiency (as a fraction between 0 and 1) of the boiler's burner.  This is the efficiency relative to the higher heating value (HHV) of fuel at a part load ratio of 1.0 and the temperature entered for the Design Boiler Water Outlet Temp. Manufacturers typically specify the efficiency of a boiler using the higher heating value of the fuel. For the rare occurences when a manufacturers (or particular data set) thermal efficiency is based on the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel, multiply the thermal efficiency by the lower-to-higher heating value ratio. For example, assume a fuel's lower and higher heating values are approximately 45,450 and 50,000 kJ/kg, respectively. For a manuracturers thermal effiency rating of 0.90 (based on the LHV), the nominal thermal efficiency entered here is 0.82 (i.e. 0.9 multiplied by 45,450/50,000).

#### Field: Efficiency Curve Temperature Evaluation Variable

This field is used to control which value for hot water temperature is used when evaluating the efficiency curve specified in the next field (if applicable).  There are two options,  EnteringBoiler or LeavingBoiler.  EnteringBoiler indicates that the efficiency curves will be evaluated using the temperature at boiler inlet node.  LeavingBoiler indicates that the efficiency curves will be evaluated using the temperature at the boiler outlet.  This field is only used if type of curve is one that uses temperature as a independent variable.

#### Field: Normalized Boiler Efficiency Curve Name

This alpha field contains the curve name which describes the normalized heating efficiency (as a fraction of nominal thermal efficiency) of the boiler's burner. If this field is left blank, the nominal thermal efficiency is assumed to be constant (i.e., Fuel Used is equal to the Theoretical Fuel Use in the equation above). When a boiler efficiency curve is used, the curve may be any valid curve object with 1 (PLR) or 2 (PLR and boiler outlet water temperature) independent variables. A tri-quadratic curve object is not allowed since it uses 3 independent variables. The linear, quadratic, and cubic curve types may be used when the boiler efficiency is soley a function of boiler part-load ratio (PLR). When this type of curve is used, the boiler should operate at (or very near) the design boiler water outlet temperature. Other curve types may be used when the boiler efficiency is a function of both PLR and boiler water temperature. Examples of valid single and dual independent variable equations are shown below. For all curve types PLR is always the x independent variable. When using 2 independent variables, the boiler outlet water temperature (Toutlet) is always the y independent variable.

where

Eff = normalized boiler efficiency

PLR = boiler part-load ratio

T~w~ = boiler water temperature [ÂºC] ], this can be either entering or leaving temperature depending on the setting in the previous field

#### Field: Design Water Outlet Temperature

This numeric field contains the desired boiler water outlet temperature in Celsius.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the maximum design water volumetric flow rate in m^3^/sec. This should be the largest flow rate than can be heated to the design outlet temperature. This field is autosizable.

#### Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the minimum part load ratio. If the ratio of demand to boiler nominal capacity is less than the minimum part load ratio, then the Min PLR will determine the operating PLR. The expected range is between 0 and 1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.0.

#### Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the maximum part load ratio. If the ratio of demand to boiler nominal capacity is greater than the maximum part load ratio, then the Max PLR will determine the operating PLR. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the optimum part load ratio. This is the part load ratio at which the boiler performs at its maximum efficiency. If this field is left blank, the default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Boiler Water Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the water inlet node name.

#### Field: Boiler Water Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the water outlet node name.

#### Field: Water Outlet Upper Temperature Limit

This numeric field contains the outlet temperature upper limit. If this field is left blank, the default value is 99.9ÂºC.

#### Field: Boiler Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the boiler operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  "NotModulated," "ConstantFlow," and "LeavingSetpointModulated."  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler's request for flow is more strict and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the boiler model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the boiler matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the boiler -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.   The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Parasitic Electric Load

This optional numeric field contains the parasitic electric power (W) consumed by a forced draft fan or other electrical device associated with the boiler. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the boiler is operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if the field is left blank.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity and Design Water Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

## Water to Water Heat Pumps

The EnergyPlus has two water-to-water heat pump models, parameter estimation and equation fit, to choose from:

**HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling**

**HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating**

This model is an equation-fit model from the catalog data which resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The performance of the heat pump is modeled using curves fitted from the catalog data.

**HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Cooling**

**HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Heating**

This model is a parameter estimation based model that uses physical parameters generated from the catalog data. The physical parameters are then used to predict the performance of the heat pump using thermodynamic laws and heat transfer equations. The heat pump has a reciprocating compressor that serves both the hot water and the chilled water loop. Note that this model is currently "hardwired" to fluid property R22.

Descriptions and strength of each respective model is available in the following references:

Jin, Hui. 2002. Parameter Estimation Based Models of Water Source Heat Pumps. Phd. Thesis, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Oklahoma State University. (downloadable from http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/)

Tang,C. C. 2005. Modeling Packaged Heat Pumps in Quasi-Steady State Energy Simulation Program. M.S. Thesis. Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Oklahoma State University. (downloadable from http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/)

The Supply side of the heat pump is usually connected to a Ground Heat Exchanger. The figure below shows the layout and piping diagram of the water-to-water heat pump.

## CentralHeatPumpSystem

This is a central geothermal application that contains one or more chiller-heaters centrally located in the building; the available chilled and/or hot water is then piped to the individual zones. Chiller-heaters used for this particular system can be of two types: 1) standard vapor-compression, non-reversible cycle chillers designed for heat recovery or 2) reversible-cycle, water-to-water heat pump chillers. Unlike a distributed ground source heat pump configuration where individual heat pumps are located in each zone, a centralized geothermal configuration has one or more chiller-heaters. Its function is to encapsulate the extra controls needed to turn individual chiller-heater modules on/off and whether they are to operate in cooling-only, heating-only or simultaneous cooling-heating mode and whether to connect the source water to the evaporator or condenser side. A variety of control schemes can be designed by setting schedules for both zone control types and individual chiller-heaters schedules.

The fluid used in this central system is usually water, and there is no sharing of condenser or evaporator water between multiple machines. However, the control logic is such that the source water can be delivered to individual chiller-heaters depending on their operating mode, e.g., modules in simultaneous cooling-heating mode receive no source water, modules in heating-only mode can have source water directed to their evaporator, or modules in cooling-only mode can have source water directed to their condenser; the decision on which module(s) receives the source water dictated by the â€˜smart' controls. The following figures illustrate node interconnections between this central geothermal application and plant and condenser loops in various situations.

The order of the multiple chiller-heaters' operation is assumed to be sequential. In other words, the very first chiller-heater will be called at first to see if it meets all loads that the central heat pump system should meet. If the chiller-heater meets all loads, the rest chiller-heaters are assumed to be turned off. If not, the following chiller-heater will be called to meet the remaining loads until all loads are met in the order as defined in the set of individual chiller-heater objects below. The order of individual chiller-heater modules needs to be carefully arranged in case users are intended to see the performance of various combinations of different sizes of chiller-heaters in a central heat pump system.

![Diagram of a central heat pump system with three chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode (Condensers reject heat to the ground source loop)](media/diagram-of-a-central-heat-pump-system-with.png)


![Diagram of a central heat pump system with three chiller-heaters in heat recovery mode         (No heat is exchanged with the ground source loop)](media/diagram-of-a-central-heat-pump-system-with-001.png)


![Diagram of a central heat pump system with one chiller-heater in heat recovery mode and two chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode](media/diagram-of-a-central-heat-pump-system-with-002.png)


In the above example, the cooling load needs 3 chiller-heaters and the heating load needs 1 chiller heater. Chiller 1 is in heat recovery mode and isolated from the ground source loop while chillers 2 and 3 are in cooling-only mode, their condensers rejecting heat to the ground source loop.

![Diagram of a central heat pump system with two chiller-heaters in heat recovery mode and one chiller-heater in heating-only mode](media/diagram-of-a-central-heat-pump-system-with-003.png)


In the above example, the heating load needs 3 chiller-heaters and the cooling load needs two chiller-heaters. Chillers 1 and 2 are in heat recovery mode and isolated from the ground source loop while chiller 3 is in heating-only mode, its evaporator extracting heat from the ground source loop.

Users are required to define three different nodes such as chilled water, hot water, and source water nodes. Only this central heat pump system will be metered, and individual chiller-heaters' energy will be available for reporting only, but not metered.

## ChillerHeaterPerformance:EIectric:EIR

The performance of the chiller-heater will be defined by two sets of curves meant to describe unloading for: 1) cooling-only mode, and 2) heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. Reference conditions must be defined for both because each has its own set of three unloading curves based on their associated reference conditions. The cooling-mode curves are typically (but not always) based on condenser entering water temperature while the heating-only mode curves are typically based on condenser leaving water temperature. This chiller-heater object allows the user to specify whether to use condenser leaving or condenser entering as a dependent variable to differentiate, if necessary, the condenser temperature basis used to generate the cooling- and heating-only mode curves.

### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name of the chiller-heater to be included in a central heat pump system.

### Field: Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity

This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the evaporator in cooling mode in Watts. This value should be based on the reference temperatures and design water flow rates defined below. This field can be autosized.

### Field: Reference Cooling Mode COP

This numeric field contains the reference coefficient of performance of the evaporator for cooling. It must be based on the values of Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and Reference Cooling Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature defined in the next two fields.

### Field: Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference leaving chilled water temperature of the evaporator for cooling in Celsius. The default value is 6.67Â°C.

### Field: Reference Cooling Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference entering condenser water temperature of the condenser in the cooling mode in Celsius. The default value is 29.4Â°C.

### Field: Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Condenser Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference leaving condenser water temperature of the condenser in the cooling mode in Celsius. The default value is 35.0Â°C.

### Field: Reference Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Ratio

**This numeric field contains the evaporator's capacity during the reference heating-only or si**multaneous cooling-heating mode as a ratio of reference cooling capacity. For example, the ratio may be expressed as follows:

![](media/image183.png)\


**where** Tchw,l is the leaving chilled water temperature and Tcond,l is the leaving condenser water temperature representing the heating-mode and cooling-mode reference temperatures defined elsewhere in this object.

**The default is 0.75. This field is used to determine evaporator capacity in heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode, multiplying it by the value entered in the field of the Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity. Note that even when there is no cooling load, i.e., the machine is in heating**-only mode, the evaporator must still run and extract heat from the source water. In heating-only mode, the leaving chilled water temperature (Tchw,l) may  float depending on the evaporator water flow rate and the source water temperature. In simultaneous cooling and heating mode, the leaving chilled water temperature (Tchw,l) does not float but is determined by the chilled water setpoint controls. For both heating-only and simultaneous cooling and heating mode, the leaving condenser temperature (Tcond,l) is determined by the hot water supply setpoint controls. This value of Tchw,l, combined with Tcond,l is plugged into the CAPFT and EIRFT curves to determine the off-rated heating-mode evaporator capacity and associated compressor power.

### Field: Reference Heating Mode Cooling Power Ratio

**This numeric field contains the** compressor power during simultaneous cooling-heating mode as a ratio of reference cooling compressor power. For example, the ratio may be expressed as follows:

![](media/image184.png)\


**The default value is 1.5. This field is used to determine** full load compressor power at the simultaneous cooling-heating mode's reference chilled water leaving and condenser water leaving temperatures. Note: In heating-only mode, the chilled water leaving temperature floats so the EIRFT curve is used to modify the simultaneouos cooling-heating full load compressor power value.

### Field: Reference Heating Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature

**This numeric field contains the reference** leaving chilled water temperature of the evaporator in simultaneous cooling-heating mode in Celsius. This is typically the same as the reference cooling mode value and is used to create the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode unloading curves. The leaving chilled water temperature for the chiller-heater is not allowed to fall below this value during the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode. The default value is 6.67Â°C.

### Field: Reference Heating Mode Leaving Condenser Water Temperature

**This numeric field contains the reference leaving** condenser water temperature of the condenser in heating mode in Celsius. This field is typically controlled to the design hot water supply temperature, and used to create the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode unloading curves. The default value is 60.0Â°C.

### Field: Reference Heating Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature

**This numeric field contains the reference** entering condenser water temperature of the condenser in heating mode in Celsius. This field typically represents the upper limit of the source water temperature. The default value is 29.44Â°C.

### Field: Heating Mode Entering Chilled Water Temperature Low Limit

**This numeric field contains the** low limit of the entering chilled water temperature in heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode in Celsius. This field typically represents the lower limit of the source water temperature. If necessary, auxiliary heat will be activated to prevent source water temperature falling below the chilled water entering minimum. The default value is 12.2Â°C.

### Field: Chilled Water Flow Mode Type

**This** alpha field contains the chilled water flow control mode. Valid water flow mode includes constant flow and variable flow, and the default water flow mode is constant flow.

### Field: Design Chilled Water Flow Rate

**This** numeric field contains the design chilled water flow rate in m^3^/s. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this field is autosizable.

### Field: Design Condenser Water Flow Rate

**This** numeric field contains the design condenser water flow rate in m^3^/s. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this field is autosizable.

### Field: Design Hot Water Flow Rate

**This** numeric field contains the design hot water flow rate in m^3^/s. The minimum value and default value for this field are zero, and this field is autosizable.

### Field: Compressor Motor Efficiency

**This** numeric field contains the fraction of efficiency of the compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. This value must be between 0.0 and 1.0, and the default value is 1.0.

### Field: Condenser Type

**This** alpha field contains the type of condenser. WaterCooled is the only valid type, and it requires the full specification of the condenser loop and its associated equipment.

### Field: Cooling Mode Temperature Curve Condenser Water Independent Variable

**This** alpha field determines whether the entering or leaving condenser water temperature is used in the cooling mode unloading performance curves that follow. Valid variables include EnteringCondenser and LeavingCondenser, and the default variable is EnteringCondenser. The condenser temperature used for the cooling mode unloading performance curves will be dependent on this field input. For example, leaving condenser water temperature will be used when the LeavingCondenser is chosen, otherwise entering condenser water temperature.

### Field: Cooling Mode Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name

**This alpha field contains t**he name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the evaporator capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined in the previous field. It is then multiplied by the reference evaporator capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

### Field: Cooling Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

**This alpha field contains t**he name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined by the user. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. It is then multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

This alpha field contains the name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRFPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the available cooling capacity of the chiller-heater. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. Note that the bi-cubic formulation is generally only valid when LeavingCondenser variable is chosen for the field of Cooling Mode Condenser Water Temperature Curve Input Variable whereas the quadratic curve can be used both choices, i.e., LeavingCondenser and EnteringCondenser. The output of this curve is then multiplied by the reference full-load EIR and the EIRFT to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. The curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.

### Field: Cooling Mode Cooling Capacity Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller-heater's optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the minimum part-load ratio, and less than or equal to the maximum part-load ratio. (Note: Both the minimum part-load ratio and maximum part-load ratio are taken from the Cooling Mode EIRFPLR curve definition.) The default value is 1.0.

### Field: Heating Mode Temperature Curve Condenser Water Independent Variable

This alpha field determines whether the entering or leaving condenser water temperature is used in the heating mode unloading performance curves that follow. Valid variables include EnteringCondenser and LeavingCondenser, and the default variable is EnteringCondenser. The condenser temperature used for the cooling mode unloading performance curves will be dependent on this field input. For example, leaving condenser water temperature will be used when the LeavingCondenser is chosen, otherwise entering condenser water temperature.

### Field: Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the evaporator capacity in heating mode as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined in the previous field. This curve is used to evaluate the adjusted evaporator capacity during heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. This adjusted capacity is used as part of the cooling part-load calculation for the EIRFPLR curve. It is then multiplied by the reference evaporator capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

### Field: Heating Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

**This alpha field contains t**he name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined by the user. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. It is then multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

### Field: Heating Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRFPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual evaporator load divided by the available evaporator capacity of the chiller-heater at the reference heating and simultaneous cooling-heating mode temperatures. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. Note that the bicubic formulation below can only be used when the chiller-heater uses a variable speed compressor motor drive. It is also generally valid only when LeavingCondenser variable is chosen for the field of Cooling Mode Condenser Water Temperature Curve Input Variable whereas the quadratic curve can be used both choices, i.e., LeavingCondenser and EnteringCondenser. The output of this curve is then multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the EIRFT to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. The curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.

### Field: Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller-heater's optimum part-load ratio during heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the minimum part-load ratio, and less than or equal to the maximum part-load ratio. (Note: Both the minimum part-load ratio and maximum part-load ratio are taken from the Heating Mode EIRFPLR curve definition.) The default value is 1.0.

### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The Sizing Factor is a multiplier on the design plant chilled water loop flow rate associated with the chiller-heaters parent [CentralHeatPumpSystem](#centralheatpumpsystem) object. The chiller-heater's modified chilled water flow can then be used to autocalculate the Design Condenser Water Flow Rate and Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity values. In general, it is best to autosize all three fields or set fixed values for all three fields.

Note that much of these output variables are adapted from the definitions above under "Generic Chiller Outputs" and "Electric EIR Chiller Outputs." The following outputs are repeated up to the maximum of individual chiller-heater module objects. The maximum number may be different from the number of object defined in this object when users define two or more identical chiller-heater modules for a single chiller heater object in the central heat pump system.

### Chiller Heater Operation Mode Unit <x> [  ]

This output represents the operating mode of the chiller-heater module. Two single mode outputs and three simultaneous cooling-heating mode outputs are possible:

- 0: off
- 1: cooling-only mode
- 2: heating-only mode
- 3: heat recovery mode
- 4: cooling dominant simultaneous cooling-heating mode
- 5: heating dominant simultaneous cooling-heating mode.

The first mode 0 is reported when the chiller-heater is turned off. The next two modes 2 and 3 are reported when the chiller-heater provides only either cooling or heating, respectively. The last three modes 3 to 5 indicate when the chiller-heater is in a simultaneous cooling-heating mode. Mode 3 indicates the chiller-heaters provides simultaneous cooling and heating **without** heat exchange with the ground source. Mode 4 denotes that at least one of the chiller-heater modules in the central heat pump system provides both cooling and heating, and the chiller-heater is meeting remaining cooling demand (see Figure 78. Diagram of a central heat pump system with one chiller-heater in heat recovery mode and two chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode) Similarly, mode 5 indicates that at least one of the chiller-heater modules in the central heat pump system is in the heat recovery mode, and the chiller-heater is meeting remaining heating demand (see Figure 79).

Note that the decision to operate individual chiller-heater modules is solely dependent on the chiller-heater schedule and loads. A fraction may appear in case the chiller-heater mode varies within a zone time step. In this particular case, users may define a detailed reporting frequency for this output variable.

### Chiller Heater Part Load Ratio Unit <x> [  ]

This output is the ratio of the evaporator heat transfer rate plus the false load heat transfer rate (if applicable) to the available chiller-heater capacity. This value is used to determine ChillerEIRFPLR.

### Chiller Heater Cycling Ratio Unit <x> [  ]

The cycling ratio is the amount of time the chiller-heater operates during each simulation time step. If the chiller-heater part-load ratio falls below the minimum part-load ratio, the chiller-heater cycles on and off to meet the loads.

### Chiller Heater Cooling Electric Power Unit <x> [W]

### Chiller Heater Cooling Electric Energy Unit <x> [J]

These outputs are the cooling electric power consumption of the chiller-heater.

### Chiller Heater Heating Electric Power Unit <x> [W]

### Chiller Heater Heating Electric Energy Unit <x> [J]

These outputs are the heating electric power consumption of the chiller-heater.

### Chiller Heater Cooling Rate Unit <x> [W]

### Chiller Heater Cooling Energy Unit <x> [J]

**These outputs are the evaporator heat transfer which is the cooling delivered by the** chiller-heater module.

### Chiller Heater False Load Heat Transfer Rate Unit <x> [W]

### Chiller Heater False Load Heat Transfer Energy Unit <x> [J]

These outputs are the heat transfer rate and total heat transfer due to false loading of the chiller-heater. When the chiller-heater part-load ratio is below the minimum unloading ratio, the chiller-heater false loads (e.g. hot-gas bypass) to further reduce capacity.

### Chiller Heater Condenser Heat Transfer Rate Unit <x> [C]

### Chiller Heater Condenser Heat Transfer Energy Unit <x> [C]

**These outputs** are the heat transfer which is the heating delivered by the chiller-heater module in heating mode.

### Chiller Heater Evaporator Inlet Temperature Unit <x> [C]

### Chiller Heater Evaporator Outlet Temperature Unit <x> [C]

### Chiller Heater Evaporator Mass Flow Rate Unit <x> [C]

These outputs are the evaporator water inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rate. Note that these represent the chilled water temperatures and flow rate in cooling mode or the source water temperature and flow rate in heating mode.

### Chiller Heater Condenser Inlet Temperature Unit <x> [C]

### Chiller Heater Condenser Outlet Temperature Unit <x> [C]

### Chiller Heater Condenser Mass Flow Rate Unit <x> [C]

These outputs are the condenser water inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rate. Note that these represent the hot water temperatures and flow rate in heating mode or the source water temperature and flow rate in cooling mode.

### Chiller Heater COP Unit <x> [C]

This output is the coefficient of performance for the chiller-heater. It is calculated as the evaporator heat transfer rate divided by the chiller-heater electric power.

### Chiller Heater Capacity Temperature Modifier Multiplier Unit <x> [C]

This is the output of the curve object Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve.

### Chiller Heater EIR Temperature Modifier Multiplier Unit <x> [C]

This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve.

### Chiller Heater EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier Unit <x> [C]

This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve.

## Thermal Storage Objects

There are four types of cold thermal storage objects:

- ThermalStorage:Ice:Simple
- ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed
- ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed
- ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified

These objects are typically placed on the supply side of a primary chilled water loop in series or in parallel with one or more chillers.  Using the the component set point ([PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint](#plantequipmentoperationcomponentsetpoint)) plant operation scheme type, the chiller and storage tank setpoints are used to control operation. Using a [SetpointManager:Scheduled](#setpointmanagerscheduled) object (or other appropriate type of set point manager), the setpoints on the chiller outlet node and the ice storage outlet node can be used to control how the cooling load is shared and when charging of storage occurs.  Example setpoints to use for various modes of operation are shown in the table below:

Mode|Chiller Setpoint|Storage Setpoint
----|----------------|----------------
Charging ice storage tank|-5C|7C
Cooling with chiller only|7C|99C
Cooling with chiller and storage(fully load chiller before using storage))|7C|7C
Cooling with chiller and storage (chiller carries portion of load, valid if chiller is upstream of storage)|10C|7C

Example files have been developed for three common storage configurations:

#. Series â€“ Chiller Upstream:  In this configuration, a chiller is placed first on the same branch as the storage unit and both use the **SeriesActive** branch control type.
#. Series â€“ Chiller Downstream:  In this configuration, a chiller is placed second on the same branch as the storage unit and both use the **SeriesActive** branch control type.
#. Parallel:  In this configuration, the chiller is on a branch parallel to the storage unit branch when it is not charging.  During charging mode, valves will be changed so that the chiller is in series upstream of the storage.  To accomplish this in EnergyPlus, the chiller must be modeled using two different chiller objects to represent the same chiller.  One chiller object on a parallel branch operates only when storage is not being charged.  The other chiller object, in series upstream of the storage unit operates only during charging mode.

Other considerations for applying cold thermal storage objects include:

- In the [PlantLoop](#plantloop) object, the "Minimum Loop Temperature" must be set equal to or less than the lowest setpoint to be used anywhere in the loop.
- To end the storage charging cycle, use a [AvailabilityManager:LowTemperatureTurnOff](#availabilitymanagerlowtemperatureturnoff) to shut off the primary chilled water loop when the temperature leaving the storage tank nears the charging mode chiller setpoint indicating that the tank is fully charged.  For example, if the chiller is set to provide â€“5C chilled water during charging, then charging can be shut down when the water temperature leaving the storage unit reaches â€“4C.  When using a primary-secondary loop arrangement, it may be necessary to schedule this availability manager to be active only when the HVAC systems are off to avoid fighting between the demand controls and the availability manager.

## ThermalStorage:Ice:Simple

This thermal storage model is based on a simple simulation of an ice storage tank with a fixed capacity.  The tank is charged, or frozen, in an ice-on-coil configuration where ice builds up on the outside of the tubes carrying the brine or glycol solution from the chiller.  There are two discharge (melt) options, internal or external.  Internal melt uses the same fluid tubes for charging and discharging.  External melt uses a separate fluid path for discharge such that the outer layers of ice melt first.  The ice storage model includes an implied 3-way valve to control the amount if charge/discharge based on the incoming water temperature and the outlet node setpoint temperature.  The storage tank is assumed to be fully charged (full of ice) at the beginning of each environment.  The tank is then allowed to charge and discharge during the warmup days of the environment.  The tank is best controlled using the [PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint](#plantequipmentoperationcomponentsetpoint) plant operation scheme, and requires that a setpoint be placed by a set point manager on the ice storage Plant Outlet Node.

The input fields for the object are described in detail below:

## ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed

The detailed ice storage model allows the users of EnergyPlus to model more closely specific manufacturers' ice storage units. This is possible due to the use of curve fits to simulate the performance of the ice storage unit during charging and discharging. In this implementation, both charging and discharging are a function of the fraction charged/discharged as well as the log mean temperature difference across the storage unit. More information on the model is provided in the Engineering Reference for EnergyPlus. The remainder of this section describes the input required for the detailed ice storage model and the output that it can produce.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

This field is the name of the detailed ice storage system given to it by the user.

#### Field: Availability Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that determines whether or not the ice storage system is available during a particular time period. This allows the system to be turned off during a particular season. A value of less than or equal to zero indicates that the ice storage system is not available. Any value greater than zero indicates that the system is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Capacity

This number is the maximum amount of latent thermal storage available in the ice storage system. This model does not allow the removal or addition of sensible energy from the tank. Thus, it is always assumed to be at the freezing temperature of the storage material. The capacity is expressed in units of GJ.

#### Field: Inlet Node Name

This is the name of the node that connects the ice storage system to the plant loop. It is the inlet node to the ice storage component. The next field defines the outlet node. Due to presence of an internal bypass in this model, there are other "nodes" that are handled internally within the program. Users do not need to define any nodes other than the inlet and outlet nodes.

#### Field: Outlet Node Name

This is the name of the other node that connects the ice storage system to the plant loop. It is the outlet node to the ice storage component.

#### Field: Discharging Curve Object Type

The detailed ice storage model in EnergyPlus takes advantage of the Curve feature of the program. Currently, the only two allowed curve fit types for the detailed ice storage model are the QuadraticLinear and the CubicLinear curves. More information on this curve can be found in the section on Curves.

#### Field: Discharging Curve Name

This field specifies the name of the actual curve fit to be used to model the discharging process of the detailed ice storage system.

#### Field: Charging Curve Object Type

The detailed ice storage model in EnergyPlus takes advantage of the Curve feature of the program. Currently, the only two allowed curve fit types for the detailed ice storage model are the QuadraticLinear and the CubicLinear curves. More information on this curve can be found in the section on Curves.

#### Field: Charging Curve Name

This field specifies the name of the actual curve fit to be used to model the charging process of the detailed ice storage system.

#### Field: Timestep of the Curve Data

This field defines what timestep was used to produce the curve fits named in the previous inputs. This parameter is important because the curve fit is non-dimensional. Thus, the data used to develop the curve fits were based on a specific length of time. In many cases, this is probably one hour or 1.0. The units for this parameter are hours.

#### Field: Parasitic Electric Load During Discharging

This field defines the amount of parasitic electric consumption (for controls or other miscellaneous electric consumption associate with the ice storage unit itself) during the discharge phase. This parameter is dimensionless and gets multiplied by the current load on the tank.

#### Field: Parasitic Electric Load During Charging

This field defines the amount of parasitic electric consumption (for controls or other miscellaneous electric consumption associate with the ice storage unit itself) during the charge phase. This parameter is dimensionless and gets multiplied by the current load on the tank.

#### Field: Tank Loss Coefficient

This field defines the loss of ice stored during a particular hour. This field is dimensionless (per hour). It is not multiplied by any temperature difference between the tank and the environment in which it might be located.

#### Field: Freezing Temperature of Storage Medium

This parameter defines the freezing/melting temperature of the ice storage medium in degrees Celsius. For most tanks, this is simply 0.0C (the default value). However, some tanks may use other materials or salts which would change the freezing temperature. This can be changed using this parameter.

#### Field: Thaw Process Indicator 

This input field assists in more accurate modeling of the charging process by defining how the thawing of ice takes place. There are two options for this input: **InsideMelt** and **OutsideMelt**. Some ice storage systems, by their nature, start the charging process with a bare coil or no ice left on the charging surface even though there is still ice stored in the tank.  An example of such a system is sometimes referred to as an ice-on-coil inside melt system, and these systems would define this parameter using the "InsideMelt" option for this field.  Other systems melt the ice from the outside, leaving ice still on the charging surface when charging begins. These systems are modeled using the "OutsideMelt" option.  For systems that have a charging process that does not vary significantly with fraction charged can ignore this input by accepting the default value.  The default value for this field is "OutsideMelt".

## ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed

The [ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed](#thermalstoragechilledwatermixed) object analytically solves the differential equation governing the energy balance of the water tank.  The chilled water is "used" by drawing from the "Use Side" of the water tank.  The tank is indirectly charged by circulating cold water through the "Source Side" of the water tank.

Control is based on cycling flow through the source side.  When the tank temperature rises above a "cut-in" temperature, source side flow is requested.  Source side flow will continue until the tank is cooled to below the tank set point or "cut-out" temperature.

For heat gains from the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, the skin gains are removed from the zone heat balance as negative internal heat gains.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

The unique name of the [ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed](#thermalstoragechilledwatermixed) object.

#### Field: Tank Volume

The volume of the thermal storage tank [m^3^].

#### Field: Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name

#### Field: Deadband Temperature Difference

The delta temperature difference [Î”Â°C] between the setpoint and the "cut-in" temperature at which the storage tank will request cooling. In other words, the "cut-in" temperature is Setpoint + Deadband.

#### Field: Minimum Temperature Limit

The temperature [Â°C] at which the tank water becomes too cold.  No source side flow is allowed when the tank temperature is below this limit.  The minimum temperature must be lower than the setpoint temperature at all times.

#### Field: Nominal Cooling Capacity

This field describes the typical cooling capacity that the chilled water tank will provide.  Since this is a passive device, the actual cooling capacity depends on water temperatures and flow rates.  However, this field is used to describe the chilled water tank's nominal cooling capacity for supervisory control where plant operation schemes require a cooling capacity to model how equipment is dispatched.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Indicator

## ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified

The [ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified](#thermalstoragechilledwaterstratified) object divides the water tank into multiple nodes of equal volume. The nodes are coupled by vertical conduction effects, internode fluid flow, and temperature inversion mixing. The object simultaneously solves the differential equations governing the energy balances on the nodes using a numerical method. The system timestep is divided into many small substeps that allow the simulation to capture events that occur on a very short time scale.  The chilled water is "used" by drawing from the "Use Side" of the water tank.  The tank is indirectly charged by circulating cold water through the "Source Side" of the water tank.

Control is based on cycling flow through the source side.  When the tank temperature rises above a "cut-in" temperature, source side flow is requested.  Source side flow will continue until the tank is cooled to below the tank set point or "cut-out" temperature.

For heat gains from the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, the skin gains are removed from the zone heat balance as negative internal heat gains.
