# Group â€“ Compliance Objects

Not necessarily related directly to simulation, the Compliance Object group provides a repository for a group of objects that can be used directly or indirectly in reporting compliance (such as ASHRAE 90.1) to building standards.

## Compliance:Building

The [Compliance:Building](#compliancebuilding) object describes parameters related to compliance to building standards, building codes, and beyond energy code programs.

### Inputs

#### Field: Building Rotation for Appendix G

[Building](#building) Rotation for Appendix G allows for the building model to be rotated for use with compliance such as ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. Appendix G requires the building to be rotated 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees and the values averaged to establish baseline energy use. This input works with relative or world coordinate systems.
