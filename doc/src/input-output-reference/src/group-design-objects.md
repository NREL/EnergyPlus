## Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing

### Overview

In order for EnergyPlus to successfully calculate zone design heating and cooling loads and air flow rates and for the program to use these results to automatically size the HVAC components a number of input objects must be present and certain object input fields must be entered.

- *The input file should contain a* SimulationControl object. The 1^st^ field *Do [Zone](#zone) Sizing Calculation* should be entered as *Yes*. This will cause a zone sizing simulation to be done using all the sizing periods in the input file as weather. If there are no air or water loops in the HVAC input fields 2 and 3 can be set to *No.* If there are one or more air loops (i.e., there is at least one [AirLoopHVAC](#airloophvac) object in the input file) then the 2^nd^ field *Do System Sizing Calculation* should be entered as *Yes*. If there are one or more water loops (Plant Loop objects) then the 3^rd^ field *Do Plant Sizing Calculation* should be set to *Yes*. Finally either the 4^th^ field (*Run Simulation for Sizing Periods*) or the 5^th^ field (*Run Simulation for Weather File Run Periods*) should be set to *Yes* in order to autosize the components and do a real simulation using the autosized components. The component autosizing calculations are done on the first pass through the HVAC system in the real simulation.
- *There must be at least 2 (up to any number)* SizingPeriod objects present. Normally one will be for summer conditions and one for winter. The summer day should normally have the field *Day Type* set to *SummerDesignDay*. The winter design day should normally have *Day Type* set to *WinterDesignDay*.
- *To apply a global sizing factor include the* Sizing:Parameters object.
- *For each controlled zone in the input file there should be a corresponding* Sizing:[Zone](#zone) object. Similarly for each [AirLoopHVAC](#airloophvac) there should be a [Sizing:System](#sizingsystem) object. And for each Plant or Condenser Loop there should be a [Sizing:Plant](#sizingplant) object. Note however that if a controlled zone has no corresponding [Zone](#zone) Sizing object the data from the first [Zone](#zone) Sizing object will be used. Thus if all the zone sizing information is the same only one [Zone](#zone) Sizing object need be entered.
- Only controlled zones are included in the zone and system sizing calculations. Thus for a design air flow rate to be calculated for a zone, it must contain a thermostat *even though it might not need or have a thermostat in the full simulation*. An illustration would be a three zone building with a packaged single zone system and a thermostat in one of the zones. In order for the two slave zones to be included in the design air flow calculations they must be treated as if they have a thermostat: there must be a [ZoneControl:Thermostat](#zonecontrolthermostat) for each of the slave zones.
- Some attention should be paid to schedules. In a weekly schedule object the 9^th^ and 10^th^ day schedules are for summer and winter design days respectively. This means that if a SizingPeriod object has field *Day Type* set to *SummerDesignDay*  the day schedule for summer sizing periods will be in effect. Similarly if a SizingPeriod object has field *Day Type* set to *WinterDesignDay*  the day schedule for winter sizing periods will be in effect. Some possible applications of this capability are:

        #. setting internal loads (lights, equipment, occupancy) to maximum all day for cooling and to zero all day for heating;
        #. setting heating and cooling thermostat set points to constant values (no set up or set back);
        #. setting heating and cooling equipment to be always on.

None of these applications are necessarily recommended but these and other uses of the special summer/winter design day schedules may prove useful for specific situations.

- Other than zone thermostat setpoints, the sizing calculations generally know nothing about the system control inputs such as setpoints and availability schedules. The user must coordinate sizing inputs with the actual simulation control inputs.
- The sizing calculations only recognize the presence of central heating and cooling coils, preheat and precool coils and reheat coils. These are assumed to deliver the various supply temperatures specified in the [Sizing:System](#sizingsystem) and [Sizing:Zone](#sizingzone) objects. The impact of ther components such as heat recovery, dehumidifiers, fans, and pumps are not accounted for in the sizing calculations.

### Component Autosizing

For autosizing to occur at the component level the user must enter the special value *autosize* in the numeric fields for which autosizing is available. Those fields can be found by looking at the Energy+.idd data dictionary file or under individual object details in this document. Fields that can be autosized are denoted with the comment *\\autosizable*. The components and fields that are autosizable are listed in the following table. Note that spaces may be inserted in object names to facilitate readability.

There are 3 places in the input where the user can impose sizing factors.

In Sizing Parameters (object: [Sizing:Parameters](#sizingparameters)), the user can specify an over-all sizing factor. This factor is applied to all the zone design loads and air flow rates resulting from the zone sizing calculations.

In [Zone](#zone) Sizing (object: Sizing:[Zone](#zone)), the user can specify a sizing factor for a specific zone. The factor is applied to the calculated zone design loads and air flow rates for the zone named in the Sizing:[Zone](#zone) object. This sizing factor overrides the global sizing factor. That is, a zone sizing factor, if specified, replaces the global sizing factor for the named zone.

For some plant components (basically all central chillers, boilers and cooling towers) the user can specify a sizing factor that modifies the autosized component capacity and flow rates. These factors are applied after the application of global or zone sizing factors. They are primarily used to split the design load between multiple components. These sizing factors can change the autosizing of the associated loops and pumps. The following rules are followed the effect of plant component sizing factors on loops and pumps.

For supply side branches, the sizing factors of all components in series on the branch are summed and the result becomes the branch sizing factor. If there is a branch pump its autosized design flow rate is multiplied by the branch sizing factor.

For each loop, if the average of the branch sizing factors is less than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the sum of the branch sizing factors. If the average is greater than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the maximum of the branch sizing factors. The loop sizing factor is applied to the loop design flow rate (if autosized) and to the loop pump flow rate (if autosized).

### Mixing User-Specified and Autosized Inputs 

Mixed user-specified and autosized inputs can be successfully used if the following points and suggestions are followed.

Each component is autosized independently. Thus user input for a flow rate in one component will have no effect on other components' autosized flow rates. For instance, specifying the chilled water loop pump's rated flow rate will have no effect on the autosizing of the chiller's design evaporator flow rate or on the plant loop's autosized maximum loop flow rate.

Within a component it is best to autosize all inputs are enter specified values for all inputs. For example, in a chiller, if only the nominal capaciity is user-specified, the autosized chilled water flow rate may not be consistent with the specified capacity.

Sizing information flows only from the sizing objects to the components. The sizing calculations have no knowledge of user-specified values in a component. The only exception to this rule is that plant loop sizing will collect all component design water flow rates whether autosized or user-specified.

If the user wants to specify a zone or system air flow rate it should be done using the [Sizing:Zone](#sizingzone) and [Sizing:System](#sizingsystem)  objects rather than done in the individual components.

The plant loop flow rates are sized from the total design demand of the components connected to each loop. The components demanding water need not be autosized for the plant loop autosizing to work successfully. So the user could specify all the air side components and autosize all the plant loops and plant components. Or specify the chilled water loop flow rate, chilled water pump inputs and chiller inputs and let the condenser loop and tower autosize.

### Component Sizing Output

The results of the component autosizing calculations are reported on the *eplusout.eio* file. For each component field that has been autosized the object type, object name, field description with unit, and value are printed out as comma separated data on a line beginning with *Component Sizing*. Examples of this are shown in the Output Details and Examples document.

The complete list of objects that have autosized fields is shown in the following table. Note that spaces may be inserted in object names to facilitate readability.

### User or External Zone Design Flow Rate Inputs

In EnergyPlus the autosizing calculations start with a calculation of the zone design air flow rates using zone by zone design day simulations. The resulting zone design air flow rates and daily air flow sequences are used in the subsequent HVAC and central plant air and fluid flow design calculations and in the component autosizing calculations. The user can override or change the calculated zone design air flow rates in several ways.

#. The user can enter a value for *Sizing Factor* in the *Sizing:Parameters* object (see description below).
#. The user can specify a zone level *Zone Sizing Factor* in each *Sizing:Zone* object.
#. For each zone the user can input a *Cooling Design Air Flow Rate* and/or a *Heating Design Air Flow Rate* (and specify *Cooling Design Air Flow Method = Flow/Zone* and *Heating Design Air Flow Method = Flow/Zone*). These user inputs override the calculated values. The program divides the user input cooling or heating design air flow rate by the calculated values and uses the result as a zone sizing factor to multiply all the elements in the design heating and cooling air flow and load sequences. From this point the design calculations proceed as usual.

### User or External System Design Flow Rate Inputs

Using the results of the zone design air flow rate calculation (including any user input or altered flow rates) EnergyPlus proceeds to calculate central air system flow rates and cooling and heating loads. The results of this calculation can be overridden in the following way.

For each system ([AirLoopHVAC](#airloophvac)), in the corresponding [Sizing:System](#sizingsystem) object, specify *Cooling Design Air Flow Method* to be *Flow/System* and input a value for *Cooling Design Air Flow Rate*. **Similarly for heating specify *Heating Design Air Flow Method* to be *Flow/System* and input a value for *Heating Design Air Flow Rate*.

## DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir

This object allows for the outdoor air requirements to be defined in a common location for use by other objects. This object may be referenced by name from other objects (e.g., VAV terminal units) as required to identify an outdoor air quantity for use by that object. Note that a zone name Is not included as an input to this zone outdoor air definition and the number of people in a zone, zone floor area, and zone volume can only be determined after this object has been referenced by another. A single zone outdoor air definition may be referenced by multiple objects to specify that the same outdoor air requirements are used by those objects *or* multiple zone outdoor air objects may be defined and referenced by other objects as needed. If multiple zone outdoor air definitions are used, each outdoor air definition must have a unique name.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

Unique identifying name. Any reference to this name by other objects will denote that the following outdoor air requirements will be used.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Method

The input must be either *Flow/Person*, *Flow/Area*, *Flow/[Zone](#zone), AirChanges/Hour*, *Sum*, or *Maximum*. *Flow/Person* means the program will use the input from the field *Outdoor Air Flow per Person* and the actual zone occupancy to calculate a zone outdoor air flow rate. *Flow/Area* means that the program will use the input from the field *Outdoor Air Flow per [Zone](#zone) Floor Area* and the actual zone floor area as the zone outdoor air flow rate. *Flow/[Zone](#zone)* means that the program will use the input of the field *Outdoor Air Flow per [Zone](#zone)* as the zone outdoor air flow rate. *AirChanges/Hour* means that the program will use the input from the field *Air Changes per Hour* and the actual zone volume (divided by 3600 seconds per hour) as the zone outdoor air flow rate. *Sum* means that the flows calculated from the fields *Outdoor Air Flow per Person,* *Outdoor Air Flow per Area, Outdoor Air Flow per [Zone](#zone)*, and *Air Changes per Hour* (using the associated conversions to m^3^/s for each field) will be added to obtain the zone outdoor air flow rate. *Maximum* means that the maximum flow derived from *Outdoor Air Flow per Person,* *Outdoor Air Flow per Area, Outdoor Air Flow per [Zone](#zone),* and *Air Changes per Hour* (using the associated conversions to m^3^/s for each field) will be used as the zone outdoor air flow rate. The default is *Flow/Person*.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Person

The design outdoor air volume flow rate per person for this zone in cubic meters per second per person. The default is 0.00944 (20 cfm per person). An outdoor air flow rate is calculated based on the total number of people for all [People](#people) statements assigned to the zone. Occupancy schedule values *are not* applied during sizing calculations and *are* applied during the remainder of the simulation. This input is used if *Outdoor Air Method* is one of *Outdoor Air Flow per Person*, *Sum*, or *Maximum*.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area

The design outdoor air volume flow rate per square meter of floor area (units are m^3^/s-m^2^). This input is used if *Outdoor Air Method* is *Flow/Area, Sum* or *Maximum*. The default value for this field is 0.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Zone

The design outdoor air flow rate for this zone in cubic meters per second. This input field is used if *Outdoor Air Method* is *Flow/Zone, Sum* or *Maximum*. The default value for this field is 0.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow Changes per Hour

The design outdoor air volume flow rate in air changes per hour. This factor is used along with the [Zone](#zone) Volume and converted to cubic meters per second. This input field is used if *Outdoor Air Method* is *AirChanges/Hour, Sum* or *Maximum*. The default value for this field is 0.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow Rate Fraction Schedule Name

This field is the name of schedule that defines how outdoor air requirements change over time.  The field is optional.  If used, then the schedule values are multiplied by the outdoor air flow rate defined by the previous fields.  The schedule values must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.

## DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution

This object is used to describe the air distribution effectiveness and fraction of secondary recirculation air (return air not directly mixed with outdoor air) of a zone. It is referenced by the [Sizing:Zone](#sizingzone) and [Controller:MechanicalVentilation](#controllermechanicalventilation) objects.

### Inputs

#### *Field:* Name 

The unique user assigned name for an instance of this object. Any other object referencing this object will use this name.

#### *Field: Zone Air Distribution E*ffectiveness in Cooling Mode 

The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in cooling mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values.

#### *Field: Zone Air Distribution E*ffectiveness in Heating Mode 

The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in heating mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values as follows:

![Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness (Source: ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010)](media/zone-air-distribution-effectiveness-source.png)


#### *Field: Zone Air Distribution* Effectiveness Schedule Name 

This optional field input points to a schedule with values of zone air distribution effectiveness. It provides a more flexible way of specifying zone air distribution effectiveness if it changes with time and/or system operating status and controls. If the schedule is specified, the zone air distribution effectiveness in cooling mode and heating mode will be ignored.

#### *Field: Zone Secon*dary Recirculation Fraction 

The non-negative numeric input for this field is the fraction of a zone's recirculation air that does not directly mix with the outdoor air. The zone secondary recirculation fraction Er is determined by the designer based on system configuration. For plenum return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with plenum return) Er is usually less than 1.0, although values may range from 0.1 to 1.2 depending upon the location of the ventilation zone relative to other zones and the air handler. For ducted return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with ducted return), Er is typically 0.0, while for those with system-level recirculation (e.g, dual-fan dual-duct systems with ducted return) Er is typically 1.0. For other system types, Er is typically 0.75. Minimum is 0.0, and default is 0.0 for single-path systems (also to maintain backward compatibility). For parallel fan-powered VAV systems, the secondary ventilation path only functions (Er > 0.0) when the fans in the VAV boxes operate, which is during heating. The local ventilation path and the benefits of secondary recirculation disappear during cooling, when the local parallel fans are off (Er = 0.0).

An example of this in an IDF context is shown:

## Sizing:Parameters

This object allows the user to specify global heating and cooling sizing ratios. These ratios will be applied at the zone level to all of the zone heating and cooling loads and air flow rates. These new loads and air flow rates are then used to calculate the system level flow rates and capacities and are used in all component sizing calculations.

The user can also specify the width (in load timesteps) of a moving average window which can be used to smooth the calculated zone design flow sequences. The use of this parameter is described below.

### Inputs

#### Field: Heating Sizing Factor

The global heating sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design heating loads and air flow rates.

#### Field: Cooling Sizing Factor

The global cooling sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design cooling loads and air flow rates

#### Field: Timesteps in Averaging Window

The number of load timesteps in the zone design flow sequence averaging window. The default is 1, in which case the calculated zone design flow rates are averaged over the load timestep.

The zone design air flow rate calculation is performed assuming a potentially infinite supply of heating or cooling air at a fixed temperature. Thus the calculated design air flow rate will always be able to meet any load or change in load no matter how large or abrupt. In reality air flow rates are limited by duct sizes and fan capacities. The idealized zone design flow calculation may result in unrealistically large flow rates, especially if the user is performing the sizing calculations using thermostat schedules with night setup or setback. The calculated zone design flow rates are always averaged over the load timestep. The user may want to perform a broader average to mitigate the effect of thermostat setup and setback and prevent the warm up or cool down flow rates from dominating the design flow rate calculation.. Specifying the width of the averaging window allows the user to do this.

For example, if the load calculation timestep is 15 minutes and the user specifies the *Timesteps in Averaging [Window](#window)* to be 4, the zone design air flows will be averaged over a time period of 1 hour. Specifying 8 would result in averaging over a 2 hour period.

### Outputs

The sizing factors and the averaging window size are reported out on the *eplusout.eio* file. An example is:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ! <Load Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation Averaging Window>, Value
     Timesteps in Averaging Window,    1

## OutputControl:Sizing:Style 

As described early in the document (see: EnergyPlus Output Processing), the user may select the "style" for the sizing result files (epluszsz.<ext>, eplusssz.<ext>). This object applies to all sizing output files.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    OutputControl:Sizing:Style,
           \memo default style for the Sizing output files is comma -- this works well for
           \memo importing into spreadsheet programs such as Excel(tm) but not so well for word

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Inputs

#### Field: Column Separator

For this field, the desired separator for columns is entered. "Comma" creates comma separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.csv files are created). "Tab" creates tab separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.tab files are created). "Fixed" creates space separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.txt files are created) but these are not necessarily lined up for easy printing.

Note that both tab and comma separated files easily import into Excelâ„¢ or other spreadsheet programs. The tab delimited files can also be viewed by text editors, word processing programs and easily converted to "tables" within those programs.

## Sizing:Zone

The [Sizing:Zone](#sizingzone) object provides the data needed to perform a zone design air flow calculation for a single zone. This calculation assumes a variable amount of supply air at a fixed temperature and humidity. The information needed consists of the zone inlet supply air conditions: temperature and humidity ratio for heating and cooling. The calculation is done for every design day included in the input. The maximum cooling load and air flow and the maximum heating load and air flow are then saved for the system level design calculations and for the component automatic sizing calculations.

The [Sizing:Zone](#sizingzone) object is also the place where the user can specify the design outdoor air flow rate by referencing the name of a design specification outdoor air object. This can be specified in a number of ways (ref. DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir).This data is saved for use in the system sizing calculation or for sizing zone components that use outdoor air.

The user can also place limits on the heating and design cooling air flow rates. See  *Heating Design Air Flow Method* and *Cooling Design Air Flow Method* below and the explanations of the various heating and cooling flow input fields.

### Outputs

The zone design air flow rates and loads are output onto the local file "epluszsz.<ext>" where <ext> is the extension from the sizing style object (default is csv â€“ a comma separated file *epluszsz.csv)*. The columns are clearly labeled. It will easily import into Excel or other spreadsheet program that accepts delimited files. All of these values are design air flow rates and loads *calculated by the program*. No sizing factors have been applied.

The calculated zone design air flow rates and the user input or altered zone design air flow rates are also reported on the *eplusout.eio* file. The values are printed out for each zone as comma separated records beginning with *Zone Sizing*. Items output on the *eio* file are: zone name, load type (heating or cooling), design load, calculated design air flow rate, user design air flow rate, design day name, time of peak, outside temperature at peak, outside humidity ratio at peak.

## Sizing:System

The [Sizing:System](#sizingsystem) object contains the input needed to perform a central forced air system design air flow, heating capacity, and cooling capacity calculation for a system serving one or more zones. The information needed consists of the outside environmental conditions and the design supply air temperatures, outdoor air flow rate, and minimum system air flow ratio.

The outside conditions come from the design days in the input. A system sizing calculation is performed for every design day in the input file and the resulting maximum heating and cooling air flow rates and capacities are saved for use in the component sizing calculations.

Supply air conditions are specified by inputting a supply air temperature for cooling, a supply air temperature for heating, and a preheat temperature.

The system sizing calculation sums the zone design air flow rates to obtain a system supply air flow rate. The design conditions and the outdoor air flow rate are used to calculate a design mixed air temperature. The temperature plus the design supply air temperatures allows the calculation of system design heating and cooling capacities.

### Inputs

#### Field: AirLoop Name

#### Field: Design Outdoor Air Flow Rate

The design outdoor air flow rate in cubic meters per second. Generally this should be the minimum outdoor air flow. It is used for both heating and cooling design calculations. The assumption for cooling is that any outdoor air economizer will be closed. If *Autosize* is input the outdoor air flow rate will be taken from the sum of the zone outdoor air flow rates or calculated based on the System Outdoor Air Method selection (field below).

#### Field: Minimum System Air Flow Ratio

This ratio is used in calculating the central system heating capacity. Thus if the system is VAV with the zone VAV dampers held at minimum flow when there is a zone heating demand, this ratio should be set to the minimum flow ratio. If the zone VAV dampers are reverse action and can open to full flow to meet heating demand, this ratio should be set to 1.

The calculated system design air flow rates and the user input system design air flow rates are also reported on the *eplusout.eio* file. The values are printed out for each system as comma separated records beginning with *System Sizing*. An example is:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ! <System Sizing Information>, System Name, Field Description, Value
     System Sizing, VAV SYS 1, Calculated Cooling Design Air Flow Rate [m3/s],   1.3194
     System Sizing, VAV SYS 1, User Cooling Design Air Flow Rate [m3/s],   1.5000
     System Sizing, VAV SYS 1, Calculated Heating Design Air Flow Rate [m3/s],  0.90363
     System Sizing, VAV SYS 1, User Heating Design Air Flow Rate [m3/s],   1.0000

## Sizing:Plant

The [Sizing:Plant](#sizingplant) object contains the input needed for the program to calculate plant loop flow rates and equipment capacities when autosizing. This information is initially used by components that use water for heating or cooling such as hot or chilled water coils to calculate their maximum water flow rates. These flow rates are then summed for use in calculating the Plant Loop flow rates.

The program will size any number of chilled water, hot water, condenser water and other plant loops. There should be one [Sizing:Plant](#sizingplant) object for each plant loop that is to be autosized.

### Inputs

#### Field: Plant or Condenser Loop Name

The name of a Plant Loop or Condenser Loop object corresponding to this [Sizing:Plant](#sizingplant) object. This is the plant loop for which this data will be used for calculating the loop flow rate.

#### Field: Loop Type

The possible inputs are *Heating, Steam, Cooling,* or *Condenser*.

#### Field: Design Loop Exit Temperature

The water temperature in degrees Celsius at the exit of the supply side of the plant loop, Thus this is the temperature of the water supplied to the inlet of chilled or hot water coils and other equipment that places loads on a plant loop.

#### Field: Loop Design Temperature Difference

The design temperature rise (for cooling or condenser loops) or fall (for heating loops) in degrees Celsius across the demand side of a plant loop.  This temperature difference is used by component models to determine flow rates required to meet design capacities.  Larger values lead to smaller design flow rates.

An IDF example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Sizing:Plant,
       Chilled Water Loop, ! name of loop
       Cooling,            ! type of loop
       7.22,               ! chilled water supply temperature
       6.67;               ! chilled water delta T
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Outputs

The loop flow rates are reported on the *eplusout.eio* file along with the component sizing results.
