# Group â€“ Evaporative Coolers

This group of objects describes the properties and configuration for the evaporative coolers models for the HVAC section.

## EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad

The direct stage, shown in the figure below, consists of a rigid media evaporative pad, with water recirculated from a reservoir.  The water is pumped from the reservoir to a water distribution header, for water feed by gravity from above the media.  The evaporative pad provides the area for the adiabatic saturation of the air.  While the process provides a lower dry-bulb temperature, the moisture content of the leaving air is higher than the entering condition.  The direct stage is used for comfort cooling in a building where adding humidity to the air can be tolerated.

![Direct Stage Evaporative Cooler](media/direct-stage-evaporative-cooler.png)


The thermodynamic process is a simultaneous heat and mass transfer, or adiabatic cooling, and follows a constant enthalpy line on the psychrometric chart, it is shown in the figure below as a process from A to B.  Since the deviation of the constant wet-bulb line and the constant enthalpy line is small, it is assumed that the wet-bulb temperature is constant across the direct evaporative stage.

![Psychrometric Chart -- Constant Enthalpy](media/psychrometric-chart-constant-enthalpy.png)


If the direct evaporative process were 100% efficient, the leaving dry-bulb temperature would equal the entering wet-bulb temperature.  The efficiency of the direct evaporative process is less than 100% and by defining saturation efficiency (![](media/image402.png) se) for the direct stage or evaporative pad, the leaving dry-bulb temperature can be expressed by the following equation.

## EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad

The dry coil indirect evaporative cooler, shown in the figure below, has a rigid media pad, similar to the direct evaporative stage, where the adiabatic cooling takes place. The secondary air leaves the rigid media pad and enters an air to air heat exchanger where it cools the supply air flowing through the heat exchanger tubes. The moist secondary air is then exhausted to the environment. The secondary air stream has its own fan and consists of a rigid media evaporative pad, with water recirculated from a reservoir. The water is pumped from the reservoir to a water distribution header, for water feed by gravity from above the media. The evaporative pad provides the area for the adiabatic saturation of the air.

![Evaporative Cooler -- Indirect Dry Coil](media/evaporative-cooler-indirect-dry-coil.png)


The process that the secondary air goes through, A to C to D, is shown by the dashed lines in  the following figure. Process A to C is adiabatic cooling in the rigid media pad. Then the air enters the shell side of the heat exchanger and is sensibly heated from C to D by the warm supply air passing through the tube side. The secondary air inlet is modeled as a separate stream of outdoor air and the user has the option of defining the name of an outdoor air node.

![Secondary Air Process -- Indirect Dry Coil Evap Cooler](media/secondary-air-process-indirect-dry-coil-evap.png)


The advantage of the dry coil heat exchanger is that the heat exchanger does not have the evaporation taking place on the outside of the tubes, thus no mineral deposits are left on the heat exchange surface to reduce the efficiency of the heat exchanger. The rigid media pads are designed to flush the mineral deposits to the sump, so the saturation efficiency of the pad stays relatively constant.

#### Evaporative Cooler Wetbulb Effectiveness

In other words, it is a measure of the approach to the outdoor wet-bulb temperature.

#### Evaporative Cooler Total Stage Effectiveness

## EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil

The wetted coil evaporative cooler shown in the figure below, has water sprayed directly on the tubes of the heat exchanger where latent cooling takes place. The vaporization of the water on the outside of the heat exchanger tubes allows the simultaneous heat and mass transfer which removes heat from the supply air on the tube side. Then the moist secondary air is exhausted. The secondary air stream has its own fan.

![Evaporative Cooler â€“ Indirect Wet Coil](media/evaporative-cooler-indirect-wet-coil.png)


The process that the secondary air goes through, A to C on the following figure, is a path of simultaneous heat and mass transfer, but it does not follow a line of constant enthalpy as in the direct stage. The process is not adiabatic due to the heat gain from the supply air flowing through the tubes of the heat exchanger.

![Secondary Air Process â€“ Indirect Wet Coil Evap Cooler](media/secondary-air-process-indirect-wet-coil-evap.png)


The wet coil heat exchanger can have a higher stage efficiency than the dry coil due to a higher heat transfer rate on the outside of the heat exchanger tubes. Over the operating lifetime of the heat exchanger, the vaporization taking place on the heat exchange surface can leave mineral deposits which will decrease the effectiveness of the heat exchanger.

#### Field: Coil Maximum Efficiency

The maximum efficiency of the stage is a combination of the efficiency due to the simultaneous heat and mass transfer on the outside of the tube and the efficiency of the heat exchanger. This value can be higher than the dry coil overall efficiency since the convective coefficients on the outside of the tube are larger.

A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the evaporative cooler can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Cooler Maximum Effectiveness

This field specifies the maximum effectiveness that is applied to the wetbulb depression to determine the conditions leaving the cooler. This effectiveness is a complicated function of the efficiency with which heat and mass are transferred on the secondary side and the efficiency of heat exchange between the secondary and primary flows. The model assumes that the effectiveness is constant.

#### Field: Cooler Flow Ratio

Not used in this model.

#### Field: Recirculating Water Pump Power Consumption

This field is used to specify the power consumed by the water pump that circulates water in Watts. The pump power and energy consumption is reduced by cycling when the amount of cooling needs to be restricted for control purposes.

#### Field: Secondary Fan Flow Rate

This field is used to specify the secondary fan flow rate and is specified in m^3^/s. This flow rate would typically be similar in magnitude to the flow through the primary side. This field can be autosized. When it is autosized, the program detects if the component is in the main air loop or on an outdoor air path.  If it is on the main air loop, then the flow rate is set to the [AirLoopHVAC](#airloophvac) system's design supply air flow rate (which is the maximum required for heating and cooling).  If it is on the outdoor air path, then the flow rate is set to the larger of either the design minimum outdoor air flow rate or one-half of the main air loop design flow rate. The flow rate is used to determine parasitic fan energy and does not impact the modeling of cooler effectiveness. The flow rate (and fan power) is effectively reduced by cycling when the amount of cooling needs to be restricted for control purposes.

#### Field: Secondary Fan Total Efficiency

This value is the overall efficiency of the fan, i.e., the ratio of the power delivered to the fluid to the electrical input power. It is the product of the motor efficiency and the impeller efficiency. The motor efficiency is the power delivered to the shaft divided by the electrical power input to the motor. The impeller efficiency is power delivered to the fluid (air) divided by the shaft power. The power delivered to the fluid is the mass flow rate of the air multiplied by the pressure rise divided by the air density. This input value must be between 0 and 1.

#### Field: Secondary Fan Delta Pressure

This field is used to specify the pressure difference in Pascals experienced by the secondary fan as it moves air through the wet side of the cooler.

#### Field: Primary Air Inlet Node Name

The name of the air inlet node for the primary air flow path through the cooler.

#### Field: Primary Air Outlet Node Name

The name of the air outlet node for the primary air flow path through the cooler.

#### Field: Control Type

This input field is not used by this model. But using this model does implement controlling of the primary outlet temperature.

#### Field: Dewpoint Effectiveness Factor

This field specifies an effectiveness that is applied to the dewpoint depression to determine a bound for the conditions leaving the cooler. The model uses the warmer of the two temperatures determined from wetbulb depression and dewpoint depression.

#### Field: Secondary Air Inlet Node Name

This field specifies the name of the node providing air to the secondary/wet side of the cooler. Typically this node could appear in an outdoor air node list or be part of an air system loop.

#### Field: Sensor Node Name

This field specifies the name of a node that will provide system air temperature setpoint information. A separate SetpointManager object should be setup to update this node.

#### Field: Relief Air Inlet Node Name

This field is optional, but can be used to feed two sources of secondary air into the wet side of the cooler. Typical use is to run the air system relief air into the system. The model first uses all of the air flow available from this node and then adds the air flow from the secondary air inlet node to make up the total defined by Secondary Fan Flow Rate.

#### Field: Water Supply Storage Tank Name

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However, if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains.

#### Field: Drift Loss Fraction

This field is optional and can be used to model additional water consumed by the cooler from drift.  Drift is water that leaves the cooling media as droplets and does not evaporate into the process air stream.  For example, water may get blown off the evaporative media by winds and escape the air system.  The value entered here is a simple fraction of the water consumed by the cooler for normal process evaporation.  The amount of drift is this fraction times the water evaporated for the normal cooling process.  This field can be left blank and then there will be no added water consumption from drift.

#### Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio

This field is optional and can be used to model additional water consumed by the cooler from blowdown.  Blowdown is water that is intentionally drained from the cooler's sump to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation.  The value entered here is dimensionless.  It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water.  Typical values are 3 to 5.  The default is 3.0.

#### Evaporative Cooler Total Stage Effectiveness []

The Total Stage Efficiency is defined as the temperature change of the supply air divided by the difference between the outdoor dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, including the effect of the reduction in flow because of the secondary air stream. In other words, it is a measure of the approach to the outdoor wet-bulb temperature.

#### Evaporative Cooler Part Load Ratio []

This output variable provides the part load fraction of the indirect cooler.  The ResearchSpecial cooler model is able to modulate to meet a temperature set point to avoid over cooling.  This output variable is the fraction formed by the ratio of the capacity needed over the maximum cooling capacity available.  A value of 1.0 corresponds to full capacity cooling.

#### Evaporative Cooler Dewpoint Bound Status []

This output variable is a flag that indicates if the modeling was based on dewpoint effectivenss rather than wetbulb effectiveness  The ResearchSpecial model is usually based on wet-bulb approach, but since values in excess of 1.0 are allowed, there is a secondary constraint imposed by dewpoint.  If the dewpoint effectiveness was applied, then this flag variable will have the value 1.0, otherwise it is 0.0.

#### Evaporative Cooler Electric Power [W]

#### Evaporative Cooler Electric Energy [J]

These output variables report the electric power and energy that are consumed by the secondary air fan and the sump pump.

#### Evaporative Cooler Water Volume [m3]

The water consumption is the water evaporated from the pad.  This water consumption is only from the direct thermodynamics of water evaporation and does not include other sources of consumption such as drift or concentration blow down.

#### Evaporative Cooler Starved Water Volume [m3]

This is the water consumed by the evaporative cooler that could not accually be met by the storage tank.  This output variable appears when storage tank water is supplied to the cooler.

#### Evaporative Cooler Starved Mains Water Volume [m3]

This is the source (mains) of water consumed by the evaporative cooler that could not accually be met by the storage tank.  This output variable appears when storage tank water is supplied to the cooler.
