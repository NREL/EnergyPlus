# Input-Output Reference

This document is intended to be an encyclopedic reference for the EnergyPlus Input Data Dictionary (IDD), Input Data File (IDF) and potential resultant outputs (various output files).

The following descriptions are "grouped" by the elements in the IDD (ref: Getting Started Document and the IDD Conventions). In some cases, the descriptions of reporting will be done for an object (e.g. Lighting electrical consumption or thermal comfort value for a group of people) and in some cases for the entire group (e.g., ambient condition reports).
