# Group â€“ Water Systems

This group of objects is used to describe the water systems in the building. EnergyPlus offers water modeling capabilities than include not only hot water systems but also the overall water systems including cold water uses, on-site water collection (e.g., from rain, condensate, or well), and storage. HVAC components may consume or collect a significant portion of the water making it appropriate to include water modeling in EnergyPlus.

All water systems are collected into an end use category called "Water Systems". This category includes hot and cold water. Water consumed by an HVAC component will be assigned to the end use category for that component. End use subcategories are available to separate hot water from cold water if desired. Simple hot water systems can be configured as stand-alone or use a [PlantLoop](#plantloop). The Water Systems can be connected to PlantLoops for modeling heated water end uses. However PlantLoops are not used to model cold water and the WaterUse:Storages portions of the water system. Cold water systems are connected together using [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) objects. [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) are used at the zone level to connect to both cold and hot water.

In addition to the input objects described in this section below, there are a variety of HVAC components that can be configured to interact with the water systems. These component input objects include optional fields that allow describing how the water systems are connected to them by providing the name of a storage tank. The following table lists EnergyPlus input objects that include provisions for connecting to the water systems but are described elsewhere in this document:

## WaterUse:Equipment

The [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) object is a generalized object for simulating all water end uses. Hot and cold water uses are included, as well as controlled mixing of hot and cold water at the tap. The [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) object can be used stand-alone, or coupled into a plant loop using the [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object (see below). The [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object allows water uses to be linked to [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) objects to store and draw reclaimed water. The [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object can also simulate drainwater heat recovery.

The [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) object serves all of the same purposes as the existing objects:  [Exterior:WaterEquipment](#exteriorwaterequipment), and [HotWaterEquipment](#hotwaterequipment).

The [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) object does a better job of modeling domestic hot water by allowing mixing at the tap in order to account for both hot **and cold** water used at sinks, showers, etc. It also improves on the stand-alone energy modeling of domestic hot water. Because all of the temperatures and flow rates can be solved, the energy usage can be accounted for as "Purchased Heating".

In either stand-alone mode or used with the [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object, the [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) object will attempt to meet a scheduled target temperature at the tap by mixing hot and cold water flows. If the hot water flow is not hot enough, or if the flow is limited by plant loop constraints, the result is a cooler mixed water temperature and the target temperature will not be met. In stand-alone mode the hot and cold water temperatures are specified by schedules. However, if the cold water schedule is omitted, the water temperature will be calculated by the [Site:WaterMainsTemperature](#sitewatermainstemperature) object. If the hot water schedule or target temperature schedule are omitted, all water is delivered as cold water. If only using cold water, the [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) object is similar to the [Exterior:WaterEquipment](#exteriorwaterequipment) object.

The [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) object improves on the internal gains object [HotWaterEquipment](#hotwaterequipment) by associating actual water usage with a sensible and latent gain to a zone. Equipment, such as showers, that generate a significant heat gain can be modeled using the Sensible Fraction Schedule and Latent Fraction Schedule fields. The schedules are used to set the fraction of the maximum possible heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that should be added to the zone. The split between sensible and latent will vary depending on the type of equipment that is to be modeled. Typically, both fractions should be small numbers.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

The unique object name for reference by other objects.

#### Field: End-Use Subcategory

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., "Laundry", "Dish Washing", etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: [Output:Meter](#outputmeter-and-outputmetermeterfileonly) objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table under the "Water Systems" end-use category. If this field is omitted or blank, the water use will be assigned to the "General" end-use subcategory.

#### Field: Peak Flow Rate

The peak demanded hot water flow rate [m^3^/s]. This value is multiplied by the Flow Rate Fraction Schedule (below) to determine the actual volumetric flow rate.

#### Field: Flow Rate Fraction Schedule Name

Reference to the schedule object specifying the flow rate fraction relative to the Peak Flow Rate (above). If blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0 at all times.

#### Field: Target Temperature Schedule Name

Reference to the schedule object specifying the target water temperature [C]. Hot and cold water are mixed at the tap to attain the target temperature. If insufficient hot water is available to reach the target temperature, the result is cooler water at the tap. If blank, the target temperature defaults to the hot water supply temperature.

#### Field: Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name

Reference to the schedule object specifying the hot water temperature [C]. The hot water temperature is used to calculate the "Purchased Heating" energy usage in stand-alone mode. If blank in stand-alone mode, the hot water supply temperature defaults to the cold water supply temperature. This field is ignored if the object is used with the [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object.

#### Field: Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name

Reference to the Schedule object specifying the cold water temperature [C] from the supply mains that provides the cold water to the tap and makes up for all water lost down the drain. If blank, water temperatures are calculated by the [Site:WaterMainsTemperature](#sitewatermainstemperature) object. This field is ignored if the object is used with the [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object.

#### Field: Zone Name

Reference to the zone name where the water equipment will be considered as latent load to the zone.

#### Field: Sensible Fraction Schedule Name

Reference to the schedule object specifying the fraction of the maximum possible sensible heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that is added to the zone. If blank, the schedule defaults to 0 at all times.

#### Field: Latent Fraction Schedule Name

Reference to the schedule object specifying the fraction of the maximum possible latent heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that is added to the zone. If blank, the schedule defaults to 0 at all times.

- Connections to [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) objects to store and draw reclaimed water
- Internal connections to simulate drainwater heat recovery.

![Diagram of internal connections for WaterUse:Connections](media/diagram-of-internal-connections-for-wateruse.png)


The [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object can be used stand-alone or coupled into a plant loop. In stand-alone mode, the Hot and Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedules override the values for the listed [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) objects. When coupled to the plant, the Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule is overridden by the actual plant loop inlet water temperature. When coupled to the plant, the [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object should be on a [Branch](#branch) object whose control type is set to "Active."

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

The unique object name for reference by other objects.

#### Field: Inlet Node Name

The hot water inlet node when connected to a plant loop. The hot water supplies all of the [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) objects that demand hot water. Insufficient supply temperature or flow results in cooler water at the tap.

#### Field: Outlet Node Name

The cold water outlet node, i.e. the cold water supply mains, when connected to a plant loop. The return node provides make-up water for the hot water lost down the drain.

#### Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name

Reference to the [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) object that supplies cold water to the listed [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) objects. If the field is blank, or the tank is empty, fresh water is supplied from the water mains.

#### Field: Reclamation Water Storage Tank Name

#### Field: Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name

Reference to the schedule object specifying the hot water temperature [C]. If blank in stand-alone mode, the hot water supply temperature defaults to the cold water supply temperature. This field (even if blank) overrides the Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule in all of the listed [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) objects.

#### Field: Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name

Reference to the schedule object specifying the cold water temperature [C] from the supply mains that provides the cold water to the tap and makes up for all water lost down the drain. If blank, water temperatures are calculated by the [Site:WaterMainsTemperature](#sitewatermainstemperature) object.

This field (even if blank) overrides the Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule in all of the listed [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) objects.

#### Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger Type

The heat exchanger type to be used for drainwater heat recovery. None indicates no heat recovery is to be simulated. Ideal sets a heat exchanger effectiveness of 1.0. Effectiveness is calculated dynamically for CounterFlow and CrossFlow options.

One popular type of drainwater heat exchanger is the Gravity-Film Heat Exchanger (GFX). The GFX is most closely approximated with the CounterFlow option, but keep in mind that the UA varies more with flow rate for the GFX than for most traditional heat exchangers.

#### Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger Destination

The heat exchanger configuration to be used for drainwater heat recovery. The configuration determines where the heat will be used after it is recovered.

Plant indicates that the all of the recovered heat will be sent to the return flow at the outlet node of the [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object to preheat the make-up cold water from the water mains.

Equipment indicates that the all of the recovered heat will be used to preheat the cold water flow side of the [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) objects listed *in this* [WaterUse:Connections](#wateruseconnections) object

PlantAndEquipment indicates the recovered heat will be divided between the plant and the [WaterUse:Equipment](#wateruseequipment) objects, as described above. This is the only option where the flow rates are equal in the drain and the heat exchanger.

#### Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger U-Factor Times Area

The UA is the heat transfer coefficient [W/K] for the heat exchanger and is the product of U, the overall heat transfer coefficient, and A, the heat exchanger surface area.

## WaterUse:Storage

The [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) object is a central component for complex water systems. This object is not needed if the only use of water is directly from the mains, or utility service water. If the building model is to include any on-site collection or wells or storing and reuse of graywater, then a [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) is needed. Each [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) can serve as a central node and make connections to numerous sources of supply or numerous components with demand. If a maximum capacity is not specified, the tank is assumed to have unlimited capacity. This is useful for sizing.

Storage tanks may handle a lot of water but show no use. This is because water usage is metered at the component level were water is "used up."  The only water a storage tank might use up is overflow water if it is discarded.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

The unique object name for reference by other objects.

#### Field: Water Quality Subcategory

Describes the quality of the water contained in the tank. Used for reporting and to check that the uses and supply match the category of water quality.

#### Field: Maximum Capacity

The maximum volumetric capacity [m3] of the water tank. If blank, this field defaults to unlimited capacity.

The volume of water in the storage tank at the beginning of each simulation environmental period [m3]. This provides a starting point for the amount of water in storage.

#### Field: Design In Flow Rate

The design flow rate [m3/s] of fittings that provide water into the tank from external sources. In a scenario where a heavy rain fall is being harvested, the actual reclamation rate might be limited by pipe size or filtration. If blank, this field defaults to unlimited rate.

#### Field: Design Out Flow Rate

The design flow rate [m3/s] of fitting that withdraw water from the tank to end uses. Heavy demand (landscaping?) might be limited by pipe size or filtration. If Blank, this field defaults to unlimited rate.

#### Field: Overflow Destination

Name of a second [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) that would receive overflow. Overflow could occur if the maximum capacity is reached or if the design in flow rate is exceeded. If left blank, then the overflow is discarded and lost from the water system.

#### Field: Type of Supply Controlled by Float Valve

The storage tank can include the capability of modeling a float valve that will call for water to be added to the tank. This field is used to select the type of system used to respondto fill requests made by a float valve. The available options are â€˜None', â€˜Mains', â€˜GroundwaterWell', or â€˜OtherTank.'  The float valve settings are described in the next two fields.

#### Field: Float Valve On Capacity

The volumetric capacity [m3] of the water tank when a floating valve would turn on to allow filling the tank.

#### Field: Float Valve Off Capacity

The volumetric capacity [m3] of the water tank when a floating valve would turn off after having been filling the tank.

#### Field: Backup Mains Capacity

The volumetric capacity of the tank that indicates where a secondary float valve will maintain the volume by calling for mains water. Used if the well or other tank cannot keep up with the needs of the main float valve. If left blank or equal 0.0, then there is no mains water backup. If specified, then mains water will be drawn once the storage tank reaches this level and then the mains water will fill all the way to capacity specified in the previous field.

#### Field: Other Tank Name

This field contains the name of another [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) defined elsewhere in the input file. This field is only used if the Type of Controlled Supply field is set to â€˜OtherTank' and the current tank is to be configured to be supplied by a second tank in response to a float valve.

#### Field: Water Thermal Mode

Controls the method of determining the temperature of the water in the storage tank. The only available option at the current time is ScheduledTemperature.

#### Field: Water Temperature Schedule Name

Reference to the schedule object specifying the temperature [C] of the water in the tank. This takes the place of a full thermal model of the tank.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Indicator

Reserved for future use. The field can be Schedule, [Zone](#zone), or Outdoors.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Schedule Name

## WaterUse:RainCollector

The [WaterUse:RainCollector](#wateruseraincollector) object is used for harvesting rainwater falling on building surfaces. The rainwater is sent to a [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) object. In order to use this object it is necessary to also include a [Site:Precipitation](#siteprecipitation) object to describe the rates of rainfall.

### Inputs

#### Field: Name

The unique object name for reference by other objects.

#### Field: Storage Tank Name

A reference to a [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) object where the rainwater will be collected and stored for later use.

#### Field: Loss Factor Mode

The [WaterUse:RainCollector](#wateruseraincollector) model includes a loss factor that indicates the portion of incident rain that is not successfully collected. Two modes are available: Constant and Scheduled. Enter Constant in this field for the model to use a simple fixed loss factor defined in the next field. For versatility, the loss factor can follow a schedule by entering Scheduled in this field and then the name of a schedule in the second field below.

#### Field: Collection Loss Factor

Constant loss factor for how much of the incident rainwater is lost and not collected. The factor should be between 0 and 1.

#### Field: Collection Loss Factor Schedule Name

Name of a schedule that defines a variable collection loss factor if the mode is selected as Scheduled.

#### Field: Maximum Collection Rate

The maximum flow rate [m3/s] for rainwater collection. In a scenario where a heavy rain fall is being harvested, the actual reclamation rate might be limited by pipe size or the filtration system.

#### Field: Collection Surface 1-10 Name

A reference to the name of a surface object which will collect the rain. Typically the collection surfaces would correspond to roof surfaces on the building. The effective area for rainwater collection is the horizontal component (area \* cosine of the slope, etc.).  More detailed modeling of rainwater collection can be added later to account for factors such as wind speed and direction, etc.

#### Water System Rainwater Collector Volume Flow Rate [m3/s]

This output variable provides the rate of water collected by the [WaterUse:RainCollector](#wateruseraincollector), in units of cubic meters per second (m^3^/s).

#### Water System Rainwater Collector Volume [m3]

This output variable provides the volume of water collected by the [WaterUse:RainCollector](#wateruseraincollector), in units of cubic meters per second (m^3^/s). This output is also added to a meter with Resource Type = OnSiteWater, End Use Key = RainWater, and Group Key = System (ref. Output Meter).

## WaterUse:Well 

The [WaterUse:Well](#waterusewell) object is for simulating on-site water supply from a well. Well water is pumped out of the ground and into a [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage). The operation of the ground water well is controlled by the associated [WaterUse:Storage](#waterusestorage) which is assumed to be operated as a vented cistern with no pressure tank. The current implementation is very simple and only requires two numeric inputs: the rated pump flow and power. A more elaborate well model may be added and many input fields are reserved for this future expansion.

### Inputs
