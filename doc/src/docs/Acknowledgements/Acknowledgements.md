Refrigeration compressor performance data and refrigeration practices were provided by CDH Energy, Cazenovia, NY 12035.

The external interface was developed by Michael Wetter and Philip Haves (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and by Rui Zhang (Carnegie Mellon University). An earlier upgrade to a development version of EnergyPlus 3.0 was implemented by Charles Corbin, Anthony Florita, Gregor Henze and Peter May-Ostendorp (University of Colorado at Boulder).

Various suggestions for time reduction, improved documentation and other items have been incorporated from Autodesk, Inc., Bentley Systems, and others.

Particular recognition goes to Noel Keen (LBNL Computational Research Division) and Geof Sawaya (Oak Ridge National Laboratory fellow) who have done extensive profiling and creation of time reduction features that have gone into the code.

Second Law modified the WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit module to include the variable “WaterCyclingMode”. This variable determines whether the heat pump water flow is constant, whether it cycles with the compressor, or whether it is constant when the heat pump is active. WaterFlowMode is set by the HVAC wrapper object; either ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump or AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir. Second Law, Burlington, VT, Karen Walkerman.

### ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY

zlib 1.2.5 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h (volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@gzip.org).  A usage example of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests that the library is working correctly.  Another example is given in the file minigzip.c.  The compression library itself is composed of all source files except example.c and minigzip.c.

To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at the top of Makefile.in.  In short "./configure; make test", and if that goes well, "make install" should work for most flavors of Unix.  For Windows, use one of the special makefiles in win32/ or contrib/vstudio/ .  For VMS, use make\_vms.com.  Questions about zlib should be sent to &lt;zlib@gzip.org&gt;, or to Gilles Vollant &lt;info@winimage.com&gt; for the Windows DLL version.  The zlib home page is http://zlib.net/ .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site to verify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest version and check whether the problem still exists or not.

PLEASE read the zlib FAQ &gt;http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html&lt; before asking for help.

Mark Nelson &lt;markn@ieee.org&gt; wrote an article about zlib for the Jan.  1997 issue of Dr.  Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available at &lt;http://marknelson.us/1997/01/01/zlib-engine/&gt; .

The changes made in version 1.2.5 are documented in the file ChangeLog.

Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory contrib/ .

zlib is available in Java using the java.util.zip package, documented at &lt;http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/&gt; .

A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess &lt;pmqs@cpan.org&gt; is available at CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, including &lt;http://search.cpan.org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/&gt; .

A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling &lt;amk@amk.ca&gt; is available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see &lt;http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-zlib.html&gt;.

zlib is built into tcl: &lt;http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610&gt; .

An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top of zlib by Gilles Vollant &lt;info@winimage.com&gt;, is available in the contrib/minizip directory of zlib.

Notes for some targets:

- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL\_FAQ.txt

- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32   compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.

- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works when compiled with cc.

- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.

- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.

- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or BEOS.

- For PalmOs, see &lt;http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/&gt;

Acknowledgments:

  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz.  The deflate and zlib specifications were written by L.  Peter Deutsch.  Thanks to all the people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib; they are too numerous to cite here.
