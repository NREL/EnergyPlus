Introduction
============

This document is intended to give an in-depth look at the various output files produced by EnergyPlus. Some of these may be referenced in various other parts of the documentation but are presented here with more details.

The scripts that assist in running EnergyPlus will usually rename the standard names used in the program. The two scripts that are distributed with EnergyPlus are: **EPL-Run.bat** (which is used by the EP-Launch program) and **RunEPlus.bat**  (which can be used from the command line). The RunEPlus batch file can also be used to string together several runs such as usually termed “batch processing”. In renaming the files created by the program or its post-processing program(s), usually the file extension will be retained. The following table will illustrate the native EnergyPlus file name, a description of its contents and the EP-Launch “version” of the file. In this table, &lt;filename&gt; refers to the source/original file name (without extension) selected. Files are presented in alphabetic order. For output purposes, the most important files to understand are the eplusout.eso, eplusout.mtr and eplusout.err files. The first two are manipulated with the ReadVarsESO post processing program. The latter will contain any critical errors that were encountered during the run.

Output Files
============

Output File List
----------------

Following are the native file names that are output from EnergyPlus; native – directly out of EnergyPlus. Usually you will not see these file names as batch files and interfaces will change them to be &lt;file name&gt;.&lt;ext&gt; or in some instances &lt;file name&gt;&lt;qualifier&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;. Usually the extension is the important piece and is described in the following table.

In addition to the basic output files from EnergyPlus there are three standard “hybrid” output files. These are called “hybrid” because they are a result of post-processing after EnergyPlus has completed. Note that if there is an error during processing, these will not normally be “complete”.

Now, each file will be described in more detail with some examples of use.

eplusout.audit
--------------

This file is simply the echo of the inputs to the EnergyPlus program – the Energy+.idd (data dictionary) and in.idf (&lt;filename&gt;.idf – the input data file). Every attempt has been made to not require this file to be saved – errors are interpreted as much as possible and encapsulated onto the eplusout.err file. Any errors in the data dictionary processing should be accomplished during development – users should never see errors there. Thus, this file is not “saved” after processing by the standard script file. Occasionally, you may wish to view this file because of something obscure.

An excerpt of the file follows. Lines in green are notes produced from EnergyPlus (some of these are more useful to developers than users). Lines in red are lines with error messages shown to illustrate context. The other lines are echoes from inputs (with line numbers).

In all the examples, the actual version of the EnergyPlus exe would appear. In the examples these will be shown as: &lt;version&gt;.

eplusout.bnd
------------

The “branch node details” (bnd) file is intended to give enough information that one could (with a chosen software) diagram the nodes and components of the HVAC system. It may or may not achieve that objective. Of more use may be its illustration of node connection/branch errors that aren’t detected by the software. This file has the details to support any “node connection” errors that will be noted in the eplusout.err file. Branch validation is shown in this file. Branches are checked to assure that each output node of the branch element is an input node to the next branch element. Cross-branch checking is not done directly within the program though the details will illustrate some problems of that nature.

Supply and Return Air Paths are also checked and feedback about each item are shown.

As is standard with many EnergyPlus output files, this file is CSV (comma-delimited) such that it can be read by spreadsheet programs for further manipulation by the user.

An example will illustrate. Notes about the reporting are highlighted in green.

eplusout.dbg

Developers use this file during debugging and can be “turned on” by the DEBUG OUTPUT object in the input file. The only reason a user might specify this flag would be to send a file to the support group.

eplusout.dxf
------------

The DXF output report file is formatted according to the “Data Exchange Format” standard rules for representing CADD type coordinates. The file can be used in several inexpensive, shareware or freeware viewers. Quickview Plus ™ can display DXF files as shown in Figure 1 below. A free program originally from Autocad™, Voloview Express™, can display solid model rendering as shown in Figure 2. Other viewers are available from Microstation™, Visio™ and other shareware or freeware vendors.

This file is generated when the following line is included in the IDF.

**Output:Surfaces:Drawing, DXF;**

You can ask it to triangulate surfaces with &gt;4 sides:

**Output:Surfaces:Drawing, DXF, Triangulate3dface;**

In addition to the building shape (including detached shading elements), the DXF view includes a “true north” arrow (at ground level) and the name from the BUILDING object.

![SCCPAPER](media/image001.jpg)

Figure 1. Quick View Plus version of DXF file

Even in the Quick View version, you can see that the different building elements have different colors. These are the “original” colors used in EnergyPlus. The current default color scheme is shown in the following figure of the solid model.

eplusout.edd
-----------

This file is invoked by including an Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object. The EDD file contains three different types of information related to the Energy Management System (EMS) including: (1) listing of available actuators, (2) listing of available internal variables, and (3) a record of the execution of user’s programs for the EnergyPlus Runtime Language (Erl).

The EMS feature in EnergyPlus uses “Actuators” to do control operations. The actuators available in a given model depend on the non-EMS-related content of the input file. Similar to how EnergyPlus reports the available output variables to the RDD file, a list of available actuators can be written to the EDD file. There are three settings in the Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object that control how actuators are listed. Selecting “None” directs the program to not list the available actuators. Selecting “NotByUniqueKeyNames” directs the program to provide a concise listing of the available actuators that does not include their enumeration by unique name. Selecting “Verbose” directs the program to provide a complete listing of the available actuators including the unique identifying names. An example listing of actuators using the  “NotByUniqueKeyNames”  option follows.

EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator Available, \*,Surface,Exterior Surface Convection Heat Transfer Coefficient,[W/m2-K]

EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator Available, \*,Ideal Loads Air System,Air Mass Flow Rate,[kg/s]



The EMS feature in EnergyPlus uses “Internal Variables” to obtain input data for use in scaling the results of control calculations. The internal variables available in a give model depend on the non-EMS-related content of the input file. Similar to how EnergyPlus reports the available output variables to the RDD file, a list of available internal variables can be written to the EDD file. There are three settings in the Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object that control how internal variables are listed. Selecting “None” directs the program to not list the available internal variables. Selecting “NotByUniqueKeyNames” directs the program to provide a concise listing of the available internal variables that does not include their enumeration by unique name. Selecting “Verbose” directs the program to provide a complete listing of the available internal variables including the unique identifying names. An example listing of actuators using the  “NotByUniqueKeyNames”  option follows.

! &lt;EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable Available&gt;, \*, Internal Data Type

EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable Available, \*,People Count Design Level,[each]

EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable Available, \*,Lighting Power Design Level,[W]

EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable Available, \*,Plug and Process Power Design Level,[W]

EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable Available, \*,Zone List Multiplier,[ ]

EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable Available, \*,Zone Air Volume,[m3]

EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable Available, \*,Zone Multiplier,[ ]

EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable Available, \*,Zone List Multiplier,[ ]



The EMS uses the EnergyPlus Runtime Language, or Erl, to do custom controlling. When Erl programs are being developed, the EDD becomes a primary source of information for debugging. When a line of Erl code is executed, the program can output records called “line traces” that are useful for debugging because they show the outcome of each line of code. There are three settings in the Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object that control how line traces are reported. Selecting “None” directs the program to not write out any line traces. Selecting “ErrorsOnly” directs the program to only write line traces when computation errors are encountered (such as divide by zero). Selecting “Verbose” directs the program to write out line traces for each and every line of Erl program code that is executed.

It is very important to be careful with the EDD file. The Verbose option should be used with care because a full line-by-line trace of Erl program execution for an annual run can easily create an enormous computer file that is too large for most computer systems.  It is possible for EnergyPlus to generate an EDD file that cannot be opened in traditional text editors.

eplusout.eio
------------

This file contains some standard and some optional “reports”. It is intended to be a somewhat intelligent report of input conditions when they don’t fit well in other places or when they aren’t substantial enough for their own “file”. (e.g. **eplusout.bnd**)  Contents of the file are somewhat documented in various places in the [Input Output Reference document](file:///E:\Docs4PDFs\InputOutputReference.pdf) – as results of objects. This file or portions of it can be easily imported into spreadsheet programs and more analysis done there. Contents of this file include construction details, location information, “environment” information, number of “warmup” days required in each environment.

The form of the file is a data dictionary line followed by the data. In this case, the data dictionary line precedes the first “data” line though there may be several defining “dictionary lines”. Each dictionary line will show the field as &lt;field name&gt; followed by other fields that will be in the data lines. Data will be displayed similarly. Each field of dictionary or data will be separated from the next by a comma “,” – and produce a comma delimited file. However, the lines for data will not be contiguous – some follow a stream of consciousness of the EnergyPlus execution.

This section is subdivided into grouped sections by type.

Note that the lines in the eplusout.eio file can be extremely long (current limit is 500 characters).

The simulation parameters output is the simplest form of reporting in the **eplusout.eio** file. Each of the “header” records (lines starting with an “!”) are followed immediately by the one and only data line. By and large, these data lines are all merely echoes of the entries in the IDF (or defaulted for blank fields). For most of these descriptions, you can look at the object fields (of same name) in the [Input Output Reference](file:///E:\Docs4PDFs\InputOutputReference.pdf) document.

### Version

! &lt;Version&gt;, Version ID

 Version, &lt;version&gt;

This is the version of the IDF as entered in the IDF file. If it does not match the current EnergyPlus Version, a warning will be issued and show in the **eplusout.err** file.

### Timestep

! &lt;Timesteps per Hour&gt;, \#TimeSteps, Minutes per TimeStep

 Timesteps Per Hour,  4, 15

This is the number of timesteps in hour as entered in the IDF file as well as showing how many minutes will encompass each timestep (i.e. 4 timesteps in hour = 15 minutes per timestep).

### SimulationControl

! &lt;Run Control&gt;, Do Zone Sizing, Do System Sizing, Do Plant Sizing, Do Design Days, Do Weather Simulation, Do HVAC Sizing Simulation

 Run Control, Yes, Yes, Yes, No, Yes, No

This shows how the sizing and running (design days vs. weather file) will be accomplished. Design days are required for sizing but do not necessarily need to be “run” after sizing has completed. Thus, the user can choose to do sizing, not do a “normal” calculation with the design day definitions but then go ahead and run the full simulation year.  Some advanced sizing methods require also running HVAC Sizing Simulations.

### Building

! &lt;Building Information&gt;, Building Name,North Axis {deg},Terrain,  Loads Convergence Tolerance Value,Temperature Convergence Tolerance Value,  Solar Distribution,Maximum Number of Warmup Days

 Building Information, BUILDING,  30.000,City,   0.04000,   0.40000,FullExterior,25

This shows the values put in for the Building Object in the IDF.

### Inside Convection Algorithm

! &lt;Inside Convection Algorithm&gt;, Value {Simple | Detailed | CeilingDiffuser}

Inside Convection Algorithm,Simple

This shows the global inside (interior) convection algorithm selected by the IDF value. This may be overridden by zone entries or even surface entries.

### Outside Convection Algorithm

! &lt;Outside Convection Algorithm&gt;, Value {Simple | Detailed ! TARP ! MoWitt ! DOE-2 ! BLAST}

Outside Convection Algorithm,Simple

This shows the global outside (exterior) convection algorithm selected by the IDF value. This may be overridden by zone entries or even surface entries.

### Solution Algorithm

! &lt;Solution Algorithm&gt;, Value {CTF | EMPD | CONDFD | HAMT},Inside Surface Max Temperature Limit{C}

Solution Algorithm, CTF,200

This shows the solution algorithm approach selected by the IDF value and Inside Surface Max Temperature override or default value.

### Sky Radiance Distribution

! &lt;Sky Radiance Distribution&gt;, Value {Anisotropic}

Sky Radiance Distribution,Anisotropic

This shows the solution algorithm approach used in the simulation. As this value cannot be changed by the user, it is shown for information only.

### Site Atmospheric Variation

! &lt;Environment:Site Atmospheric Variation&gt;,Wind Speed Profile Exponent {},Wind Speed Profile Boundary Layer Thickness {m},Air Temperature Gradient Coefficient {K/m}

Environment:Site Atmospheric Variation,0.330,460.000,6.500000E-003

This shows actual values used for Site Atmospheric Variations.

### Shadowing/Sun Position Calculations

! &lt;Shadowing/Sun Position Calculations&gt; [Annual Simulations], Calculation Method, Value {days}, Allowable Number Figures in Shadow Overlap {}, Polygon Clipping Algorithm, Sky Diffuse Modeling Algorithm

Shadowing/Sun Position Calculations, AverageOverDaysInFrequency, 20, 15000, SutherlandHodgman, SimpleSkyDiffuseModeling

This shows how many days between the re-calculation of solar position during a weather file simulation. While a smaller number of days will lead to a more accurate solar position estimation (solar position is important in shadowing as well as determining how much solar enters the space), it also increases the calculation time necessarily to complete the simulation. The default, re-calculating every 20 days, gives a good compromise. The allowable number of figures in a shadow overlap can be increased if necessary for the model. There are two calculation methods available: AverageOverDaysInFrequency (default) and DetailedTimestepIntegration.

### AirflowNetwork Model:Control

! &lt;AirflowNetwork Model:Control&gt;, No Multizone or Distribution/Multizone with Distribution/Multizone without Distribution/Multizone with Distribution only during Fan Operation

AirflowNetwork Model:Control,MultizoneWithoutDistribution

This shows the AirflowNetwork Model:Control selected by the IDF value in the object AirflowNetwork:SimulationControl.

### AirflowNetwork Model:Wind Direction

! &lt;AirflowNetwork Model:Wind Direction&gt;, Wind Direction \#1 to n (degree)

AirflowNetwork Model:Wind Direction, 0.0,30.0,60.0,90.0,120.0,150.0,180.0,210.0,240.0,270.0,300.0,330.0

#### Field: &lt;AirflowNetwork Model:Wind Direction&gt;

This field contains the field name “AirflowNetwork Model:Wind Direction”.

#### Field: Wind Direction \#1 to n

These values are the wind directions corresponding to the first through the Nth wind pressure coefficient value. If Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = Input in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControl object, the wind directions described here are the inputs specified in the AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientArray object,. If Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControl object, the wind directions are also described here and are fixed at 30 degree increments.

### AirflowNetwork Model:Wind Pressure Coefficients

#### Field:  &lt; AirflowNetwork Model: Wind Pressure Coefficients&gt;

This field contains the constant “AirflowNetwork Model: Wind Pressure Coefficients” for each line.

#### Field: Name

This is the WindPressureCoefficientValues object name entered from the IDF.

#### Field: Wind Pressure Coefficients \#1 to n

These values are the wind pressure coefficient for the building façade. These wind pressure coefficient values correspond to the first through Nth wind directions reported above for &lt;AirflowNetwork Model:Wind Direction&gt;. If Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = INPUT in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControl object, the wind pressure coefficients described here are the inputs specified in the AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Wind Pressure Coefficient Values object,. If Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControl object, the wind pressure coefficients are calculated internally and also described here.

### Zone Volume Capacitance Multiplier

! &lt;Zone Volume Capacitance Multiplier&gt;, Sensible Heat Capacity Multiplier, Moisture Capacity Multiplier, Carbon Dioxide Capacity Multiplier, Generic Contaminant Capacity Multiplier

Zone Volume Capacitance Multiplier,   1.000, 1.000, 1.000, 1.000

This shows the zone volume capacitance multipliers selected by the IDF value or defaulted. The object for this item is ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier:ResearchSpecial.

#### Field: Sensible Heat Capacity Multiplier

Value used to alter the effective heat capacitance of the zone air volume.

#### Field: Moisture Capacity Multiplier

Value used to alter the effective moisture capacitance of the zone air volume.

#### Field: Carbon Dioxide Capacity Multiplier

Value used to alter the effective carbon dioxide capacitance of the zone air volume.

#### Field: Generic Contaminant Capacity Multiplier

Value used to alter the effective generic contaminant capacitance of the zone air volume.

#### Surface Geometry

! &lt;SurfaceGeometry&gt;,Starting Corner,Vertex Input Direction,Coordinate System,Daylight Reference Point Coordinate System,Rectangular (Simple) Surface Coordinate System

Surface Geometry, UpperLeftCorner, Counterclockwise, RelativeCoordinateSystem, RelativeCoordinateSystem, RelativeToZoneOrigin

This shows the expected order of the vertices for each surface. The object for this item is GlobalGeometryRules.

#### Field: Starting Corner

Value used to designate which corner the surface(s) start with.

#### Field: Vertex Input Direction

Value whether the coordinates for the surface are entered clockwise or counter-clockwise.

#### Field: Coordinate System

Value whether the coordinate system is World/Absolute or Relative.

#### Field: Daylight Reference Point Coordinate System

If daylighting is used, this describes the coordinate system for entering daylight reference points.

#### Field: Rectangular (Simple) Surface Coordinate System

For simple surfaces (Wall, Window, Door, and so forth) the coordinate system that is used to describe their starting point.

### Program Control

! &lt;Program Control Information:Threads/Parallel Sims&gt;, Threading Supported,Maximum Number of Threads, Env Set Threads (OMP\_NUM\_THREADS), EP Env Set Threads (EP\_OMP\_NUM\_THREADS). IDF Set Threads, Number of Threads Used (Interior Radiant Exchange), Number Nominal Surfaces, Number Parallel Sims

Program Control:Threads/Parallel Sims, Yes,2, Not Set, Not Set, Not Set, 2, 60, N/A



More examples:

Program Control:Threads/Parallel Sims, Yes,2, Not Set, Not Set, Not Set, 1, 6, N/A

Program Control:Threads/Parallel Sims, Yes,2, Not Set, Not Set, 1, 1, 46, N/A

This describes the threading that may be active for the simulation. The ProgramControl object is used for this output. As described in that object, only the Interior Radiant Exchange calculation has been exposed to use threading, goal being to speed up calculations but may not always be the most beneficial.

#### Field: Threading Supported

The compile of the program has to support threading (OpenMP for now). If it is compiled thus, this field will be **Yes**.  Otherwise it will be **No**.

#### Field: Maximum Number of Threads

Regardless of whether the compile has supported threading, the system is queried for the number of threads possible – that number is entered in this field.

#### Field: Env Set Threads (OMP\_NUM\_THREADS)

The Environment Variable OMP\_NUM\_THREADS can be manually inserted to set the number of system threads to be used. This would be reported here if set.  If not set, **Not Set** will be shown. This is a system variable, but suggest that you use the following environment variable if you want to manually control the number of threads.

#### Field: EP Env Set Threads (EP\_OMP\_NUM\_THREADS)

The Environment Variable EP\_OMP\_NUM\_THREADS can be manually inserted to set the number of system threads to be used. This would be reported here if set.  If not set, **Not Set** will be shown.

#### Field: IDF Set Threads

If you use the ProgramControl object in your IDF, you can again manually control the number of threads to be used. This would be reported here if set.  If not set, **Not Set** will be shown.

#### Field: Number of Threads Used (Interior Radiant Exchange)

This is the number of threads that was actually used in the Interior Radiant Exchange routines (which calculates the interior surface temperatures).

#### Field: Number Nominal Surfaces

This is the number of “nominal” surfaces (based on surface objects) that a quick calculation from the program has found. If the number of surfaces is not greater than 30, then the number of threads to be used will be set by the program to 1.

#### Field: Number Parallel Sims

This is the number of windowed/parallel simulations being run simultaneously as set by EP-Launch or other scripts distributed with the EnergyPlus program. Third party distributions may also set this item.



### Climate Group Outputs

Climate related variables appear in two places for EnergyPlus outputs. Certain objects that are invariant throughout a simulation period have lines appear in the eplusout.eio file:

! &lt;Environment:Weather Station&gt;,Wind Sensor Height Above Ground {m},Wind Speed Profile Exponent {},Wind Speed Profile Boundary Layer Thickness {m},Air Temperature Sensor Height Above Ground {m},Wind Speed Modifier Coefficient [Internal],Temperature Modifier Coefficient [Internal]

Environment:Weather Station,10.000,0.140,270.000,1.500,1.586,9.750E-003

! &lt;Location&gt;, Location Name, Latitude, Longitude, Time Zone Number, Elevation {m}

 Location, DENVER COLORADO,   39.75, -104.87,   -7.00,      1610.26



In addition for each “environment” simulated, information about the environment is shown:

! &lt;Environment&gt;,Environment Name,Environment Type, Start Date, End Date, Start DayOfWeek, Duration {\#days}, Source:Start DayOfWeek,  Use Daylight Savings, Use Holidays, Apply Weekend Holiday Rule

! &lt;Environment:Special Days&gt;, Special Day Name, Special Day Type, Source, Start Date, Duration {\#days}

! &lt;Environment:Design\_Day\_Misc&gt;,DayOfYear,ASHRAE A Coeff,ASHRAE B Coeff,ASHRAE C Coeff,Solar Constant-Annual Variation,Eq of Time {minutes}, Solar Declination Angle {deg}, Solar Model

! &lt;Environment:WarmupDays&gt;, NumberofWarmupDays

For example, a DesignDay:

Environment,PHOENIX ARIZONA WINTER,DesignDay, 1/21, 1/21,MONDAY,  1,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Environment:Daylight Saving,No,DesignDay

Environment:Design\_Day\_Misc, 21,1228.9,0.1414,5.7310E-002,1.0,-11.14,-20.0

A Design RunPeriod:

Environment,EXTREME SUMMER WEATHER PERIOD FOR DESIGN,User Selected WeatherFile Typical/Extreme Period (Design)=Summer Extreme,07/13,07/19,SummerDesignDay,  7,Use RunPeriod Specified Day,No ,No ,No ,No ,No

Environment:Daylight Saving,No,RunPeriod Object

Environment:WarmupDays,  3

Or a RunPeriod (Name listed in the RunPeriod output is dependent on user input for the RunPeriod object – when a blank is input, the name of the weather file location is used):

Environment,CHICAGO IL TMY2-94846 WMO\#=725300,WeatherRunPeriod, 1/ 1,12/31,SUNDAY,365,UseWeatherFile,Yes,Yes,No

Environment:Daylight Saving,No,

Environment:Special Days,NEW YEARS DAY,Holiday,WeatherFile, 1/ 1,  1

Environment:Special Days,MEMORIAL DAY,Holiday,WeatherFile, 5/31,  1

Environment:Special Days,INDEPENDENCE DAY,Holiday,WeatherFile, 7/ 5,  1

Environment:Special Days,LABOR DAY,Holiday,WeatherFile, 9/ 6,  1

Environment:Special Days,THANKSGIVING,Holiday,WeatherFile,11/25,  1

Environment:Special Days,CHRISTMAS,Holiday,WeatherFile,12/25,  1

Environment:WarmupDays,  4

Note that in this display, using “weekend rule” and specific date holidays, the actual observed dates are shown in the output display – in the example above, Independence Day (July 4) is actually observed on July 5.

### Climate Group – Simple Outputs

Some of the climate outputs are a “simple” group. The “header” line is followed immediately by the data line.

### Location

This output represents the location data used for the simulation. Note that if a runperiod is used, the IDF “Location” is ignored and the location from the weather file is used instead.

#### Field: &lt;Location&gt;

This data field will contain the constant “Location”.

#### Field: Location Name

This is the name given to the location whether from the IDF or the weather file.

#### Field: Latitude

This is the latitude of the site, expressed decimally. Convention uses positive (+) values for North of the Equator and negative (-) values for South of the Equator. For example, S 30° 15’ is expressed as –30.25.

#### Field: Longitude

This is the longitude of the site, expressed decimally. Convention uses positive (+) values for East of the Greenwich meridian and negative (-) values for West of the Greenwich meridian. For example, E 130° 45’ is expressed as +130.75.

#### Field: Time Zone Number

This is the time zone of the site, expressed decimally. Convention uses positive (+) values for GMT+ (Longitude East of the Greenwich meridian) and negative (-) values for GMT- (Longitude West of the Greenwich meridian). For example, the time zone for Central US time is –6. The time zone for parts of Newfoundland is –3.5 (-3 hours, 30 minutes from GMT).

#### Field: Elevation {m}

This is the elevation of the site. Units are m.

### Weather Station

#### Field: Wind Sensor Height Above Ground {m}

This is the wind sensor height above ground for weather data measurements.

#### Field: Wind Speed Profile Exponent {}

The wind speed profile exponent for the terrain surrounding the weather station.

#### Field: Wind Speed Profile Boundary Layer Thickness {m}

The wind speed profile boundary layer thickness [m] for the terrain surrounding the weather station.

#### Field: Air Temperature Sensor Height Above Ground {m}

The height [m] above ground for the air temperature sensor.

#### Field: Wind Speed Modifier Coefficient [Internal]

This field is intended to provide a slight help for the user to determine the calculations that will be used to calculate the Wind Speed at a specific height at the site.

The full calculation for Local Wind Speed is:

<div>\[ \text{LocalWindSpeed} = \text{WindSpeed}_{met} \left( \frac{\text{WindBoundaryLayerThickness}_{met}}{\text{AirSensorHeight}_{met}} \right)^{\text{WindExponent}_{met}} \left(\frac{\text{HeightAboveGround}_{site/component}}{\text{WindBoundaryLayerThickness}_{site}}\right)^{\text{SiteWindExponent}}  \]</div>

The Wind Speed Modifier Coefficient [Internal] simplifies the equation to:

<div>\[ \text{LocalWindSpeed} = \text{WindSpeed}_{met} \left( \text{WindSpeedModifier} \right) \left(\frac{\text{HeightAboveGround}_{site/component}}{\text{WindBoundaryLayerThickness}_{site}}\right)^{\text{SiteWindExponent}}  \]</div>

Where the Wind Speed Modifier encapsulates:

<div>\[ \text{WindSpeedModifier} = \left( \frac{\text{WindBoundaryLayerThickness}_{met}}{\text{AirSensorHeight}_{met}} \right)^{\text{WindExponent}_{met}} \]</div>

Where

* met = meteorological station
* site = location of the building

#### Field:Temperature Modifier Coefficient [Internal]

This field is intended to provide a slight help for the user to determine the calculations that will be used to calculate the air (dry-bulb) or wet-bulb temperature at a specific height at the site.

The site temperature modifier coefficient (TMC) is defined as:

<div>\[ TMC = frac{ \text{AtmosphericTemperatureGradient} \cdot \text{EarthRadius} \cdot \text{TemperatureSensorHeight}_{met} }
                  { \text{EarthRadius} + \text{TemperatureSensorHeight}_{met} } \]</div>

Then, the temperature at a height above ground is calculated as:

<div>\[ \text{ActualTemperature} = \text{Temperature}_{met} + TMC - 
    frac{ \text{TemperatureGradient}_{site} * \text{EarthRadius} * \text{Height}_{site/component} }
        { \text{EarthRadius} + \text{Height}_{site/component} } \]</div>

Where

* met = meteorological station
* site = location of the building

This field contains the constant “Zone Information” for each line.

#### Field: Zone Name

This is the Zone Name entered from the IDF.

#### Field: North Axis {deg}

This is the North Axis entered from the IDF. Note that this is used primarily in the positioning of the building when “relative” coordinates are used – however, the Daylighting:Detailed object also uses this. Units are degrees, clockwise from North.

#### Fields: X Origin {m}, Y Origin {m}, Z Origin {m}

This is the origin vertex {X,Y,Z} entered from the IDF. Note that this is used primarily in the positioning of the building when “relative” coordinates are used – however, the Daylighting:Detailed object also uses this. Units are m.

#### Field: TypeField: Multiplier

This is the multiplier (must be integral) entered from the IDF.

#### Field: Ceiling Height {m}

This is the ceiling height entered, if any, in the IDF. Ceiling height is also heuristically calculated from the surfaces in the zone – however, not all surfaces need to be entered and sometimes the user would rather enter the ceiling height for the zone. If no ceiling height was entered (i.e. the default of 0), this field will be the calculated value. A minor warning message will be issued if the calculated value is significantly different than the entered value. Units are m.

#### Field: Volume {m3}

Like the ceiling height, this user can also enter this value in the IDF. Volume is also heuristically calculated using the ceiling height (entered or calculated) as well as the calculated floor area (see later field).

#### Field: Part of Total Building Area

This field displays “Yes” when the zone is to be considered part of the total building floor area or “No” when it’s not to be considered. This consideration has no impact on simulation but on reporting. Namely, when the value is “no”, the zone is not part of the Total Floor Area as shown in the Annual Building Utility Performance Summary tables. In addition, when “No” is specified, the area is excluded from both the conditioned floor area and the total floor area in the Building Area sub table and the Normalized Metrics sub tables.

#### Description of the Detailed Surfaces Report(s)

The preceding excerpt includes the surface details *and* vertices. You can also obtain the report with *just* the details or *just* the vertices.

**Line 1:**! &lt;Zone/Shading Surfaces&gt;**,**&lt;Zone Name&gt;/\#Shading Surfaces,\# Surfaces, Vertices are shown starting at Upper-Left-Corner =&gt; Counter-Clockwise =&gt; World Coordinates

When a line is shown with the comment character (!) in the first position, it signifies a informational “header” record for the report. In addition, “Line 1” is also a header for the subsequent “real” surface lines.

#### Field: &lt;Zone/Shading Surfaces&gt;

This field is a dual purpose field. For beginning of the Shading Surfaces, it will show “Shading\_Surfaces”. At each Zone, it will show “Zone\_Surfaces”.

#### Field: &lt;Zone Name&gt;/\#Shading Surfaces

This field is a dual purpose field. It will either show the Zone Name of the subsequent surfaces or the “Number of Shading Surfaces” for the entire building.

#### Field: \# Surfaces

This field, then, specifies the number of surfaces of the type (zone or shading) that will follow.

The example lines illustrate:

Shading\_Surfaces,Number of Shading Surfaces,   10

Zone\_Surfaces,HEARTLAND AREA,   35

Line 2 shows the full detail of each surface record with Line 3 used for illustrating the units of individual fields (as appropriate).

The first four fields (&lt;HeatTransfer/ShadingSurface&gt;,Surface Name, Surface Class, Base Surface) are included in all the Surface reports (Details, Vertices, Details with Vertices).

#### Field: &lt;HeatTransfer/Shading/Frame/Divider\_Surface&gt;

For shading surfaces, this will be a constant “Shading\_Surface”. For heat transfer surfaces, this will be a constant “HeatTransfer\_Surface”. For Frame and Divider Surfaces, it will be a constant “Frame/Divider\_Surface” with the proper type showing in the Surface Class.

#### Field: Surface Name

This field will contain the actual surface name as entered in the IDF.

#### Field: Surface Class

This field contains the surface class (e.g. Window, Door, Wall, Roof) as entered in the IDF.

#### Field: Base Surface

This field contains the base surface name if this surface is a sub-surface (i.e. Window, Door).

#### Fields in Details and Details with Vertices report.

#### Field: Construction

This field will contain the name of the construction used for the surface. (Will be empty for shading surfaces).

#### Field: Nominal U (w/o film coefs)

A nominal thermal conductance for the surface is calculated for the surface. It does not include interior or exterior film coefficients as this is calculated during the simulation and is dependent on several factors that may change during the simulation time period. Units for this field are W/m<sup>2</sup>-K.

For windows, no value is reported because the film coefficients cannot be removed from the U-value.

#### Field: Nominal U (with film coefs)

A nominal thermal conductance for the surface is calculated for the surface, including film coefficients. Units for this field are W/m<sup>2</sup>-K.

For opaque surfaces, interior and exterior film coefficients are added to the surface construction based on the prescribed R-values for interior and exterior film coefficients as found in ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix A, and shown below:  The SI values are the exact values used inside EnergyPlus.

NOTE:  The resulting "Nominal U with film coefs" is only for comparison purposes with the ASHRAE 90.1 requirements. Actual film coefficients are calculated during the simulation and are dependent on several factors that may change during the simulation time period.

For windows, the "Nominal U with film coefs" is calculated using the following assumptions from the WINDOW 5 program (also NFRC winter conditions):

- Indoor air temperature = 21 C (69.8 F)

- Outdoor air temperature = -18 C (-.4 F)

- Exterior film coefficient =  26 W/m<sup>2</sup> (4.58 ft<sup>2</sup>-F-hr/BTU)

- Interior film coefficient = Calculated by EnergyPlus convection algorithm

- No incident solar beam radiation

#### Field: Area (Net)

When surfaces are entered, the gross area of the surface is calculated from the vertices (except for Internal Mass where it is entered directly). As net area is needed in the calculations, any sub-surfaces to the primary surface are subtracted from the original gross area. This field will show the final “net” area for the surface. For example, walls with windows will have the multiplier (of the window) \* window area subtracted from the gross amount. Likewise, any divider area (including multipliers) for the window will be subtracted. Units for this field are m<sup>2</sup>.

#### Field: Area (Gross)

This field shows the gross area of the surface. Units for this field are m<sup>2</sup>.

#### Field: Area (Sunlit Calc)

This field shows the net area for the purposes of sunlit/shading calculations. For these, only 1 unit of a multiplied window/door is subtracted from the gross area of a wall that the window/door is on. This net area includes the *frame area* (if any) for the windows on the wall. For windows, this value includes the divider area of the window. Thus for both frames and dividers, there will be a \* in this field – since the areas are included in the wall/window areas. Units for this field are m<sup>2</sup>.

#### Field: Azimuth

Using the specified vertices for the surface (and order of entry), EnergyPlus can determine the outward facing normal angle for the surface. That angle is displayed in this field. Units for this field are degrees.

#### Field: Tilt

Using the specified vertices for the surface (and order of entry), EnergyPlus can determine the tilt of the surface with respect to “horizontal”. That angle is displayed in this field. Units for this field are degrees.

#### Field: ~Width

This field (approximate width of the surface) is calculated and filled by EnergyPlus from the entered vertices. Some parts of EnergyPlus use a width and height rather than the more detailed vertex/area calculations. Units for this field are m.

#### Field: ~Height

This field (approximate height of the surface) is calculated and filled by EnergyPlus from the entered vertices. Some parts of EnergyPlus use a width and height rather than the more detailed vertex/area calculations. Units for this field are m.

#### Field: Reveal

This field is calculated for sub-surfaces with respect to their base surfaces using the entered vertices, plane of the two surfaces, and distance between the planes. Reveal may be important in shading of windows, in particular. Units for this field are m.

#### Field: &lt;ExtBoundCondition&gt;

This field shows the exterior boundary condition for the surface. If this is a surface that is “external” the values will be **ExternalEnvironment** or **Ground**. If this surface is an interzone surface, this value will be the surface name in the “other” zone. If this surface is an internal surface, this value will be the same as the surface name. If this is a special surface with “Other Side Coefficients”, the value will be the OtherSideCoefficient name (see description of OtherSideCoefficient reporting later in this document). If this is a special surface with “Other Side Condition Model”, the value will be the OtherSideConditionModel name.

#### Field: &lt;ExtConvCoeffCalc&gt;

The value for this field will be a descriptor of the External Convection Coefficient calculation. If this surface uses Other Side Coefficients, this field will display **N/A-OSC**. If this surface uses Other Side Condition Model, this field will display **N/A-OSCM**. Ground surfaces will display **N/A-Ground**. If this is an interior or inter-zone surface, it will display **Other/Same Surface Int Conv**. If a schedule is used, it will display **User Supplied Schedule.** If a constant value is supplied by the user, it will display **User Supplied Value**. The standard values may also be displayed here (e.g. **ASHRAEDetailed**).

#### Field: &lt;IntConvCoeffCalc&gt;

The value for this field will be a descriptor of the Internal Convection Coefficient calculation. If a schedule is used, it will display **User Supplied Schedule.** If a constant value is supplied by the user, it will display **User Supplied Value**. The standard values may also be displayed here (e.g. **ASHRAEDetailed**).

#### Field: &lt;SunExposure&gt;

The value for this field will be **SunExposed** or **NoSun**. Internal surfaces should have NoSun exposure.

#### Field: &lt;WindExposure&gt;

The value for this field will be **WindExposed** or **NoWind**. Internal surfaces should have NoWind exposure.

#### Field: ViewFactorToGround

This value has been entered as part of the surface description. View factor to ground is described in the Input Output Reference document during the Surface:HeatTransfer description.

#### Field: ViewFactorToSky

This value is calculated by EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces.

#### Field: ViewFactorToGround-IR

This value is calculated by EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces. Shadowing surfaces are considered to have the same emissivity and temperature as the ground, so they are lumped together with the ground in calculating the ground IR view factor.

#### Field: ViewFactorToSky-IR

This value is calculated by EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces.

#### Field: \#Sides

This value is the number of sides / vertices the surface has.

#### Fields in Vertices Reports

#### Field Set: Vertex x [X {m}, Y {m}, Z {m}]

For each side of the surface, the vertices are shown in three separate fields (comma separated) in the EnergyPlus “standard” coordinate order (Upper Left Corner first, Counter-Clockwise, World Coordinates). Units for each vertex is m.

<div>\[ T = C_2 T_{zone} + C_3 T_{oadb} + C_4 C_5 + C_6 T_{grnd} + C_7 W_{spd} T_{oadb}\]</div>

where:

* T = Outdoor air Temperature when Combined convective/radiative film Coeff &gt; 0
* T = Exterior Surface Temperatre when Combined convective/radiative film Coeff &lt;= 0
* Tzone  = Temperature of the zone being simulated (°C)
* Toadb  = Dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (°C)
* Tgrnd  = Temperature of the ground (°C)
* Wspd  = Outdoor wind speed (m/sec)

#### Field: Name

This is the unique name entered for the OtherSideCoefficient. Note that the surface it applies to will have this name in the &lt;ExtBoundCondition&gt; field.

#### Field: Combined convective/radiative film coefficient

This field is a trigger value. When entered as &gt;0, it is used as the combined convective/radiative film coefficient. The other fields in the OtherSideCoefficient object are used then as well: the remaining fields are used first to calculate the outdoor air temperature for the surface and then to calculate the outside surface temperature based on the outdoor air temperature and the film coefficient. If this field contains **N/A**, then the remaining fields are used to calculate the surface temperature (not the outdoor air temperature).

#### Field: User selected Constant Temperature

This field is a temperature that remains a constant part of the calculation either of the surface or outdoor air temperature. When the schedule option is used, this field will show **N/A**. The parameter in the equation for this or the schedule value is ***C5***.

#### Field: Coefficient modifying the constant temperature term

This field is multiplied to the previous field when a simple number is entered. This parameter is shown as ***C4*** in the equation. This parameter is dimensionless. The value of this parameter should be 1.0 if a schedule is used to set ***C5***.

#### Field: Coefficient modifying the external dry bulb temperature term

This field defines a constant coefficient that is applied to the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. This parameter is shown as ***C3*** in the equation. This parameter is dimensionless.

#### Field: Coefficient modifying the ground temperature term

This field defines a constant coefficient that is applied to the ground temperature. This parameter is shown as ***C6*** in the equation. This parameter is dimensionless.

#### Field: Coefficient modifying the wind speed term {s/m}

This field defines a constant coefficient that is applied to the product of the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the wind speed. This parameter is shown as ***C7*** in the equation. This parameter has dimensions of inverse velocity or s/m.

#### Field: Coefficient modifying the zone air temperature term

This field defines a constant coefficient that is applied to the temperature of the zone to which this surface belongs. This parameter is shown as ***C2*** in the equation. This parameter is dimensionless.

#### Field: Constant Temperature Schedule Name

This field is used to supply a schedule name. That schedule supplies the “constant” temperature value ***C5***. Note that the value of the ***C4*** field should normally be 1.0 if a schedule is used for ***C5***. If this field contains a value, then constant temperature field will be **N/A** in this report.

### Opaque Constructions

#### Description of the Opaque Construction Report

The Opaque Construction report has 3 parts for each construction.

Part 1 is the construction name along with some derived values for the entire construction (i.e. Thermal Conductance) as well as noting other details about the surface (\# CTFs, \#  Layers).

Part 2 shows the material layers for the construction. This is essentially just an echo of the entered properties of the materials from the IDF.

Part 3 shows the CTFs as calculated for the Construction. CTFs are described more completely in the Engineering Reference document.

#### Fields in Part 1 – Opaque Construction Report

#### Field: &lt;Construction&gt;

This will be filled with the constant “Construction” for each Construction line.

#### Field: Construction Name

This is the name of the construction as entered in the IDF.

#### Field: \#Layers

This is the number of material layers inferred from the construction entry in the IDF. Material layers are listed “outside” to “inside” of the construction. This, of course, depends on the placement of the surface in the building – the “outside” of an internal surface is the layer that is closest to whatever the surface touches whereas the “inside” of an internal surface is the layer that shows in the surface’s “zone”. The outside of an external surface is the layer that faces the outside environment and, again, the inside is the layer that shows in the zone.

#### Field: \#CTFs

This is the calculated number of CTFs (Conduction Transfer Functions). The conduction transfer functions are temperature and flux coefficients that characterize the thermal properties of the wall.

#### Field: Time Step

The "timestep" in the construction line is the timestep at which the CTFs are valid. Because CTFs for certain constructions might not be stable at the user specified timestep (might be too "heavy" from a thermal mass standpoint), this may be different from the zone timestep (specified in “TimeStep in Hour”). In all cases though, this will be greater than or equal to the zone timestep. If the timestep for the construction is greater than the zone timestep, E+ will use interpolated histories to solve for the surface heat balances for this surface (see discussion on interpolated histories in the [Engineering Reference](file:///E:\Docs4PDFs\EngineeringDoc.pdf) document).

#### Field: Thermal Conductance

This is the nominal thermal conductance of the construction calculated without film coefficients. Units are w/m<sup>2</sup>-K.

#### Field: Outer Thermal Absorptance

This will be the thermal absorptance of the outer material layer.

#### Field: Inner Thermal Absorptance

This will be the thermal absorptance of the inner material layer.

#### Field: Outer Solar Absorptance

This will be the solar absorptance of the outer material layer.

#### Field: Inner Solar Absorptance

This will be the solar absorptance of the inner material layer.

#### Field: Roughness

The construction takes on the roughness from the outer material layer. Roughness is used in several parts of external environment calculations.

#### Fields in Part 2 – Opaque Construction Report

**Line 2:** ! &lt;Material&gt;,Material Name,Thickness {m},Conductivity {w/m-K},Density {kg/m3},Specific Heat {J/kg-K},ThermalResistance {m2-K/w}

#### Field: Material Name

This is the name of the material as entered in the IDF.

#### Field: Thickness

This is the entered thickness of the material. Units are m.

#### Field: Conductivity

For Material:Regular materials, this will be the entered conductivity in w/m-K. For Material:Regular-R materials, this will be shown as 0.0.

#### Field: Density

For Material:Regular materials, this will be the entered density in kg/m<sup>3</sup>. For Material:Regular-R materials, this will be shown as 0.0.

#### Field: Specific Heat

For Material:Regular materials, this will be the entered specific heat in J/kg-K. For Material:Regular-R materials, this will be shown as 0.0.

#### Field: Thermal Resistance

For Material:Regular-R materials, this is the entered thermal resistance in m<sup>2</sup>-K/w. For Material:Regular materials, this is the calculated thermal resistance based on the other properties.

**Line 3:** ! &lt;Material:Air&gt;,Material Name,ThermalResistance {m2-K/w}

In this version of part 2, only the thermal resistance of the air layer is entered by the user and displayed in the report.

#### Field: &lt;Material:Air&gt;

This will be filled with the constant “Material:Air” for each material layer line.

#### Field: Material Name

This is the name of the material as entered in the IDF.

#### Field: Thermal Resistance

This is the entered thermal resistance in m<sup>2</sup>-K/w.

#### Fields in Part 3 – Opaque Construction Report

**Line 4:** ! &lt;CTF&gt;,Time,Outside,Cross,Inside,Flux (except final one)

In part 3, the CTF calculations are shown. It is necessary to use the conduction transfer functions labeled "Inside" and "Cross" to calculate the heat flux at the inside surface and the conduction transfer functions labeled "Outside" and "Cross" to calculate the heat flux at the outside surface. Inside and outside coefficients will be identical for symmetric walls.

Conduction through constructions such as walls, roofs, floors, etc. is generally characterized as one-dimensional and transient within EnergyPlus. The solution to this partial differential equation results in "conduction transfer functions" or CTFs. In a CTF equation, the current heat transfer flux due to conduction through a construction is a function of the current temperature at either face of the surface as well as the history of temperatures at either face and the history of conductive fluxes at this face. CTFs are a simplification of response factors which are based solely on temperature histories and require an "infinite" history. The inclusion of heat flux history terms reduces the overall number of terms in the equation for conductive flux significantly, resulting in a more efficient solution.

For each unique combination of materials, there are a unique set of CTFs. While there are other procedures to determine the CTFs for a particular construction, EnergyPlus uses a state-space method (see conduction transfer function documentation) to obtain the CTF coefficients. These coefficients are calculated once at the beginning of the simulation and are constant for a particular construction. The CTF equation itself is a linear equation with these constant coefficients.

Conduction heat transfer flux at the outside face of a particular surface is a function of the construction of the surface (which leads to the CTF coefficients), the current and previous temperatures at both the inside and outside face of the surface, and the previous conduction heat transfer fluxes at the outside surface. The CTF coefficients that would be used in this equation would be the "Outside" (multiplied by the temperature history at the outside face) terms, the "Cross" (multiplied by the temperature history at the inside face) terms, and the "Flux" (multiplied by the flux history at the outside face) terms. Solving for the conductive flux at the inside surface would require the use of the "Inside" (multiplied by the temperature history at the inside face) terms, the "Cross" (multiplied by the temperature history at the outside face) terms, and the "Flux" (multiplied by the flux history at the inside face) terms. A textual example is given below for illustration purposes:

Current Outside Conductive Flux = (Outside Term 0) \* (Current Outside Face Temperature)

                                 +(Outside Term 1) \* (Previous Outside Face Temperature)

                                 +(Outside Term 2) \* (Outside Face Temperature 2 Time Steps Ago)

                                 +(Outside Term 3) \* (Outside Face Temperature 3 Time Steps Ago)

                                 + ...

                                 +(Cross Term 0) \* (Current Inside Face Temperature)

                                 +(Cross Term 1) \* (Previous Inside Face Temperature)

                                 +(Cross Term 2) \* (Inside Face Temperature 2 Time Steps Ago)

                                 +(Cross Term 3) \* (Inside Face Temperature 3 Time Steps Ago)

                                 + ...

                                 +(Flux Term 1) \* (Previous Outside Face Flux)

                                 +(Flux Term 2) \* (Outside Face Flux 2 Time Steps Ago)

                                 +(Flux Term 3) \* (Outside Face Flux 3 Time Steps Ago)

                                 + ...



The number of terms is based on the CTF coefficient calculation routine and is related to the amount of thermal mass contained within a particular construction. Actual signs (positive or negative) of various terms in the preceding equation will vary based on their definition and use within the equation. Those interested in more details on the use and calculation of CTFs are encouraged to read the Engineering Documentation.

#### Field: &lt;CTF&gt;

This will be filled with the constant “CTF” for each CTF coefficient line.

#### Field: Time

This field "time" refers to the history term to which the coefficients are applied. The last line is the "zero" term that gets applied to the current values of temperatures. The line with a "1" refers to the temperatures and fluxes from the previous timestep--previous as in time minus one timestep. Timestep, in this case, is defined by the construction timestep (see description on “Fields in Part 1 – Opaque Construction Report”) *not* the zone timestep. Lines with other values are for previous timesteps at t-n(timestep). These are the terms that are used to model conduction through a construction.

### Sizing Information

The sizing information in the .eio file reflects the inputs and results for the zone, system and plant (component). Actual fields/details included depend on the “autosize” inputs.

#### Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation

**! &lt;Load Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation Averaging Window&gt;, Value**

 Load Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation Averaging Window,    1

#### Field: Load Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation Averaging Window

The number of load timesteps in the zone design flow sequence averaging window. The default is 1, in which case the calculated zone design flow rates are averaged over the load timestep.

The zone design air flow rate calculation is performed assuming a potentially infinite supply of heating or cooling air at a fixed temperature. Thus, the calculated design air flow rate will always be able to meet any load or change in load no matter how large or abrupt. In reality air flow rates are limited by duct sizes and fan capacities. The idealized zone design flow calculation may result in unrealistically large flow rates, especially if the user is performing the sizing calculations using thermostat schedules with night setup or setback. The calculated zone design flow rates are always averaged over the load timestep. The user may want to perform a broader average to mitigate the effect of thermostat setup and setback and prevent the warm up or cool down flow rates from dominating the design flow rate calculation. Specifying the width of the averaging window allows the user to do this.

For example, if the load calculation timestep is 15 minutes and the user specifies the *timesteps in averaging window*to be 4, the zone design air flows will be averaged over a time period of 1 hour. Specifying 8 would result in averaging over a 2 hour period.

#### Field:  Component Name

This field shows the name of the component.

#### Field:  Input Field Description

This field shows the field description/variable with units.  When using HVAC Sizing Simulation for advanced sizing methods, there are two versions of the report for each component that might be affected.  With HVAC Sizing Simulation, there is a first size value reported, which is the result of the Ideal Loads Sizing Simulation, and there is the final value after all the Sizing Passes have completed.  This input field description will have “Initial” prepended to the description to indicate that this is the first size, the same report without “Initial” is the final size. Note that with HVAC Sizing Simulation, these reports will occur much later in the simulation and hence appear further down in the .eio file.

The refrigeration output in the **eplusout.eio** file shows the number of refrigeration compressor racks, detailed refrigeration systems, detailed transcritical refrigeration systems, and secondary refrigeration systems found in the input data file (IDF). Additional information is shown for each compressor rack and the refrigerated case(s) and walk-in(s) connected to each compressor rack. For the detailed systems, additional information is shown for each refrigerated case(s), walk-in(s), cascade loads, secondary loads, mechanical subcooler loads, compressors, condenser, and mechanical and liquid suction heat exchanger subcoolers connected to the system. For the detailed transcritical refrigeration systems, additional information is shown for each refrigerated case(s), walk-in(s), compressor and gas cooler connected to the system. For secondary refrigeration systems, additional information is shown for each refrigerated case(s) and walk-in(s) connected to the system. For walk-ins, additional information is shown for each zone exchanging energy with that walk-in.

The refrigeration “header” records (lines starting with an “!”) precede all the data lines. The data lines are grouped, showing the number of refrigeration compressor racks specified in the input data file followed by lines that reflect the information for each refrigeration compressor rack followed by the information for each refrigerated case and walk-in connected to this rack. The number of detailed systems is followed by a group of data lines describing the input values for the detailed refrigeration systems and similarly for the secondary refrigeration systems.

This output reflects information for the specified refrigeration equipment along with entries from the IDF (or default data for blank fields). The data are preceded by a description (i.e. \#Refrigeration Compressor Racks, Refrigeration Compressor Rack, Refrigerated Case, \#Orphaned Refrigerated Cases, and Orphaned Refrigerated Case) followed by the information associated with each description.

### View Factor Info

A semi-debugging, informational report on View Factors for each zone/surface is available when you add **Output:Diagnostics,DisplayAdvancedVariables;** to your input file.

After EnergyPlus receives the geometry information for the building, it calculates the view factors and grey interchange information for each zone and surface. These are used to calculate the interior radiant exchange between surfaces. The first set is called the approximate view factors; then, a deeper evaluation of the zone’s geometry and surfaces is performed to see if corrections need to be applied. Three sets of values are provided for the user’s information.

! &lt;Surface View Factor Check Values&gt;,ZoneName,Original Check Value,Calculated Fixed Check Value,Final Check Value

Surface View Factor Check Values,ZONE ONE,8.881784E-016,8.637788E-004,8.881784E-016

#### Field: Zone Name

This is the zone name for the values.

#### Field: Original Check Value

Original check value as submitted to the “Test and Check” routine. This value represents the Sum of the N (number of surfaces) by N matrix – the Number of Surfaces. Ideally, it should be very close to zero. The original check value could come from either the User inputting the view factors for the zone or the approximate view factor calculation in EnergyPlus.

#### Field: Calculated Fixed Check Value

This is the value of the view factor matrix (i.e. SUM(NXNmatrix – N) after the fix routine has applied them.

#### Field: Final Check Value

This value should match one of the previous values and indicate whether the original matrix or the modfied/fixed matrix will be used in the calculations.

### View Factor Details

View factors for zones (surfaces) can be entered into the input file (object: ZoneProperty:UserViewFactors) if desired. Or they can be reported from the input file. The following describes the reporting of these view factors. You can report the surface view factor information by using:

Output:Surfaces:List,ViewFactorInfo;

This triggers EnergyPlus to produce a special output section in the file eplusout.eio. This file, which is csv format, can be opened in Excel, and will show detailed information about the surfaces in all the zones.

In order to get user view factors ready for inclusion in an input file, several steps much be taken. *First, because EnergyPlus has a data structure for zones that only is defined at initialization, it is necessary to use EnergyPlus to determine the surface numbers (i,j) before a UserViewFactors object can be constructed.* (This is a known defect – a new object is being defined that will make this unnecessary). THIS STILL NEEDS TO BE REVISED BASE ON IF WE GO FOR NEW INPUT OR NOT.

#### Surface View Factor – Zone Information

This line provides the zone name and the number of surfaces (heat transfer) in the zone. This information may be redundant with other reports in the eio file. It is included here to assist users who wish to use the auxiliary view factor program to generate view factors.

#### Surface View Factor – Surface Information

These lines provide the surface information for each surface in the zone. This includes the name, class, area, azimuth (outward facing normal angle), the tilt angle, the thermal emissivity, the number of sides to the surface and the vertices.  Again, this information may be redundant with other reports in the eio file. It is included here to assist users who wish to use the auxiliary view factor program to generate view factors.

#### Approximate or User Input View Factors

This section/lines provide the original view factors after either user input or approximate calculation. Surface name and class information are given again as well as each row sum (these should sum to 1, ideally) and then the view factors to other surfaces shown in columnar order.

#### Final View Factors

This section/lines shows view factors after they have been corrected for reciprocity and completeness. Correction may be necessary to make sure any two surfaces exchange radiation reciprocally, that is, the radiation leaving one surface directed at another surface is the same as the amount of radiation arriving at the other surface, and that the sum of all the radiant energy exchanges in the zone is zero. If the user input view factors are perfect in these characteristics, the correction will not change them. The displayed lines show what view factors will be used during the simulation.

#### Script F Factors

Finally, grey interchange coefficients are presented. These are the coefficients that are used to calculate the radiant energy exchange between the surfaces in the zone. They are calculated to include reflection from intervening surfaces in the zone.

### Warmup Days Line

As described elsewhere, EnergyPlus simulates the first day of each simulation period until it reaches “convergence”. This data line will show how many warm up days were required to reach that state.

! &lt;Environment:WarmupDays&gt;, NumberofWarmupDays

Environment:WarmupDays,  6

#### Field: &lt;Environment:WarmupDays&gt;

This is a constant that will display “Environment:WarmupDays”.

#### Field: NumberofWarmupDays

This field will show the number of days required to reach the convergence state for the simulation.

### Warmup Convergence Outputs

Warmup is performed for each environment being simulated. When a file passes convergence, no warnings are shown.  However, when it doesn’t a warning appears in the eplusout.err file, for example:

CheckWarmupConvergence: Loads Initialization, Zone="BACKROOM" did not converge after 25 warmup days.

See Warmup Convergence Information in .eio file for details

...Environment(RunPeriod)="Phoenix Sky Harbor Intl Ap AZ USA TMY3 WMO\#=722780"

..Max Temp Comparison = 8.46E-005 vs Temperature Convergence Tolerance=0.40 - Pass Convergence

..Min Temp Comparison = 7.05E-002 vs Temperature Convergence Tolerance=0.40 - Pass Convergence

..Max Heat Load Comparison = 9.8513E-002 vs Loads Convergence Tolerance=4.00E-002 - Fail Convergence

..Max Cool Load Comparison = 8.2481E-003 vs Loads Convergence Tolerance=4.00E-002 - Pass Convergence

### Warmup Convergence Information

Warmup convergence information reflects the warmup days calculations and whether or not the zone has reached “convergence”. Warmup calculations are done for each environment (e.g. each sizing period simulated, each run period simulated). Reference the building parameters on Minimum and Maximum Number of Warmup Days as well as Loads and Temperature convergence Tolerance. The file contains two possible flavors of warmup information: summary and detailed.

### Summary Warmup Convergence Information

This field indicates **Pass** or **Fail** for the heating load criteria.

#### Field: Cooling Load Pass/Fail Convergence

This field indicates **Pass** or **Fail** for the cooling load criteria.

### Detailed Warmup Convergence Information

Detailed warmup convergence information is reported if you add an Output:Diagnostics, ReportDetailedWarmupConvergence; object statement to the input file. It does not include the current environment name or type as it is displayed immediately after the environment details.

#### Field: Zone Name

This field will show the name of individual zone.

#### Field: Time Step

This field will show the value of time step.

#### Field: Hour of Day

This field will show the value of hour of the day.

#### Field: Warmup Temperature Difference

This field will provide a mean air temperature comparison between the second to last and the last warmup day for the simulation.  In other words, it will provide a DT between, for example, 9:10AM on the second to last warmup day and 9:10AM on the last warmup day. The value will be on a zone-by-zone basis for each time step in the simulation.

#### Field: Warmup Load Difference

This field is similar to the previous field except that it displays the heating or cooling load of the zone in question.

eplusout.end
------------

This is a simple one line synopsis of the simulation. Successful or Not Successful, including number of errors/warnings:

EnergyPlus Completed Successfully-- 8 Warning; 0 Severe Errors

If no file is produced, it is really *not* successful and EnergyPlus has probably crashed during the run. This file and its contents are intended for interfaces that will put friendly front-ends onto EnergyPlus. This file is also used by the EP-Launch program so that it can determine if the run was successful or not – if not, the user should review the eplusout.err file. (Actually, the eplusout.err file should always be reviewed but often is ignored in haste to view the results.)

eplusout.epmidf
---------------

If you use an EPMacro file (usual extension is .imf) as your basis for input, then this file is the “idf” that the EPMacro program produces.

eplusout.epmdet
---------------

If you use an EPMacro file (usual extension is .imf) as your basis for input, then this file is the details of the EPMacro run (including any error messages).

eplusout.err
------------

This file is *very important* to every simulation run. All of the warnings, errors, etc that occur during the run will show up in this file. They may show up in other files as well. The first line of the error file is also significant:

Program Version,EnergyPlus, &lt;version&gt;,IDD\_Version &lt;version&gt;

This shows not only the current version of the program but the “version” of the Energy+.idd file that was used.

Table 3. EnergyPlus Errors

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr>
<th>Error Level</th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warning</td>
<td>Take note</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Severe</td>
<td>Should Fix</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fatal</td>
<td>Program will abort</td>
</tr>
</table>

The previous table illustrates the three levels of errors that occur in the eplusout.err file. Several other message lines may be shown as well. For example:

\*\* Warning \*\* World Coordinate System selected.  Any non-zero Building/Zone North Axes or non-zero Zone Origins are ignored.

\*\*   ~~~   \*\* These may be used in daylighting reference point coordinate calculations  but not in normal geometry inputs.

The line that includes the “~~~” is a “continue” error line. It continues from the previous line to help describe the context of the error.

Some common errors, their consequences, and what to do about them follows:

\*\* Severe  \*\* IP: Possible incorrect IDD File

\*\* Severe  \*\* IP: Possible Invalid Numerics

\*\*  Fatal  \*\* IP: Errors occurred on processing IDF file. Preceding condition(s) cause termination.

The previous errors cause program termination. The most likely cause is that you have an “old” IDF and have not converted it to work with the current version of the program. In this case, you will likely has some other hints such as alphas in numeric fields or too many fields in an object. Energyplus also has built in range checking:

\*\* Severe  \*\* Out of range value Numeric Field\#7 (Sky Clearness), value=100.00000, range={&gt;=0.0 and &lt;=1.2}, in SIZINGPERIOD:DESIGNDAY=CHICAGO ANN CLG .4% CONDNS WB=&gt;MDB

If these occur during the initial processing of the IDF, you will see a termination clause:

\*\* Severe  \*\* IP: Out of "range" values found in input

\*\* Severe  \*\* IP: Out of "range" values and/or blank required fields found in input

\*\*  Fatal  \*\* IP: Errors occurred on processing IDF file. Preceding condition(s) cause termination.

The error message should supply you with enough information to find the line with the error. More details on error message formatting and some standard error messages are described in the Tips & Tricks document.

eplusout.eso
------------

The standard output file from EnergyPlus. It includes all the applicable variables selected with the “Output:Variable” commands as well as those with the “Output:Meter” commands. All levels of frequency of reporting are included intermingled as occurs in the running of the program. The form of the file is a data dictionary, followed by the data.

In this case, the dictionary portion of the file comes first followed by an “end of data dictionary line” and then the data makes up the rest of the file.

Thus, the basic structure of the standard output file is:

Data Dictionary Information

End of Data Dictionary

Data

…

Data

End of Data

As with the IDF structure, there are rules associated with the interpretation of the standard output data dictionary. These rules are summarized as follows:

- The first item on each line is an integer which represents the “report code”. This “report code” will be listed in the data section where it will also be the first item on each line, identifying the data. Only 2 lines in the output file will not have an integer as the first item (“End of Data Dictionary” and “End of Data” lines).

- The second item on each line is also an integer. This integer corresponds to the number of items left on the dictionary line. Each string consists of a variable name and units in square brackets. Square brackets are required for all strings. If there are no units associated with a particular variable, then there are no characters between the brackets.

Six standard items appear at the start of every EnergyPlus Standard Output File Data Dictionary:

Program Version,EnergyPlus &lt;version number indicated&gt;

  1,5,Environment Title[],Latitude[deg],Longitude[deg],Time Zone[],Elevation[m]

  2,6,Day of Simulation[],Month[],Day of Month[],DST Indicator[1=yes 0=no],Hour[],StartMinute[],EndMinute[],DayType

  3,3,Cumulative Day of Simulation[],Month[],Day of Month[],DST Indicator[1=yes 0=no],DayType  ! When Daily Report Variables Requested

  4,2,Cumulative Days of Simulation[],Month[]  ! When Monthly Report Variables Requested

  5,1,Cumulative Days of Simulation[] ! When Run Period Report Variables Requested

Item 0 is the program version statement.

Item 1 is produced at the beginning of each new “environment” (design day, run period).

Item 2 is produced prior to any variable reported at the timestep or hourly intervals. Hourly intervals will be shown with a start minute of 0.0 and an end minute of 60.0. Timestep intervals will show the appropriate start and end minutes.

Item 3 is produced prior to any variable reported at the daily interval.

Item 4 is produced prior to any variable reported at the monthly interval.

Item 5 is produced prior to any variable reported at the end of the “environment”.

Following these five standard lines will be the variables requested for reporting from the input file (ref. Report Variable). For example:

6,2,Environment,Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature [C] !Hourly

21,2,ZONE ONE,Zone Mean Air Temperature [C] !Hourly

22,2,ZONE ONE,Zone Total Latent Gain [J] !Hourly

26,2,ZONE ONE,Zone Lights Electric Energy [J] !Hourly

This example illustrates the non-consecutive nature of the “report codes”. Internally, EnergyPlus counts each variable that *could* be reported. This is the assigned “report code”. However, the user may not request each possible variable for reporting. Note that, currently, the requested reporting frequency is shown as a comment (!) line in the standard output file.

The data is produced when the actual simulation is performed (after the warmup days unless the Output:Diagnostics requesting ReportDuringWarmup is used). Data output is simpler in format than the data dictionary lines. From the dictionary above:

     1,DENVER COLORADO WINTER,  39.75,-104.87,  -7.00,1610.26

     2,  1, 1,21, 0, 1, 0.00,60.00,Monday

21,-17.22219

22,0.0000000E+00

26,0.0000000E+00

…

This output file can be easily turned into a form that is read into commonly used spreadsheet programs where it can be further analyzed, graphed, etc.

486,31.5855358697037

Each report variable (ref: eplusout.rdd) is assigned an identification number, as in the line:

486,2,NORTH ZONE,Zone Air Temperature [C] !Hourly

**\#486** is the id number of the Zone/Sys Air Temperature value for the North Zone.

**2** – is the number of parameters on the line

**North Zone** – the identifying “key name” for the line

**Zone Air Temperature [C]** – the actual report variable name along with units [C]

**! Hourly** – the ! is the standard comment character, information following this character reminds the user how frequently this data will appear in the following.

As another example:

Each **Output:Variable** object causes a specific number assignment for outputs. For example, you could request separate reporting for the outside temperature:

Output:Variable,\*, Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature,timestep;

Output:Variable,\*, Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature,hourly;

Output:Variable,\*, Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature,monthly;

And the following would appear in the standard output file:

6,2,Environment,Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature [C] !TimeStep

7,2,Environment,Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature [C] !Hourly

8,2,Environment,Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature [C] !Monthly [Value,Min,Day,Hour,Minute,Max,Day,Hour,Minute]

Item \# 6 will be listed following the TimeStep timestamp for each timestep. Item \#7 will be listed following an hourly timestamp. And item \#8 will be listed following a monthly timestamp and has additional fields (because it is an “average” variable) that show the minimum and maximum values with identifying times for those minimum and maximum. An excerpt will illustrate:

     2,  1, 7,21, 0, 1, 0.00,15.00,Monday** – timestep timestamp**

6,17.08889

48,21.39851

8,22.77037,15.00000,21, 4,60,32.77778,21,14,60

To interpret, the first value (\#6) is 17.09 C, \#7 is 16.76 C (average for the hour), and \#8 is 22.77 C, the average for the month with the low (minimum) of 15 C occurring on 7/21 4:60 (or 5:00) and the high (maximum) occurring on 7/21 14:60 (or 15:00).

This file contains the “meter details” for the run. This shows what report variables are on which meters and vice versa – which meters contain what report variables.

The meter details file consists of two parts:

- For report variables that are on meters, it shows all the meters that the report variable is on.  In the following example, “Meters for “ &lt;report variable \#&gt;, &lt;report variable name&gt; is shown and then the meters that accumulate the value of that variable as a “meter”.

eplusout.mtr
------------

This is the equivalent file to the eplusout.eso file but contains only the Report Meter requests. The format and style of the file is identical to the eplusout.eso file.

eplusout.rdd
------------

This file (from the **Output:VariableDictionary,regular;** and **Output:VariableDictionary,IDF;** commands) shows all the report variables along with their “availability” for the current input file. Each simulation *may have* different output variables though some are constant (for example the environmental/outdoor variables! A user must first run the simulation (at least semi-successfully) before the available output variables are known. This output file is available in two flavors: regular (listed as they are in the Input Output Reference) and IDF (ready to be copied and pasted into your Input File). Once this file is generated, the IDF editor can use them for Output:Variable keys. You can also ask for the outputs to be sorted by name.

Output:VariableDictionary,regular,Name;

“**Zone**” variables are calculated and can be reported after each Zone/Heat Balance timestep (ref: TimeSteps in Hour command). “**HVAC**” variables are calculated and can be reported with each variable HVAC timestep. “Average” variables will be averaged over the time interval being reported whereas “sum” variables are summed over that time interval.

There are two mitigating factors for this output variable list. One is the “Advanced Report Variables” and the other is the “Create Minimal Surface Variables”.

### Normal Output Variables – regular format

! Program Version, &lt;version&gt;, &lt;date/time of run&gt;,IDD\_Version &lt;IDD version&gt;

! Output:Variable Objects (applicable to this run)

Output:Variable,\*,Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature,hourly; !- Zone Average [C]

Output:Variable,\*,Site Outdoor Air Dewpoint Temperature,hourly; !- Zone Average [C]

Output:Variable,\*,Site Outdoor Air Wetbulb Temperature,hourly; !- Zone Average [C]

Output:Variable,\*,Site Outdoor Air Humidity Ratio,hourly; !- Zone Average [kgWater/kgDryAir]

Output:Variable,\*,Site Outdoor Air Relative Humidity,hourly; !- Zone Average [%]

Output:Variable,\*,Site Outdoor Air Barometric Pressure,hourly; !- Zone Average [Pa]

Output:Variable,\*,Site Wind Speed,hourly; !- Zone Average [m/s]

Output:Variable,\*,Site Wind Direction,hourly; !- Zone Average [deg]

### Advanced Output Variables

The DisplayAdvancedReportVariables key to the Output:Diagnostics object adds a number of variables that may need special handling or understanding of the users. Search on the Input Output Reference document for DisplayAdvancedReportVariables for more details.

eplusout.mdd
------------

This file (from the **Output:VariableDictionary,regular;** and **Output:VariableDictionary,IDF;** commands) shows all the report meters along with their “availability” for the current input file. A user must first run the simulation (at least semi-successfully) before the available output meters are known. This output file is available in two flavors: **regular** (listed as they are in the Input Output Reference) and **IDF** (ready to be copied and pasted into your Input File). Once this file is generated, the IDF editor can use them for Output:Meter and Output:CumulativeMeter keys.

Note that meters are always accumulated to the Zone timestep. They are always “summed” variables.

### Meter Variables – regular format

Program Version,EnergyPlus &lt;version&gt;, &lt;date time of run&gt;,IDD\_Version &lt;IDD Version&gt;

Var Type (reported timestep),Var Report Type,Variable Name [Units]

Zone,Meter,Electricity:Facility [J]

Zone,Meter,Electricity:Building [J]

Zone,Meter,Electricity:Zone:SOUTHZONE\_1STFLOOR [J]

Zone,Meter,InteriorLights:Electricity [J]

Zone,Meter,InteriorLights:Electricity:Zone:SOUTHZONE\_1STFLOOR [J]

Zone,Meter,GeneralLights:InteriorLights:Electricity [J]

&lt;reduced&gt;



Note that custom meters also appear on this file:

Zone,Meter,MYGENERALLIGHTS [J]

Zone,Meter,MYBUILDINGELECTRIC [J]

Zone,Meter,MYBUILDINGOTHER [J]

### Meter Variables – regular format – sorted by name

The meter variable file can also be sorted by name. If the rdd is sorted by name, then the meter mdd file will be as well.

Program Version,EnergyPlus &lt;version&gt;, &lt;date time of run&gt;,IDD\_Version &lt;IDD Version&gt;

Var Type (reported time step),Var Report Type,Variable Name [Units]

Zone,Meter,Carbon Equivalent:Facility [kg]

Zone,Meter,CarbonEquivalentEmissions:Carbon Equivalent [kg]

Zone,Meter,Cogeneration:ElectricityNet [J]

Zone,Meter,Cogeneration:ElectricityPurchased [J]

Zone,Meter,Cogeneration:ElectricitySurplusSold [J]

&lt;snip&gt;

### Meter Variables – IDF format

This report produces the variable names in a form that are ready to be merged into an input file. By design, hourly reporting is selected – replace this with your desired frequency. An example of the results:

! Program Version, &lt;version&gt;, &lt;date/time of run&gt;, IDD\_Version &lt;IDD version&gt;

! Output:Meter Objects (applicable to this run)

Output:Meter,DistrictHeating:Facility,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter:Cumulative,DistrictHeating:Facility,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter,DistrictHeating:HVAC,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter:Cumulative,DistrictHeating:HVAC,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter,Heating:DistrictHeating,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter:Cumulative,Heating:DistrictHeating,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter,DistrictCooling:Facility,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter:Cumulative,DistrictCooling:Facility,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter,DistrictCooling:HVAC,hourly; !- [J]

Output:Meter:Cumulative,DistrictCooling:HVAC,hourly; !- [J]

### Meter Naming Convention

To repeat some of the detail described in the Input Output Reference document:

Meter names are of three forms:

- &lt;ResourceType&gt;:&lt;name&gt;

Or

- &lt;EndUseType&gt;:&lt;ResourceType&gt;:&lt;name&gt;

Or

- &lt;EndUseSubcategory&gt;:&lt;EndUseType&gt;:&lt;ResourceType&gt;:&lt;name&gt;.

The user requests reporting by either specifying the full name above (without Units) or a “wildcard” representation of that name (to obtain all meters of a type). For example, entering “Electricity:\*” for the meter name will report on all the Electricity: meters (Electricity:Facility, Electricity:Building, Electricity:Zone:Resistive Zone, Electricity:Zone:East Zone, Electricity:North Zone in the example above). Both the resource types and end-use types are set within the program by the developers. End-use subcategories are user-defined and are an input field for certain objects.

To summarize the previous paragraph, you could use:

Output:Meter,Electricity:\*;

To get the same outputs as if you had entered:

Output:Meter,Electricity:Facility;

Output:Meter,Electricity:Building;

Output:Meter,Electricity:Zone:South Zone;

Output:Meter,Electricity:Zone:East Zone;

Output:Meter,Electricity:North Zone;

From a three zone file that had no HVAC electricity (i.e., had only electric equipment or lighting equipment in an uncontrolled three zone building).

Current resource types are shown in the table below:

Table 4. Table of Metered Resource  Types

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr>
 <th>Utility/Fuel Types</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Electricity</td>
 <td>Gas</td>
 <td>Gasoline</td>
 <td>Diesel</td>
 <td>Coal</td>
 <td>FuelOil\#1</td>
 <td>FuelOil\#2</td>
 <td>Propane</td>

 <td>Steam</td>
 <td>DistrictCooling</td>
 <td>DistrictHeating</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr>
<th>Other Resource Types</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EnergyTransfer</td>
</tr>
</table>

The end use types are shown in the following table (note that certain end use types apply only to the EnergyTransfer resource):

The end use types are shown in the following table:

Table 5. End Use Category Types

<table class="table table-striped">
 <tr>
  <th>End Use Types</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>InteriorLights</td>
  <td>ExteriorLights</td>
  <td>InteriorEquipment</td>
  <td>ExteriorEquipment</td>
  <td>Fans</td>
  <td>Pumps</td>
  <td>Heating</td>
  <td>Cooling</td>
  <td>HeatRejection</td>
  <td>Humidifier</td>
  <td>HeatRecovery</td>
  <td>DHW</td>
  <td>Cogeneration</td>
  <td>Refrigeration</td>
  <td>Miscellaneous</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<table class="table table-striped">
 <tr>
  <th>Additional End Use Types Only Used for EnergyTransfer</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>HeatingCoils</td>
  <td>CoolingCoils</td>
  <td>Chillers</td>
  <td>Boilers</td>
  <td>Baseboard</td>
  <td>HeatRecoveryForCooling</td>
  <td>HeatReoveryFor Heating</td>
 </tr>
</table>

Specific meter types are then used for grouping the fuel type meters:

Table 6. Overall Meter Types

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr>
<th>Meters</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Facility</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>System</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plant</td>
</tr>
</table>

Facility meters contain all the energy of a fuel type. Building meters contain the sum of each zone’s energy. System meters contain the energy from the system components. Plant meters contain the energy from the plant equipments.

Thus, the following relationships should be observed:

<div>\[ \text{Facility} = \sum\left(\text{Building} + \text{System} + \text{Plant} + \text{Exterior}\right) \]</div>

<div>\[ \text{Building} = \sum_{i}^{\#Zones} \text{Zone} \]</div>

Custom Meters, (review Input Output Reference, objects: **Meter:Custom** and **Meter:CustomDecrement**) for further requirements, are reported in the same way as pre-defined meters.

For example, one might put the Building Infiltration Heat Loss & Heat Gain on a set of custom meters:

```
  Meter:Custom,
    Building Infiltration Heat Loss,  !- Name
    Generic,             !- Fuel Type
    *,                       !- Key Name 1
    Zone Infiltration Total Heat Loss Energy;  !- Output Variable Name 1

  Meter:Custom,
    Building Infiltration Heat Gain,  !- Name
    Generic,             !- Fuel Type
    *,                       !- Key Name 1
    Zone Infiltration Total Heat Gain Energy;  !- Output Variable Name 1
```

One can then report these values the same way one reports other standard meters.



eplusout.shd
------------

This file contains details of the shadow casting, back and receiving surfaces for the building. The [Engineering Reference](file:///E:\Docs4PDFs\EngineeringReference.pdf) explains the shadowing calculations in more detail; this report file merely shows the level of interactions that the calculations will use. The report shows the Solar Distribution algorithm (in the example Full Interior and Exterior) and then proceeds to illustrate which surfaces shade (possibly) which other surfaces.

Note, a casting surface -- a shadow casting surface or general casting surface (so called in the file) -- is one that casts a shadow on other surfaces. A receiving surface - a shadow receiving surface -- is one that receives shadows from other surfaces (i.e. casting surfaces). A back surface -- an inside surface -- is one that may be partially sunlit/receive solar transmission for interior solar distribution.

An example follows:

A short discussion of contents of each of the above SQL tables is given in the sections that follow.

### Report Data

Data in the following four tables are also found in EnergyPlus’ standard output file (i.e., eplusout.eso – see that section for more information) or in EnergyPlus' eplusout.mtr (i.e. meter) output file. As with the standard output file, the “Report Variable” and “Report Meter” commands control the data in these tables.

#### ReportDataDictionary Table

The ReportDataDictionary table provides the equivalent of the dictionary portion of the ESO file (i.e., the first section of the .eso file) or eplusout.mtr. Please see the Report Variable section of the Input-Output Reference for more information.  Like in the eplusout.mtr file (see the eplusout.mtr section), only data requested by "Report Meter" commands will set isMeter to 1 or True.

#### TabularData Table

An overview of the TabularData SQL table is shown below.   The TabularData table is only output when the “SimpleAndTabular” choice is made in the Output:SQLite object.  The TabularData table contains all of the tabular report information that is typically output to one of the formats controlled by the OutputControl:Table:Style object.  This is a generic way of dumping all of the existing tabular reports to the SQLite database.  This table has many references to the companion Strings table.  The Strings table simply associates strings to an integer value for space efficiency of the database.  Tabular data is easier to query from the TabularDataWithStrings table, which is implemented as a database view that joins this table with the Strings table.

</table>

#### Strings Table

An overview of the Strings SQL table is shown below. The Strings table is only output when the “SimpleAndTabular” choice is made in the Output:SQLite object.  The Strings table simply associates strings with integers to save space in the database.



<table class="table table-striped">
<caption>Table 39. SQL Strings Table Contents</caption>
<tr>
<th>Field Name</th>
<th>Field Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>StringIndex</td>
<td>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</td>
<td>The integer primary key that uniquely identifies the string record.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>StringTypeIndex</td>
<td>INTEGER</td>
<td>A foreign key to the StringTypes table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Value</td>
<td>TEXT</td>
<td>The record’s string value.</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### StringTypes Table

An overview of the StringTypes SQL table is shown below. The StringTypes table is only output when the “SimpleAndTabular” choice is made in the Output:SQLite object.



<table class="table table-striped">

<tr>
<td>StringTypeIndex</td>
<td>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</td>
<td>The integer primary key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Value</td>
<td>TEXT</td>
<td>The record’s string value.  Currently there are 6 possible values; ReportName, ReportForString, TableName, RowName, ColumnName, and Units.  That is, entries in the Strings table are one of these types.</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### TabularDataWithStrings Table

An overview of the TabularDataWithStrings SQL table is shown below.  This table is implemented as a view of other tables and is not actually a table in the database.  This view is similar to the TabularData table except text strings are directly available in place of foreign keys to the Strings table.   The TabularDataWithStrings view is only created when the “SimpleAndTabular” choice is made in the Output:SQLite object.

An example of a SQL query to get a table out of the AnnualBuildingUtilityPerformanceSummary report is the following.

````
select \* FROM TabularDataWithStrings WHERE 
ReportName='AnnualBuildingUtilityPerformanceSummary' 
and TableName='Site and Source Energy';
````

#### Errors Table

The Errors SQL table reports errors and warnings for the simulation.  The content of this table includes most of the content of the error file.  However, it does not contain purely informational messages (e.g. not warnings or errors) and some of the error summary statistics which may be readily computed. Users should be aware that errors experienced while processing input cause EnergyPlus to exit before the SQLite output database has been initialized.  This is because the Output:SQLite object must be parsed from the input to request the database.  Therefore, failures in input processing are indicated by the absence of a SQLite output file.  The regular error or audit files must be used to identify the erroneous input objects in this case.  Because each error or warning message is expected to be unique these messages are stored directly in the Errors table and not in the Strings table.



<table class="table table-striped">

<tr>
<th>Field Name</th>

### How to Access the SQLite Data

The SQL database can be accessed in a number of ways, including via the command line, through ODBC, or through as SQLite’s API interface. SQLite uses the industry standard SQL 92 language.

#### Command Line

One of the simplest ways to access the data in the SQL database is by way of the SQL command line tool (i.e., sqlite3). A brief description of how to use sqlite3 for each computing platform is given below.

#### Windows XP and Windows Vista

While Windows does not ship with sqlite3 installed, the sqlite3 binary can be downloaded from the SQLite webpage (www.sqlite.org/download.html). After downloading the precompiled binary, install it in the EnergyPlus directory.

Once the sqlite3 executable is installed, access the program from the command line by typing “sqlite3” at the DOS prompt.

#### Linux

The sqlite3 command line tool comes preinstalled on a number of more recent Linux releases. To see if sqlite3 is available (and which version is installed), type “sqlite3 --version” from the command line. If sqlite3 is not installed, the sqlite3 binary, as well as source code, can be downloaded from the SQLite webpage (http://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and installed in the directory of your choice.

#### Macintosh OS X

The sqlite3 program comes standard on MacOS X 10.5. From the command line, type “sqlite3 --version” to see which version of sqlite3 is installed.  In order to access the database created by EnergyPlus, version 3 or later is required.

#### Accessing the Data from the Command Line

Once it has been confirmed that SQLite3 is installed on your machine, the SQL database can be accessed by typing:

```
sqlite3 <database name>
```

at the command line, where &lt;database name &gt; is the name of the SQL database (e.g., sqlite3 eplusout.sql).

The sqlite.org [website](http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html) gives examples of how sqlite3 can be used to access and output data in various formats.

#### ODBC

ODBC allows access to the SQL database from a variety of programs, including Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, and FileMaker. How to install and use ODBC drivers is outside the scope of this document, and more information can be found at the following websites:

Macintosh ODBC drivers:

http://www.actualtechnologies.com/

Windows and Linux ODBC information and drivers:

http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=SqliteOdbc

http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/

#### API

Sqlite3 includes a rich C++ API (detailed on the SQLite website [www.sqlite.org/cintro.html](http://www.sqlite.org/cintro.html)), and wrappers for the API interface are available in a variety of programming languages, including Fortran, TCL, and Ruby (see [www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=SqliteWrappers](http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=SqliteWrappers) for more information).

The columns are:

#### Field: Time

Calculation time – this will show the time steps used by the simulation and by the sizing calculation.

#### Sizing Calculation Fields

Each of the Zone Sizing output fields has the Zone Name, the Environment Name for the peak prepended to the item that has been calculated.  The four fields calculated are:

- Des Heat Load

- Des Sens Cool Load

- Des Heat Mass Flow

- Des Cool Mass Flow

These are repeated for the number of zones in the sizing calculation.

#### Field:  Des Heat Load [W]

This is the calculated design/required heating load at the time step.

#### Field:  Des Sens Cool Load [W]

This is the calculated design/required cooling load at the time step.

#### Field:  Des Heat Mass Flow [kg/s]

This is the calculated design/required heating mass flow rate at the time step.

#### Field: Des Cool Mass Flow [kg/s]

This is the calculated design/required cooling mass flow rate at the time step.

#### Line: Peak

This indicates the peak calculation (load or mass flow) over the 24 hour condensed sizing period.

#### Line: Peak Vol Flow [m3/s]

For the mass flow rates, this indicates the peak volume flow calculation (m3/s) over the 24 hour condensed sizing period.

eplusout.&lt;ext&gt;
----------------

The eplusout.csv (or txt or tab extension) is a file that can be produced by post-processing on the eplusout.eso file. EnergyPlus distributes a post-processing program (ReadVarsESO – see next section) with the installation.

eplusmtr.&lt;ext&gt;
----------------

The eplusmtr.csv (or txt or tab extension) is a file that can be produced by post-processing on the eplusout.mtr file. EnergyPlus distributes a post-processing program (ReadVarsESO – see next section) with the installation.

eplusmap.&lt;ext&gt;
----------------

The eplusmap.csv (or txt or tab extension) is a file that is generated by the Output:IlluminanceMap object. These are calculated for the Daylighting:Controls daylighting option. By default, this is a comma delimited text file (csv) that can be imported into a spreadsheet program. For example, the input for the Output:IlluminanceMap object shown below:

```
Output:IlluminanceMap,
    Daylit Map,              !- Map Name
    Daylit Zone,             !- Zone Name
    0.8,                     !- Z height {m}
    0.1,                     !- X minimum coordinate {m}
    4.9,                     !- X maximum coordinate {m}
    10,                      !- Number of X grid points
    0.1,                     !- Y minimum coordinate {m}
    9.9,                     !- Y maximum coordinate {m}
    10;                      !- Number of Y grid points
```

generates the following output in csv format when viewed with Microsoft Excel.  **Note that if the point is outside the zone a “\*” will be shown.**

![](media/image019.png)

Figure 7. Spreadsheet view of Daylight Map output

Each cell reports the illuminance (in lux) at the location specified by the (X;Y) coordinates in the column and row headers. These are XY pairs separated by a semi-colon for ease in importing into the spreadsheet. The Z coordinate of the map is shown in the title (the illuminance map is set in a plane). The date and time are indicated in the upper left cell of the map. One map is reported for every hour of the simulation.

The illuminance values are organized to allow the user to rapidly plot a visualization of the data using Microsoft Excel’s standard “3-D Column” graph. A 3-D graph is shown below for the data in a single day similar to the earlier example.

![](media/image020.png)

Figure 8. 3D Graph of Illuminance Map

The following figure illustrates a similar map for the tubular daylighting device example file that is included with the installation.

![](media/image021.png)

Figure 9. A 3D illuminance map for the tubular daylighting device file

Individual 3-D graphs can be generated for each hour of a given day and collected to generate a sequence of graphs representing the progression of daylighting conditions over the course of the day. Using additional software tools (not provided with EnergyPlus) the user can do further post-processing to link screenshots of the graphs into an animated sequence.

The daylight factors report contains the pre-calculated hourly daylight factors for the four CIE sky types (clear, clear turbid, intermediate, and overcast sky) and two daylight reference points for each exterior window of a daylight zone. The file is CSV formatted – ready for spreadsheet viewing. The input for requesting the report is simple:

The following shows an excerpt the daylight factors for a window without shade:

This file contains daylight factors for all exterior windows of daylight zones.

If only one reference point the last 4 columns in the data will be zero.

Results of the window screen transmittance map. This file can be used to create a 3-D Column chart for graphically viewing the direct beam and reflected beam transmittance at various relative azimuth and relative altitude angles. The “relative” angles in this file are the incident solar angles with respect to the outward surface normal. The figures below are example 3-D charts generated using the data provided in this output file.

![TransmittancePlotExample](media/image022.jpg)



eplustbl.&lt;ext&gt;
----------------

The eplustbl file contains the tabular output results that are created when using the following objects:

- Output:Table:SummaryReports

- Output:Table:TimeBins

- Output:Table:Monthly

- UtilityCost:Tariff

- ComponentCost:Line Item

The format and the extension for the file depends on the setting of the ColumnSeparator field of the Output:Table:Style object. The choices of HTML, tab, fixed, comma, and XML result in eplustbl.htm, eplustbl.tab, eplustbl.txt, eplustbl.csv, eplustbl.xml respectively. The HTML version of the report also includes a table of contents that allows easier navigation through the file.

By default the energy units reported in all of the eplustbl files are in Joules (J) but the UnitConversion field of the Output:Table:Style object allows for the values to be reported in MJ, GJ or in kWh. In addition, the Output:Table:Style object can specify for the tables to be in IP units for all fields.

### Output:Table:SummaryReports

Several predefined reports are available from the Output:Table:SummaryReports object including the following. (spaces are inserted in names for readability; keys are included in the Input Data Dictionary or by just removing the spaces):

- All Summary

Lists all following applicable tables with “Summary” in the name.

- All Monthly

Lists all following applicable tables with “Monthly” in the name.

- All Summary And Monthly

Lists all following applicable tables with both “Summary” and “Monthly” in the name. This does not include the Zone Component Load Summary report.

- All Summary and Sizing Period

Lists the All Summary tables as well as the Zone Component Load report (currently the only Sizing Period report). Please note that the Zone Component Load report does increase the run time because it repeats sizing periods.

- All Summary Monthly and Sizing Period

Lists the All Summary tables, the Monthly tables as well as the Zone Component Load report (currently the only Sizing Period report). Please note that the Zone Component Load report does increase the run time because it repeats sizing periods.

### Annual Building Utility Performance Summary

The Annual Building Utility Performance Summary report provides an overview of energy consumption in the building for different end uses. The following is an example this report (some columns may be truncated due to page size). The key used to obtain this report is AnnualBuildingUtilityPerformanceSummary.

In the *Comfort and Setpoint Not Met Summary* sub-table, facility hours represents the total number of hours that any single zone did not meet the comfort or setpoint criteria. It is not weighted by number of zones or number of occupants.

The values in the *End Uses* sub-table are from report meters. To determine which components are attached to each end-use meter, consult the meter details output file (\*.mtd).

### Lighting Summary

The Lighting Summary report provides a description of the interior and exterior lighting systems being simulated. It also provides a summary of daylighting controls. The Interior Lighting table has three columns that are explained below:

Scheduled Hours/Week [hr] - In the schedule shown, this represents the average weekly sum of hourly values. It is based on a full year even if the simulation is only performed for part of the year. It is not affected by daylighting.

Hours/Week &gt; 1% [hr] – This represents the average hours per week that are above 1% of the design value.

Full Load Hours/Week [hr] – This is based on consumption and hours that the consumption occurred. It is dependent on the run period used. When simulating only a portion of the year, the value depends on which days of the year (the number of weekdays versus weekend days, for example) are simulated. It also indicates the impact of daylighting control. Directly following is an example of the report. The key used to obtain this report is LightingSummary.

### HVAC Sizing Summary

The HVAC Sizing Summary report provides information on the zone cooling and heating sizing and the peak load conditions as well as information about the system air flow sizing. The Design Load is the zone sensible load only and it does not include any system effects or ventilation loads. The user specified design load and airflow and the values calculated by the program are shown in the report along with the time of the peak load and the temperature and humidity ratio at the time of the peak during the sizing periods. This information is generated for both the Zone Sensible Cooling and Zone Sensible Heating tables. 

Also included is the System Design Air Flow Rates which includes the calculated cooling air flow rate, the user specified air flow rate for cooling, the calculated heating air flow rate, and the user specified air flow rate for heating.

*Note:* values listed as "calculated" are the unaltered result of the zone or system sizing calculations, using the design sizing period weather and schedules specified in the input. Values listed as "user specified" are either the calculated values modified by global or zone sizing factors or values specified with the *flow/zone* or *flow/system* design air flow method.

Directly following is an example of the report.

### System Summary

The System Summary report provides information about some of the primary components in the system including the economizer and demand controlled ventilation. In addition, this report describes when the zone conditions are not comfortable or when set points are not met.

In the *Time Not Comfortable Based on Simple ASHRAE 55-2004* and Time Setpoint Not Met sub-tables, The reported time represents the total number of hours that a given zone did not meet the comfort or setpoint criteria. For the Facility row, this is the total numbers of hours that one or more zones were out of range. The values are not weighted by number of zones or number of occupants.

Directly following is an example of the report. The key used to obtain this report is SystemSummary.

### Zone Component Loads Summary

The Zone Component Loads Summary provides an estimate of the heating and cooling peak loads for each zone broken down into various components. This report may help determine which components of the load have the largest impact for the heating and cooling peak design conditions. When specified, the Zone Component Loads Summary report is created for each zone that is conditioned. The Sensible-Delayed column of the summary is only an estimate based on a procedure described in the Engineering Reference documentation. An intermediate calculation in this procedure is the decay curves that are shown in the the EIO file when Output:Surfaces:List is set to show DecayCurvesFromZoneComponentLoads. The difference between the peak design sensible load and the estimated instant + delayed sensible load (as shown in the *Peak Conditions* subtable) is an indication of how consistent the overall total estimate may be to the computed total peak loads for the zone. When the report is called the zone sizing calculations are repeated twice so this may result in longer simulation times.  The key used to obtain this report is ZoneComponentLoadSummary.

### Output:Table:TimeBins

A TimeBins report shows a grid of the number of hours that specific report variable spend in a range of values. The first table is broken into two parts. The first part is monthly and the second part is for each hour of the day. The columns show the range of values. A second table is provided to show some statistics on the report variable for the entire year including the maximum and minimum. These statistics are helpful in setting the field values for the interval in the Output Table:TimeBins object. Due to this, it is often necessary to run two simulations to fully utilize the TimeBins report with the first run used to find the minimum and maximum of the variable, these values are then used in the TimeBins object and the second run a better table of binned results are displayed.

### Output:Table:Monthly

Monthly reports are not predefined. Instead each column is defined when using the Output:Table:Monthly object. In that object each column is defined by a variable and how it should be aggregated. The StandardReports.idf file is located in DataSets directory where EnergyPlus is installed and contains a large number of examples of how to use Output:Table:Monthly to get summaries of the performance of different components in the building model. These examples include:

### UtilityCost:Tariff

The use of UtilityCost:Tariff objects automatically generates two reports related to the calculation of annual utility costs. The first report is a summary across multiple tariffs and is called the Economics Results Summary report and is shown directly below. After that example is an example of the Tariff report which is created for each of the UtilityCost:Tariff Objects defined in the IDF file  (some columns may be truncated due to page size).

This is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file that shows a diagram of the HVAC system from the inputs of the simulation. The diagram is generated for most HVAC systems but a few valid HVAC configurations cannot be displayed correctly. The SVG file is generated by the HVAC Diagram utility that is included with EnergyPlus and is run automatically when using EP-Launch.

The SVG format is a graphics format that includes a descriptions of lines, boxes, text, etc. set in a two dimensional perspective. To learn more about the SVG format see:

http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/

Several viewers are available so that you can view these files including plug-ins for Internet Explorer by Adobe and Corel. The Adobe SVG plug in can be found at:

http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/

But many different viewers are available and links are shown at:

http://www.svgi.org/

An example of a diagram generated by HVAC Diagram is shown



![](media/image023.jpg)

A close up of one part of this diagram is shown below

![](media/image024.jpg)

The SVG file format is an XML based format so it is text based. The diagram shown above is shown below in text (reduced).

eplusout.sci

This is the surface cost information report. This report file is obtained by including the following in the input file:

**Output:Surfaces:List, CostInfo;**

The intent is to make available a separate file that lists the unique surfaces and their construction types for potential use in external calculations that need to estimate the cost of construction. Note that such cost estimating can now also be performed internal to EnergyPlus using Cost Estimate objects. The listing can also be used to check that the input for surfaces is producing the expected areas (although the DXF is probably more useful for such checking).

The output file contains a list of the unique surfaces and their net and gross areas. The area information is calculated by EnergyPlus from the vertices entered for individual surfaces. The net area is the area remaining after the areas of subsurfaces are subtracted. The file contains six columns of comma-separate-data as shown in the following table:



<table class="table table-striped">
<tr>
<th>Column</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Integer counter for surfaces. The surfaces are listed in the order that they are stored internally in EnergyPlus. Note that in this report, the algorithms sort out and exclude duplicate surfaces that are entered for the interior partitions between adjacent thermal zones. Therefore the list is usually not consecutive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>The name of the surface entered by the user</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>The name of the construction for the surface entered by the user</td>

eplusout.wrl
------------

The VRML output report file is formatted according to the “Virtual Reality Modeling Language” standard rules for representing building type surfaces. The file can be used in several inexpensive, shareware or freeware viewers. There are a variety of stand alone and viewers integrated within browsers. A good list of viewers can be found at:

http://cic.nist.gov/vrml/vbdetect.html

This site detects what, if any, VRML plugin is installed in your browser as well as gives a list of active ones with links to their sites.

This file is generated when the following line is included in the IDF.

**Output:Surfaces:Drawing, VRML;**

In addition, like the DXF output, you can ask it to triangulate (algorithm within EnergyPlus) surfaces with &gt;4 sides:

**Output:Surfaces:Drawing, VRML, Triangulate 3dface;**

Most viewers will illustrate a solid model by default:

![5zone](media/image025.jpg)

Figure 10. VRML output - solid model

With some/many viewers, you can also see a wireframe model; some will even fill this model. Also, viewers can triangulate any surface that isn’t labeled as “convex” by the software writing the file (i.e. EnergyPlus). However, this triangulation may not be correct so you may wish to do it from within EnergyPlus as illustrated above.

A wireframe model of the same building as above is:

![5zonewire](media/image026.jpg)

Figure 11. VRML output - wireframe model

The actual file produced is a text file. EnergyPlus adds some comments, such as the list of zone names and surface names before each coordinate specification. The line/solid colors are set as Floor, Wall, etc. so the file is somewhat readable.

Delight output files
--------------------

### eplusout.delightin

Following completion of an EnergyPlus run that includes Daylighting:DElight objects, an ASCII text file created during the run is given a file name that consists of the project name appended with DElight.in (e.g., MyProjectDElight.in).

This text file is a formatted DElight input file that was created from the EnergyPlus input data relevant to a DElight simulation. This file can be manually reviewed to determine the exact data that were transformed from EnergyPlus into DElight input.

### eplusout.delightout

Following completion of an EnergyPlus run that includes Daylighting:DElight objects, an ASCII text file created during the run is given a file name that consists of the project name appended with DElight.out (e.g., MyProjectDElight.out).

This text file is a formatted DElight output file that was generated by the DElight simulation engine following the pre-processing daylight factors calculation. This file can be manually reviewed to see the results of these calculations. The file contains an echo of DElight input data, as well as the results of intermediate calculations such as geometrical transformations, surface gridding, and daylight factors, including the following.

**Surface Data**

- Vertex coordinates in the Building coordinate system. Search for the string “BldgSystem\_Surface\_Vertices” within the output file.

- Exterior face luminance values under overcast skies, and for each sun position under clear skies. Search for the string “Surface Exterior Luminance” within the output file.

- Common data for radiosity nodal patches for each surface including Area and Number of Nodes. Search for the string “Surface\_Node\_Area” within the output file.

- Individual data for radiosity nodal patches for each node on each surface including: building coordinate system coordinates; direct and total luminance values under overcast skies, and for each sun position under clear skies. Search for the string “BldgSystem\_Node\_Coordinates” within the output file.

**Reference Point Data**

- Illuminance values from the daylighting factors preprocessor for overcast skies, and for each sun position under clear skies.

- Daylight Factor values from the daylighting factors preprocessor for overcast skies, and for each sun position under clear skies.

- NOTE: The Monthly Average data for Daylight Illuminances and Electric Lighting Reduction will all be zero since these data are not calculated as part of the pre-processing done by the point at which this output file is generated for EnergyPlus.

Example Input Files
===================

The EnergyPlus install includes a sample of example input files. For the most part, the developers create these files to illustrate and test a specific feature in EnergyPlus. Then, we pass them along to you for illustrative purposes. The install contains two spreadsheet files related to the example files:

- **ExampleFiles.xls** - lists all the files available – whether through the install or through an external site.

- **ExampleFiles-ObjectLink.xls** - illustrates the first 3 occurances in the example files of an object.

Following convention, each example file should have at the top a set of comments that tell what the purpose of the file is and the key features.

For example, the file titled “5ZoneAirCooled.idf” has:

```idf

In addition to the idf files, usually an .rvi and perhaps a .mvi of the same file set is included. As discussed previously, the .rvi is used with the ReadVarsESO post-processing program and the .eso file to create a .csv file which can be read easily into Excel™. Like the .rvi, the .mvi file can be used with the .mtr file to create a similar version for “metered” outputs.

Data Sets
=========

Data sets are the EnergyPlus answer to “libraries”. Data sets come in two flavors – a simple list and a “macroized” list. Macroized lists are files that could have the elements extracted using a simple macro name.

Simple List Data Sets
---------------------

### AirCooledChillers.idf

This dataset includes performance curves for air cooled electric EIR chiller (object type: Chiller:Electric:EIR). Knowing the type of chiller that you want to simulate, you can find it and the associated performance curves in the dataset file. A brief synopsis of AirCooledChiller.idf is shown below:

```idf

### ASHRAE\_2005\_HOF\_Materials.idf

This reference data set contains content from two chapters in the ASHRAE 2005 Handbook of Fundamentals, Chapter 30 - the Cooling and Heating Loads calculations chapter has both materials with thermal properties and constructions for Light, Medium, and Heavy buildings. Chapter 25 contains details thermal properties of many materials -- no constructions are created from that data.

The following materials and constructions are created from ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, 2005, Chapter 30, Table 19 and Table 22. These are representative of materials and constructions used in Cooling and Heating Load Calculations.

### Boilers.idf

This dataset includes performance curves for non-electric boilers. Reference: Condensing Technology, Technical Series, Viessmann, 9446 803 - 1 GB Nov. 2004.

### California\_Title\_24-2008.idf

This dataset includes occupancy data and non-residential schedules for California Title 24-2008 compliance calculations when lighting plans are submitted for the Entire Building or when lighting compliance is not performed. Data is based on Table N2-5 of the 2008 Non-residential ACM Manual.

### Chillers.idf

This dataset includes object types for specific (by manufacturer and type) Chiller:Electric:EIR and Chiller: Electric:ReformulatedEIR and associated performance curves.

Knowing the type of chiller that you want to simulate, you can find it and the associated performance curves in the dataset file. By example, here is part of the comments in the Chiller.idf file:

### CompositeWallConstructions.idf

The Reference Data Set CompositeWallConstructions.idf contains constructions and associated materials for a set of **composite** walls. These are walls—such as stud walls—that have complicated heat-flow paths so that the conduction is two- or three-dimensional.

An example entry in this data set--for an insulated 2”x4” steel-stud wall--looks like:

```idf
CONSTRUCTION,Composite 2x4 Steel Stud R11,
! ASHRAE 1145-RP Wall Assembly 10
! 2"x4" steel studs at 24" on center with between-stud R11 fibreglass insulation.
! Studs are 3.5", 16 gauge, 15 flange.
! Layers are 1/2" wood siding, 1/2" plywood, 2x4 steel studs and R11 insulation, 1/2" gypsum board.
! Area-average R-Value = 8.796 ft2-F-h/Btu (1.548 m2-K/W).
! Total wall thickness = 5.00in (0.127m)

The materials here are **not** real materials but are “equivalent” materials obtained from finite-difference modeling. The thickness, conductivity, density and specific heat values of the material layers for the different constructions have been taken from the ASHRAE report “Modeling Two- and Three-Dimensional Heat Transfer through Composite Wall and Roof Assemblies in Hourly Energy Simulation Programs (1145-TRP),” by Enermodal Engineering Limited, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Polish Academy of Sciences, January 2001. EnergyPlus will calculate conduction transfer functions using these materials. The heat transfer based on these conduction transfer functions will then be very close to what would be calculated with a two- or three-dimensional heat transfer calculation.

For stud walls, using these composite constructions will give more accurate heat flow than you would get by manually dividing the wall into a stud section and a non-stud section.

If your wall’s exterior or interior roughness or thermal, solar or visible absorptances are different from those in the data set, you can make the appropriate changes to the first material (the outside layer) or the third material (the inside layer). **None of the other values should be changed.**

### ElectronicEnthalpyEconomizerCurves.idf

These curves approximate the electronic (variable) enthalpy curves used to simulate humidity biased economizer control. This control scheme adjusts the upper outdoor air humidity ratio based on outdoor air dry-bulb temperature as shown in the figure below. California Title 24 ACM 2005 lists the optional economizer control strategies. One of these control strategies is referred to as variable enthalpy control curve A. This control strategy is also cited in ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004, using the term “electronic enthalpy”. Electronic enthalpy curves A-D are included in this dataset.

![Schematic\_ElectronicEnthalpyEconomizerControl](media/image027.jpg)

Figure 12. Psychrometric Chart Illustration of the Electronic (Variable) Enthalpy Economizer Limit Example Curve Objects

For the curves provided, curve A has the highest limit and curve D has the lowest limit. These curve objects represent a single-point electronic enthalpy control curve with the curve object’s minimum value of x (temperature) crossing the psychrometric chart's saturation line and the curve object’s maximum value of x crossing the psychrometric chart's dry-bulb temperature axis. The curve object’s minimum (maximum) value of x should be just low (high) enough to ensure that the curve crosses the psychrometric chart’s saturation line (temperature axis). The curves are evaluated at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature to provide a maximum operating outdoor humidity ratio for economizer operation. If the outdoor humidity ratio is greater than this maximum value, economizer operation is terminated. These curves may be used with other economizer limits to create multi-point economizer control (Temperature Limit, Temperature Low Limit, Enthalpy Limit, and Dewpoint Temperature Limit).

#### Form of the Electronic Enthalpy Curve Equation:

The electronic enthalpy curve equation represents a unique curve and is a function of both temperature and relative humidity. The equation is set equal to a constant which provides a unique temperature for each relative humidity entered into the equation. Each control curve has a unique constant as shown in the table below. Other constants may be used to develop specialized electronic enthalpy curves.

<div>\[ K = 45.672192 - 1.1559942 \cdot T - 0.144599 \cdot RH \]</div>

where:

* K  = Constant value to represent specific curve
* T  = Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature (C)
* RH = Outdoor Relative Humidity (%)


NOTE:  modifying the RH multiplier (-0.144599) tends to "wag" the curvature at the upper relative humidities. Decreasing the multiplier "wags" the upper portion of the curve downward, increasing "wags" it upwards. Modifying the constant (K) moves the intersection of the curve with the Dry-Bulb Temperature  axis. Increasing the constant moves the intersection to the left as shown in the figure, decreasing moves to the right. The minimum and/or maximum x boundaries in the curve objects may have to be adjusted when modifying the equation.

#### Example Curve A:

The method described here was used to create each of the four "cubic" curve objects provided in the electronic enthalpy economizer control data set.

**Step 1:** Substitute the curve constant K for curve A (12) into the electronic enthalpy curve equation and solve for temperature. Then identify the outdoor air dry-bulb temperatures at known values of relative humidity (e.g., columns 1 and 2 in the table below). Psychrometric routines are helpful for this step.

<div>\[ \text{Temperature} = \frac{12 - 45.672192 + 0.144599 \cdot \text{RelativeHumidity}}{-1.1559942} \]</div>

**Step 2:** Identify humidity ratio at each point (e.g. column 3 in the following table). Psychrometric routines are helpful for this step.

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr>
<th>Relative Humidity (%)</th>
<th>Temperature (ºC)</th>
<th>Calculated Humidity Ratio (kg/kg)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>29.128</td>
<td>0.00000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>27.877</td>
<td>0.00232</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>26.627</td>
<td>0.00433</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>30</td>
<td>25.376</td>
<td>0.00605</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40</td>
<td>24.125</td>
<td>0.00750</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>50</td>
<td>22.874</td>
<td>0.00872</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>60</td>
<td>21.623</td>
<td>0.00971</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>70</td>
<td>20.372</td>
<td>0.01051</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>80</td>
<td>19.121</td>
<td>0.01112</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>90</td>
<td>17.871</td>
<td>0.01158</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>16.620</td>
<td>0.01189</td>
</tr>
</table>

** **

**Step 3:** Use multiple linear regression to solve one of the following equations:

*Quadratic  Curve*: Humidity Ratio = A0 + A1\*Temperature + A2\*Temperature<sup>2</sup>

*Cubic  Curve*: Humidity Ratio = A0 + A1\*Temperature + A2\*Temperature<sup>2</sup> + A3\*Temperature<sup>3</sup>

**Step 4:** Use the coefficients calculated in the multiple linear regression to create a cubic (or quadratic) curve object.

### GHLERefData.idf

This file contains sample input for the ground loop heat exchanger model. The response of the borehole/ground is found from the 'G-function' that is  defined in the input as series of 'n' pairs of values (LNTTSn, GNFCn). It is important to note that the G-functions have to be calculated for specific GHE configurations and borehole resitance, length and borehole/ length ratio. That is, the parameters for the units vary with each design. The data in this file are intended as examples/samples and may not represent actual designs.

The sample data has been calculated for a number of configurations:

* 1 x 2 boreholes
* 4 x 4 boreholes
* 8 x 8 boreholes

Data is given for both 'standard' grout (k=0.744 W/m.K) and 'thermally enhanced' grout (k= 1.471 W/m.K). The flow rate per borehole is .1514 kg/s. The pipe given is 0.75in. Dia. SDR11 HDPE. The fluid is water. The borehole/length ratio is 0.06  (76.2m/4.572m [300ft/15ft])

Macro Data Sets
---------------

### Locations-DesignDays.xls

Strictly speaking, the locations-designdays.xls file is not a macro enabled input file. Rather, it is the “pointer” to other files and can be searched by city name, country, etc. All the Design Conditions from the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (2005) have been encoded into Design Day definitions and are stored on the EnergyPlus web site by WMO Region (similarly to how the weather data is stored). The spreadsheet contains a “readme” page as well as cities, countries, and links to the proper web pages.

### SandiaPVData.idf

Use these PV statements for implementing PV modules in an EnergyPlus input file when using the Sandia model.

### SolarCollectors.idf

Use these SOLAR COLLECTOR PARAMETERS objects for implementing solar collector modules in an EnergyPlus input file.

Data has been reproduced with permission from: "Directory of SRCC Certified Solar Collector Ratings" Copyright (c) 2004 by the Solar Rating and Certification Corporation.

### UtilityTariffObjects.imf

Use the large collections of input objects to model the costs of energy supplied by utility companies. This file is ready for use in macro processing but the input objects can readily be copied out of the macro file and used in a regular input file. The data were assembled by NREL researcher Brent Griffith and represent a best effort at putting together a comprehensive set of utility tariffs for commercial buildings for the USA as of Spring 2005. Use the data at your own risk and note that utility tariffs need to be continually updated to reflect current conditions.
