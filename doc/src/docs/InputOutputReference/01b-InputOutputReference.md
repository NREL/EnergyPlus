### ZoneBaseboard:OutdoorTemperatureControlled

This object specifies outside temperature-controlled (OTC) baseboard heating. The capacities (high and low) are specified in W at the temperatures specified. The schedule allows both capacities to change hourly on a proportional basis. This baseboard heater does not operate if the outdoor dry-bulb is above the high temperature limit. Between the high temperature and the low temperature, the capacity is interpolated (linear) between the high and the low capacity values. Below the low temperature, the capacity is set at the low capacity value. This allows the user to add baseboard heat to a perimeter zone starting at a prescribed temperature and then slowly increases this capacity to a max value.

**Example:**

Temperature High = 10 C     Capacity High = 100,000 W

Temperature Low = 0 C        Capacity Low  = 500,000 W

#### Field: Name

The name of the ZoneBaseboard:OutdoorTemperatureControlled object.

#### Field: Zone Name

This field is the name of the zone and attaches the baseboard heat equipment statement to a thermal zone in the building.

#### Field: Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule that modifies the capacities (high and low) for baseboard heat equipment (see next four fields). The schedule values can be any positive number. The actual energy input for the baseboard equipment in a zone as defined by this statement depends on the actual outdoor temperature and where that temperature is in the range of Low Temperature to High Temperature..

#### Field: Capacity at Low Temperature

This is the baseboard equipment capacity (Watts) at the low temperature limit. This is the maximum capacity of the baseboard equipment in full load operation. This field is autosizable.

#### Field: Low Temperature

If the outdoor dry-bulb temperature (degrees Celsius) is at or below the low temperature the baseboard heater operates at the low temperature capacity. This field is autosizable. The lowest design outdoor dry bulb temperature is chosen, if autosized.

#### Field: Capacity at High Temperature

This is the baseboard equipment capacity (Watts) at the high temperature limit. This field is autosizable. The capacity at low temperature is prorated against the reference low and high temperature fields, if autosized.

#### Field: High Temperature

If the outdoor dry-bulb temperature (degrees Celsius) is greater than the high temperature the baseboard heater will not operate. This field is autosizable. If autosized, this is equal to the design zone heating setpoint temperature described below, so that the capacity at high temperature is zero.

#### Field: Fraction Radiant

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the type of heat being given off by baseboard heat equipment in a zone.  The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by the baseboard heat equipment to give the amount of long wavelength radiation gain to the zone.

#### Field: End-Use Subcategory

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., "Perimeter Baseboards", etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory  (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table. If this field is omitted or blank, the baseboard equipment will be assigned to the "General" end-use subcategory.

#### Field: Design Zone Heating Setpoint

This is heating setpoint temperature in the zone where the unit serves. This is used to autosize high temperature and capacity at high temperature fields. The default value is 20°C.

Group – Daylighting
-------------------

Daylighting can be invoked in EnergyPlus by the use of two objects: **Daylighting:Controls** and **Daylighting:DELight:Controls**. These are described in the following object descriptions.

Note that Daylighting:Controls and Daylighting:DELight:Controls objects may be intermixed in a single IDF but may not be used in the same zone.

### Daylighting:Controls

In this method daylighting illuminance levels are calculated and then used to determine how much the electric lighting can be reduced. The daylight illuminance level in a zone depends on many factors, including sky condition; sun position; calculation point; location, size, and glass transmittance of windows; window shading devices; and reflectance of interior surfaces. Reduction of electric lighting depends on daylight illuminance level, illuminance set point, fraction of zone controlled and type of lighting control.

#### Field: Zone name

The name of the zone to which the following daylighting-related input applies.

#### Field: Total Daylighting Reference Points

Allowed values are 1 or 2. This the number of reference points in the zone at which horizontal daylighting illuminance will be calculated based on input for the following fields. It is assumed that the photocells that control the overhead electric lighting respond to the light levels at the specified reference points.

#### Fields: (X,Y,Z) of First Reference Point

Required if Total Daylighting Reference Points = 1 or 2. These three fields are the X, Y and Z values of the First Reference point in the coordinate system you specified for daylighting reference points in the GlobalGeometryRules object. Figure 53 shows an example using the relative coordinate (to zone) system. Z is typically at desk height (0.8 m).

If you want to divide a thermal zone into two independently-controlled lighting zones, then Total Daylighting Reference Points should be set to 2 and (X,Y,Z) of the Second Reference Point (see following input fields) should also be specified.

#### Fields: (X,Y,Z) of Second Reference Point

The X, Y, and Z coordinates, in the same coordinate system, of the second daylighting reference point. Required if Total Daylighting Reference Points = 2. See Figure 53 for an example.



![](media/image095.svg)

Figure 53. Example showing location of daylighting reference points in the zone coordinate system (relative) of a rectangular zone with three windows. (a) Perspective view, (b) plan view, (c) elevation view. All dimensions are in meters.

#### Field: Fraction of Zone Controlled by First Reference Point

The fraction of the zone’s floor-area whose electric lighting is controlled by the daylight illuminance at the First Reference Point. If there is only one reference point then a fraction equal to

1.0 - (Fraction of Zone Controlled by First Reference Point)

 is assumed to have no lighting control.

#### Field: Fraction of Zone Controlled by Second Reference Point

The fraction of the zone’s floor-area whose electric lighting is controlled by the daylight illuminance at the Second Reference Point. Required if Total Daylighting Reference Points = 2. A fraction equal to

1.0 – ([Fraction of Zone Controlled by First Reference Point] + [Fraction of Zone Controlled by Second Reference Point])

is assumed to have no lighting control.

#### Field: Illuminance SetPoint at First Reference Point

The desired lighting level (in lux) at the First Reference Point. This is the lighting level that would be produced at this reference point at night if the overhead electric lighting were operating at full input power. Recommended values depend on type of activity; they may be found, for example, in the Lighting Handbook of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. A typical value for general office work (excluding computer terminals) is 500 lux.

#### Field: Illuminance SetPoint at Second Reference Point

The desired lighting level (in lux) at the Second Reference Point. Required if Total Daylighting Reference Points = 2. This is the lighting level that would be produced at this reference point at night if the overhead electric lighting were operating at full input power.

#### Field: Lighting Control Type

The type of overhead electric lighting control. All reference points specified are assumed to have this type of control.

For Lighting Control Type = 1 (continuous), the overhead lights dim continuously and linearly from (maximum electric power, maximum light output) to (minimum electric power, minimum light output) as the daylight illuminance increases. The lights stay on at the minimum point with further increase in the daylight illuminance.

For Lighting Control Type = 2 (stepped), the electric power input and light output vary in discrete, equally spaced steps. The number of steps is given by Number of Steps (Excluding Off) of Stepped Control. For example, if Number of Steps = 3 and Illuminance Setpoint = 600, then the following table shows the fraction of the lights that are on vs. daylight illuminance.

Table 18. Stepped Lighting Control Example

</table>

Lighting Control Type = 3 (continuous/off) is the same as Lighting Control Type = 1 except that the lights switch off completely when the minimum dimming point is reached.

#### Field: Glare Calculation Azimuth Angle of View Direction Clockwise from Zone y-Axis

Daylight glare from a window depends on occupant view direction. It is highest when you look directly at a window and decreases as you look away from a window. This field specifies the view direction for calculating glare. It is the angle, measured clockwise in the horizontal plane, between the zone y-axis and the occupant view direction.

#### Field: Maximum Allowable Discomfort Glare Index

If a daylit zone has windows with shading devices (except exterior screens), the shades will be deployed if the daylight glare at the First Reference Point exceeds the value of this field. To get this type of glare control you have to specify Trigger = Glare, GlareOrSolarOnWindow, GlareOrHorizontalSolar, GlareOrOutsideAirTemp, GlareOrZoneAirTemp or GlareOrZoneLoad in WindowProperty:ShadingControl for one or more windows in the zone (see WindowProperty:ShadingControl).

If a zone has two or more windows with glare control, the shading devices will be deployed one by one in the order in which the windows are input until the glare level at each reference point falls below Maximum Allowable Discomfort Glare Index or is as close as possible to it.

The following table gives recommended values of Maximum Allowable Discomfort Glare Index.

#### Field: Minimum Input Power Fraction for Continuous Dimming Control

For Lighting Control Type = 1 (continuous), the lowest power the lighting system can dim down to, expressed as a fraction of maximum input power (see figure, below). For Lighting Control Type = 3 (continuous/off) this is the power fraction reached just before the lights switch off completely.

![](media/image096.svg)

Figure 54. Illustration of continuous dimming relationship

The figure above shows the relationship between electric light output and electrical input.

#### Field: Minimum Light Output Fraction for Continuous Dimming Control

For Lighting Control Type = 1 (continuous), the lowest lighting output the lighting system can dim down to, expressed as a fraction of maximum light output (see figure, above). This is the fractional light output that the system produces at minimum input power. For Lighting Control Type = 3 (continuous/off) this is the light output fraction reached just before the lights switch off completely.

#### Field: Number of Stepped Control Steps

The number of steps, excluding off, in a stepped lighting control system (see figure, below). Required and must be &gt;0 if Lighting Control Type = 2. The steps are assumed to be equally spaced.

![](media/image097.svg)

Figure 55. Stepped lighting control with Number of Steps = 3.

#### Field: Probability Lighting will be Reset When Needed in Manual Stepped Control

May be specified if a stepped lighting control system (Lighting Control Type = 2) is manually operated, such as in a simple, one-step (on-off) system. Gives the probability the occupants of a daylit zone will set the electric lights to the correct level to obtain the required illuminance. The rest of the time the lights are assumed to be set one step too high. For example, consider an on-off lighting system (Number of Steps = 1) with a set point of 600 lux and 0.7 reset probability. Then, when daylighting exceeds 600 lux, the electric lights will be off 70% of the time and on 30% of the time.

#### Field: Availability Schedule Name

This alpha field is optional and may be used to define the name of a schedule that denotes whether or not the control is available to operate during a given time period. If the schedule value is greater than zero, then the controls will be available to operate for that time period.  If the schedule value is zero or less, then the controls will not be available. If this field is left blank, the controls will be always available. For example, this can be useful for scheduling the daylighting controls off during design days so that the daylighting controls do not affect lighting power during sizing.

An IDF example:

```


### Guidelines for Daylighting Modeling (Detailed Method)

Following are some guidelines for preparing EnergyPlus input to model the effects of daylighting. Before studying these guidelines, however, you should read the description of each input field under Daylighting:Controls, and review the IDF example, above, and the sample daylighting input, PurchAirWithDaylighting.idf.

#### Use of Window Multipliers

If an exterior wall in a daylit zone has a number of identical windows, the windows should be entered separately rather than using a window multiplier (ref: FenestrationSurface:Detailed). Using a multiplier would give an incorrect illuminance calculation since individual windows would not be positioned correctly on the wall.

#### Use of Zone Multipliers

A zone multiplier should not be used on a daylit zone if the windows in the zone are shadowed by exterior obstructions like trees or neighboring buildings, or by obstructions caused by other parts of building. The reason for this is that the shadowing on the windows of the multiplied zone may be different from zone to zone depending on exactly how the shadows fall on the zones. However, a zone multiplier may be used on a daylit zone if the shadowing is by overhangs, fins and/or window setback.

#### Thermal Zoning for Daylighting

To correctly calculate both direct and inter-reflected daylight illuminance you should try to model a thermal zone consisting of several similar rooms separated by interior walls as a representative room with a zone multiplier (ref: Zone). An example of this is shown in Figure 56. Room-1 is the representative room, with a zone multiplier = 4.

Interior walls IW-1, IW-2 and IW-3 should be treated as adiabatic, i.e., they should have Outside Boundary Condition = Surface and Outside Boundary Condition Object = IW-1, IW-2, or IW-3, respectively (ref: BuildingSurface:Detailed). Similarly, if the ceiling and floor of Room-1 are interior surfaces, they should be treated as adiabatic.

![](media/image098.svg)

Figure 56. For daylighting purposes the thermal zone enclosed by the dashed boundary line should be modeled as a typical zone (Room-1) with a zone multiplier of 4.

Sometimes a representative room cannot be found. Figure 57 shows a section of a building with four rooms having different daylighting characteristics because of different floor area, orientation and/or window size. In this case lumping the rooms into a single thermal zone would give nonsensical daylighting illuminance values because of the presence of the interior walls, which EnergyPlus ignores when calculating illuminance reaching a reference point directly from a window (i.e., without reflection). The solution in this case is to describe each room as a separate thermal zone with its own daylighting reference points, and input the interior walls because these will participate in the calculation of inter-reflected illuminance.

![](media/image099.svg)

Figure 57. Rooms A, B, C and D have different daylighting characteristics. If lumped into a single thermal zone the daylighting calculation will be less accurate because the blockage of direct light by the interior walls between these rooms is modeled with some simplifications (see Interior Obstructions below). To get a good daylighting calculation each room should be input as a separate thermal zone.

#### Multiple Lighting Zones

The detailed daylighting calculation allows a thermal zone to be divided into two independently-controlled lighting zones. (See the fields: Fraction of Zone Controlled by First Reference Point, Fraction of Zone Controlled by Second Reference Point, Illuminance SetPoint at First Reference Point, and Illuminance SetPoint at Second Reference Point.) An example is shown in Figure 58, where a relatively deep thermal zone has two lighting zones of equal area.

![](media/image100.svg)

Figure 58. Two independently-controlled lighting zones, each with 50% of the area of the thermal zone.

#### Fins, Overhangs and Other Exterior Obstructions

The daylighting calculation accounts for the presence of exterior obstructions in determining the amount of light that strikes the windows. For daylighting purposes exterior obstructions fall into three categories:

(1)  Fins, overhangs, trees, neighboring buildings, etc., entered with the objects Shading:Zone:Detailed,
 Shading:Site:Detailed, or
 Shading:Building:Detailed.

(2)  Building surfaces like walls and roofs (in an L-shaped building, for example).

(3)  Surfaces associated with window setback.

Category (1) obstructions can have an associated solar transmittance schedule (see description of the field Transmittance Schedule Name for these shading surfaces). If this schedule is not specified, the surface is opaque (has zero transmittance).

The daylighting calculation takes the transmittance into account in determining, for example, how much light enters a window through a translucent awning. It is assumed that the solar and visible transmittance is the same and that the surfaces are non-diffusing, i.e., they do not change the direction of transmitted light. Ref:Daylighting:Controls.

Category (2) and (3) surfaces are assumed to be opaque.

Surfaces in all three categories are assumed to be black, i.e., they do not reflect light, unless you set if “Reflections” option is chosen  in the Building object. Then obstructions can reflect light, such as the top of an overhang reflecting light onto the window above. Ref: Building, Field: Solar Distribution (with reflections options).

#### Interior Obstructions

The daylighting calculation accounts for the presence of interior obstructions that lie between a window and a reference point. Unlike exterior obstructions, which can be light transmitting, interior obstructions are assumed to be opaque. Interior obstructions can reduce or eliminate the light directly reaching the reference point through a window.

However, interior obstructions that are walls, ceilings or floors are reflecting so they  contribute to the inter-reflected component of daylight illuminance as do the non-obstructing zone surfaces.

Interior obstructions can belong to the Shading object series. This type of obstruction is assumed to be non-reflecting so does not contribute to the inter-reflected component of daylight illuminance.

An example of an interior obstruction that is a wall in an L-shaped room is shown in Figure 59. Here, wall A (or, equivalently, Wall B) prevents light from directly getting to the Reference Point from the window.



![](media/image101.svg)

Figure 59. Wall A (or Wall B) is an interior obstruction that prevents light from directly reaching the daylighting reference point from the window.

#### Double Façades: Daylighting through Interior Windows

The Daylighting:Controls method, with no additional user input,  calculates the contribution of daylight that passes into a target zone through interior windows.[[1]](#_ftn1) The origin of this daylight is exterior windows in adjacent zones that share interior windows with the target zone. This capability is aimed at daylighting through a **double façade** (also called “double envelope” or “double skin.”)

This is illustrated in Figure 60, which shows a double-façade buffer zone, Z0, with exterior windows EW1 and EW2. Z0 shares interior windows IW1, IW2 and IW3 with daylit occupied zones ZD1, ZD2 and ZD3, respectively (“daylit” here means the zone has an associated Daylighting:Controls object). The daylight illuminance at reference points RP1, RP2 and RP3 comes from the interior windows and has two main sources:

1.    Daylight that passes through both an exterior window and an interior window in Z0 and reaches a reference point without reflection. This is called “direct illuminance.”

2.    Daylight from Z0  that passes through an interior window and reaches a reference point by inter-reflection in the daylit zone. Because the program calculates this source from the interior solar distribution in Z0 it is recommended that the most accurate calculation of this distribution be made, which occurs if Solar Distribution = FullInteriorAndExterior in the Building object.

A third possible source is neglected because it is generally small in double-façade cases. This is daylight that is reflected from the surfaces of Z0, passes through an interior window and then reaches a reference point without inter-reflection in the daylit zone.

PurchAirWithDoubleFacadeDaylighting.idf is an input example of daylighting through an interior window.



![](media/image102.svg)

Figure 60. Vertical section through a double-façade building showing daylighting through interior windows. The dashed lines show that (1) reference point RP1 receives direct light from exterior window EW1 via interior window IW1; (2) RP2 receives direct light from EW1 and EW2 via IW2; and (3) RP3 receives direct light from EW2 via IW3.

#### Interior Window Daylighting Configurations that EnergyPlus Can Calculate

Figure 61 shows schematically the general configuration of daylighting through interior windows that can be calculated with EnergyPlus. Here, daylit zone ZD has one or more interior windows that are adjacent to other zones, each of which has one or more exterior windows. ZD itself may or may not have exterior windows. If it does, than the daylight illuminance from its exterior and interior windows will be additive. The zones adjacent to ZD may or may not be daylit and may or may not have other interior windows that are not adjacent to ZD. (The program does not consider the illuminance in ZD from electric lighting in adjacent zones.)

![](media/image103.svg)

Figure 61. General configuration of daylighting through interior windows that can be calculated with EnergyPlus. IW = interior window, EW = exterior window.

#### Interior Window Daylighting Configurations that EnergyPlus Cannot Calculate

Figure 62 shows schematically a configuration of daylighting through interior windows that cannot be calculated with EnergyPlus. Here, zone Z has an interior window that is adjacent to zone Z1 which in turn has an interior window adjacent to zone Z2. However, the daylight from the exterior window in Z2 that enters Z after passing through Z1 is not calculated because Z2 is not adjacent to Z.

#### Restrictions on Shading Devices

There are two restrictions on the use of exterior-window shading devices when a daylit zone has interior windows:

1)   If two daylit zones share an interior window, neither zone can have an exterior window whose shading device does glare control (i.e., the WindowProperty:ShadingControl for the exterior window has Glare Control Is Active = Yes).

2)   If two daylit zones share an interior window, neither zone can have an exterior window with a WindowProperty:ShadingControl that has Shading Control Type = MeetDaylightIlluminanceSetpoint.

### DElight Daylighting Method

The DElight method of analyzing daylighting in buildings is very similar to that used in the Detailed method. For each point in time, DElight calculates the interior daylighting illuminance at specified reference points and then determines how much the electric lighting can be reduced while still achieving a combined daylighting and electric lighting illuminance target. The daylight illuminance level in a zone depends on many factors, including exterior light sources; location, size, and visible light transmittance of simple and complex fenestration systems; reflectance of interior surfaces; and location of calculation reference points. The subsequent reduction of electric lighting depends on daylight illuminance level, illuminance set point, fraction of zone controlled, and type of lighting control.

There are two primary differences between the Detailed and DElight methods of calculating interior illuminance levels. The first is that DElight includes the capability of analyzing complex fenestration systems that include geometrically complicated shading systems (e.g., roof monitors) and/or optically complicated glazings (e.g., prismatic or holographic glass). The second key difference is that DElight uses a radiosity method to calculate the effects of light reflection inside a zone. These methods are discussed in more detail in the engineering documentation.

There are other important differences between the two methods. One is the inability of DElight to perform the type of dynamic shading controls possible using the Detailed method at each point in time during the thermal simulation (e.g., changes in electrochromic glazing transmittances and blind slat angles). Another is the DElight ability to include more than two reference points in its interior illuminance and electric lighting reduction calculations. A third is the current lack of visual quality (e.g., glare) calculations performed by DElight. Fourth, the modeling of interior obstructions is different in the two methods. In the DElight method interior obstructions block interreflections but do not block the intial direct illuminance. In the Detailed method, interior obstructions block the initial direct illuminance but do not block interreflections. See the engineering documentation for more details.

Input for invoking the DElight method involves three object types: **Daylighting:DELight:Controls**, **Daylighting:DELight:ReferencePoint**, and **Daylighting:DELight:ComplexFenestration**. Each of these objects is described below.

### Daylighting:DELight:Controls

The first input object required for invoking the DElight method is the Daylighting:DELight:Controls object, which defines the parameters of each daylighting zone within a building. This object must be associated with a specific thermal zone within the building for which the reduction in electric lighting due to daylight illuminance will be accounted.

#### Field: Name

User name of the DElight daylighting zone to which the following input applies.

#### Field: Zone Name

The name of the thermal Zone hosting this DElight daylighting zone. This must be a valid name that has been associated with a thermal Zone contained in the same EnergyPlus input data file.

#### Field: Lighting Control Type

The type of overhead electric lighting control. All reference points specified are assumed to have this type of control.

For Lighting Control Type = 1 (continuous), the overhead lights dim continuously and linearly from (maximum electric power, maximum light output) to (minimum electric power, minimum light output) as the daylight illuminance increases. The lights stay on at the minimum point with further increase in the daylight illuminance.

For Lighting Control Type = 2 (stepped), the electric power input and light output vary in discrete, equally spaced steps. The number of steps is given by Number of Steps (Excluding Off) of Stepped Control. For example, if Number of Steps = 3 and Illuminance Setpoint = 600, then the following table shows the fraction of the lights that are on vs. daylight illuminance.

Table 20. Stepped Lighting Control Example

<table class="table table-striped">
 <tr>
  <th colspan="2">Example of a Stepped Lighting Control System with Three Steps</th>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>400-600</td>
  <td>1/3</td>

  <td>600 and above</td>
  <td>0.0</td>
 </tr>
</table>

Lighting Control Type = 3 (continuous/off) is the same as Lighting Control Type = 1 except that the lights switch off completely when the minimum dimming point is reached.

#### Field: Minimum Input Power Fraction for Continuous Dimming Control

For Lighting Control Type = 1 (continuous), the lowest power the lighting system can dim down to, expressed as a fraction of maximum input power (see figure, below). For Lighting Control Type = 3 (continuous/off) this is the power fraction reached just before the lights switch off completely.

![](media/image105.svg)

Figure 63. Illustration of continuous dimming relationship

The figure above shows the relationship between electric light output and electrical input.

#### Field: Minimum Light Output Fraction for Continuous Dimming Control

For Lighting Control Type = 1 (continuous), the lowest lighting output the lighting system can dim down to, expressed as a fraction of maximum light output (see figure, above). This is the fractional light output that the system produces at minimum input power. For Lighting Control Type = 3 (continuous/off) this is the power fraction reached just before the lights switch off completely.

#### Field: Number of Steps (Excluding Off) for Stepped Control

The number of steps, excluding off, in a stepped lighting control system (see figure, below). Required and must be &gt;0 if Lighting Control Type = 2. The steps are assumed to be equally spaced.

![](media/image106.svg)

Figure 64. Stepped lighting control with Number of Steps = 3.

#### Field: Probability Lighting Will Be Reset When Needed in Manual Stepped Control

May be specified if a stepped lighting control system (Lighting Control Type = 2) is manually operated, such as in a simple, one-step (on-off) system. Gives the probability the occupants of a daylit zone will set the electric lights to the correct level to obtain the required illuminance. The rest of the time the lights are assumed to be set one step too high. For example, consider an on-off lighting system (Number of Steps = 1) with a set point of 600 lux and 0.7 reset probability. Then, when daylighting exceeds 600 lux, the electric lights will be off 70% of the time and on 30% of the time.

#### Field: Gridding Resolution

The maximum surface area for nodes in gridding (subdividing) all surfaces in the DElight zone. All reflective and transmitting surfaces will be subdivided into approximately square nodes that do not exceed this maximum. Higher resolution subdivisions require greater calculation times, but generally produce more accurate results. This same gridding resolution is also used to subdivide any Complex Fenestration System surfaces. It is advisable to perform at least one simulation of new input using a small gridding resolution such as 0.1m2 to compare these results against simulation runs at lower resolution (i.e., higher maximum area nodal grids) to get a sense of possible levels of error.

An IDF example:



```idf
Daylighting:DELight:Controls,
    DElight NORTH ZONE, !- DElight Zone Name
    NORTH ZONE,         !- Zone Name
    1,     !- Lighting control type
    0.3,   !- Minimum input power fraction for continuous dimming control
    0.2,   !- Minimum light output fraction for continuous dimming control
    0,     !- Number of steps (excluding off) for stepped control
    1.0,   !- Probability lighting will be reset when needed in manual stepped control
    1.0;   !- Gridding Resolution {m2}
```




### Daylighting:DELight:ReferencePoint

The second input object required for invoking the DElight method is the Daylighting:DELight:ReferencePoint object, which defines the parameters of each Reference Point within the associated DElight daylighting zone. This object must be associated with a specific Daylighting:DELight:Controls object instance. There may be up to a maximum of 100 Reference Points for each DElight daylighting zone. Each Reference Point that is input does NOT need to be included in the control of the electric lighting system within the zone. This is determined by the fraction of the zone controlled by each Reference Point, which can be input as 0. Note that the sum of all Reference Point control fractions must equal 1 to obtain correct overall results.

#### Field: Name

User name of the DElight daylighting Reference Point to which the following input applies.

#### Field: DElight Name

The name of the Daylighting:DELight:Controls object instance hosting this Reference Point. This must be a valid name that has been associated with a DElight daylighting Zone contained in the same EnergyPlus input data file.

#### Fields: (X,Y,Z) of Reference Point

These three fields are the X, Y and Z values of the Reference point in the coordinate system you specified for daylighting reference points in the GlobalGeometryRules object. Figure 65 shows an example using the relative coordinate (to zone) system. Z is typically at work surface height (e.g., 0.8m for a desk).



![](media/image107.svg)

Figure 65. Example showing location of two daylighting reference points in the zone coordinate system (relative) of a rectangular zone with three windows. (a) Perspective view, (b) plan view, (c) elevation view. All dimensions are in meters.

#### Field: Fraction of Zone Controlled by Reference Point

The zone floor-area fraction of the electric lighting that is controlled by the daylight illuminance at this Reference Point. If the sum of the values for this field for all Reference Points input for a given daylighting zone is less than 1.0, then the remaining fraction (i.e., 1.0 – Sum) is assumed to not have lighting control.

Note that Reference Points may be input with a 0.0 value for this fraction. In this case, daylight factors and interior illuminance values will be calculated for the Reference Point, but it will play no role in controlling the electric lighting within the daylighting zone to which it belongs.

#### Field: Illuminance Setpoint at Reference Point

The desired lighting level (in lux) at this Reference Point. This is assumed to be the lighting level that would be produced at this reference point at night if the overhead electric lighting were operating at full input power. Recommended values depend on the type of activity and may be found, for example, in the Lighting Handbook of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. A typical value for general office work (excluding computer terminals) is 500 lux.

An IDF example:

```idf
Daylighting:DELight:ReferencePoint,
    RefPt 2,            !- Reference Point Name
    DElight NORTH ZONE, !- DElight Zone Name
    5.0,  !- X-coordinate of reference point {m}
    3.0,  !- Y-coordinate of reference point {m}
    0.9,  !- Z-coordinate of reference point {m}
    0.5,  !- Fraction of zone controlled by reference point
    500.; !- Illuminance setpoint at reference point {lux}
```


### Daylighting:DELight:ComplexFenestration

The third input object related to the DElight method is the Daylighting:DElight: Complex Fenestration object. The DElight daylighting analysis method can be applied to daylighting zones that contain only simple fenestration systems such as windows and skylights that are standard EnergyPlus sub-surfaces. In this situation, no Daylighting:DElight: Complex Fenestration object would be input.

In addition to analyzing simple fenestration systems, DElight includes the capability of analyzing complex fenestration systems such as geometrically complicated static shading systems (e.g., roof monitors) and/or optically complicated glazings (e.g., prismatic or holographic glass). This capability is based on characterizing these complex fenestration systems (CFS) using bi-directional transmittance distribution functions (BTDF). In general, BTDF data for a specific CFS must be either measured or simulated (e.g., using ray-tracing techniques) prior to employing DElight to analyze it within EnergyPlus. The current implementation of DElight CFS calculations within EnergyPlus supports two approaches to the input of BTDF, an analytical approach and a file-based approach. The details of inputting these two approaches are described below under the User Complex Fenestration Type field.

Two analytical CFS BTDF types are currently supported, window and light shelf. The file-based approach requires that a user has access to a data file containing raw BTDF data that DElight reads as additional input during its analysis calculations. BTDF data files are described separately since it is anticipated that individual EnergyPlus users will not create these data files themselves.

The methods related to characterizing and analyzing CFS using BTDF are still evolving. DElight is an early implementation of CFS analysis methods. These methods, and the input associated with them here, will likely change in the future.

#### Field: User Name

User name of the DElight daylighting Complex Fenestration to which the following input applies.

#### Field: Complex Fenestration Type

Type name of the DElight daylighting Complex Fenestration system to be analyzed. This type name must take one of the following two forms.

BTDF^GEN^Analytical Type^Normal Visible Transmittance^Dispersion Angle

BTDF^FILE^Filename

The first form above is for supported analytical CFS types which currently include WINDOW and LIGHTSHELF. While these analytical types are relatively simple, they represent flexible ways to explore diffusing CFS systems and the impact of light shelves in redirecting light through an aperture. Each of these types also requires the visible transmittance of the CFS at normal incidence angle, and a dispersion angle (in degrees) that represents the “spread” of transmitted light. A small dispersion angle of 10 corresponds to clear glazing while a large angle of 90 corresponds to perfectly diffusing glazing. The “^” symbol must be used as a delimiter between sub-fields within this Complex Fenestration type name string as shown in the IDF example for WINDOW below, and in the DElight sample input data files.

The second form above is for CFS types for which there is pre-measured or pre-simulated BTDF data. In this case the Filename sub-field must be a valid data file name that is associated with an existing BTDF dataset that DElight can use in its calculations.

#### Field: Building Surface Name

The name of the heat transfer surface object instance hosting this Complex Fenestration, analogous to the Building Surface Name field for subsurfaces such as Windows. This must be a valid name that has been associated with a heat transfer surface contained in the same EnergyPlus input data file.

#### Field: Window Name

The name of the Window (ref: FenestrationSurface:Detailed object) instance that will be used to account for the geometry, and the solar/thermal gains/losses, of the Complex Fenestration system surface. This must be a valid name that has been associated with a Window contained in the same EnergyPlus input data file. The geometry for the Complex Fenestration is taken from the geometry input for this standard EnergyPlus subsurface, hence the term “Doppelganger.”

Note that DElight only deals with the visible spectrum of light transmitted through a Complex Fenestration. To account for the solar/thermal influences of a Complex Fenestration, a geometrically coincident subsurface that will be accounted for by methods already within EnergyPlus must be defined in the input data file. This is an interim solution to the issue of accounting for solar/thermal influences that will likely change as techniques analogous to the daylighting analysis of BTDF are developed.

#### Field: Fenestration Rotation

The in-plane counter-clockwise rotation angle between the Complex Fenestration optical reference direction and the base edge of the Doppelganger Surface geometry. The Complex Fenestration optical reference direction is the direction of the zero azimuth angle for the BDTF dataset. This Rotation angle will typically be zero when the Doppelganger surface is rectangular and its width edge is aligned with the Complex Fenestration optical reference direction.

An IDF example for an analytical WINDOW type CFS:

```idf
Daylighting:DELight:ComplexFenestration,
    Window CFS,       !- DElight Complex Fenestration User Name
    BTDF^GEN^WINDOW^1.0^20.0,     !- Complex Fenestration Type
    ZN003:WALL001,  !- Complex Fenestration Host Surface
    Zn003:Wall001:Doppel001, !- Doppelganger Surface Name
    0.0;            !- Fenestration Rotation {deg}
```

### DElight Output

In addition to the daylighting-specific outputs for DElight listed below, two ASCII text files are created during an EnergyPlus run that includes DElight analysis.  Following completion of an EnergyPlus run, these files are given names that consist of the project name appended with DElight.in and DElight.out.  The format of these files is described in the Output Details and Examples document.

#### Site Beam Solar Radiation Luminous Efficacy [lum/W]

A measure of the visible light content of beam solar radiation; equal to the number of lumens per watt of beam solar radiation. Depends on atmospheric conditions (moisture, turbidity, cloudiness) and solar altitude.

#### Daylighting Window Reference Point 2 View Luminance [cd/m2]

The area-averaged luminance of an exterior window as viewed from the second reference point, if present, in the daylit zone containing the window. Note that, for a bare window, this value can be different from the corresponding value at the first reference point since different regions of the sky and ground will be visible from the two reference points, and different ranges of angles of incidence and associated glass transmittance values will be involved. (Not printed for exterior windows in daylit zones with interior windows.)

#### Daylighting Lighting Power Multiplier []

The amount by which the overhead electric lighting power in a zone is multiplied due to usage of daylighting to dim or switch electric lights. For example, if the multiplier is M and the electric power without dimming is P, then the electric power with dimming is M\*P. The multiplier varies from 0.0, which corresponds to maximum dimming (zero electric lighting), to 1.0, which corresponds to no dimming.

### Output:IlluminanceMap

The Output:IlluminanceMap object expands on the reporting capabilities of the daylighting simulation. For any zone simulated with Daylighting:Controls, the illuminance map can generate up to 2,500 points of additional daylighting illuminance values. The resulting map is output as a comma delimited text file that can be imported into a spreadsheet program for rapid visualization of the daylighting illuminance patterns in a zone. The values are produced on an hourly basis. The Z height of the map is constant (parallel to a flat floor). More than one illuminance map can be created for a zone.

#### Field: Name

The name of the map object.

#### Field: Zone Name

Reference to a zone with Daylighting:Controls.

#### Field: Z Height

The height or elevation of the grid of daylighting points.

#### Field: X Minimum Coordinate

The minimum X coordinate boundary for the map.

#### Field: X Maximum Coordinate

The maximum X coordinate boundary for the map.

#### Field: Number of X Grid Points

The number of daylighting reference points in the X direction from the minimum to the maximum boundaries. The maximum number of points that can be generated is 2500 (Number of X Grid Points X Number of Y Grid Points).

#### Field: Y Minimum Coordinate

The minimum Y coordinate boundary for the map.

#### Field: Y Maximum Coordinate

Note:  Daylighting factors cannot be accurately calculated for reference points that are very close to a wall or window (less than 0.15 m or 6 inches). An error is reported for a reference point that is too close to a window, but no error is reported for a point that is too close to a wall.

```idf

Since not all zones are rectangular, it is possible to have map points that are outside the zone. Any illuminance registered at these points is inaccurate and, additionally, a “\*” marks these values for easy observance.

### OutputControl:IlluminanceMap:Style

This object specifies the “style” for the illuminance map output (described in the Output Details and Examples document). As described early in the document (see: EnergyPlus Output Processing), the user may select the “style” for the daylighting illuminance map output file (eplusmap.&lt;ext&gt;).

#### Field: Column Separator

For this field, the desired separator for columns is entered. “Comma” creates comma separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplusmap.csv file is created). “Tab” creates tab separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplusmap.tab file is created). “Fixed” creates space separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplusmap.txt file is created) but these are not necessarily lined up for easy printing.

Note that both tab and comma separated files easily import into Excel™ or other spreadsheet programs. The tab delimited files can also be viewed by text editors, word processing programs and easily converted to “tables” within those programs.

### Daylighting Devices

Daylighting devices work in conjunction with the Daylighting:Controls object to simulate components that can improve daylighting in a zone.

Daylighting devices are also tightly integrated into the zone heat balance. The thermal effects of these devices are simulated with or without the use of a Daylighting:Controls object.

There are two types of daylighting device in EnergyPlus:  tubular daylighting devices and daylighting shelves.

### DaylightingDevice:Tubular

Tubular daylighting devices (TDDs), also known as tubular skylights or light pipes, are used to bring natural exterior daylight into the hard-to-reach, interior spaces of a building.

TDDs consist of three components: a dome, a pipe, and a diffuser.

![DaylightingTubular](media/image108.png)

Figure 66. Tubular daylighting device diagram.

In EnergyPlus each of these components corresponds to an object in the input file.

The dome and diffuser are defined in the same way as windows using the FenestrationSurface:Detailed object. The *Surface Type* field must be specified as TubularDaylightDome or TubularDaylightDiffuser accordingly.

The location and orientation of the dome surface affect the total amount of daylight collected.

The *Base Surface* of the diffuser object determines to which zone the daylighting is delivered. The location and orientation of the diffuser surface affect the amount of daylight received at the Daylighting:Controls reference points.

Although the object definition is the same as for a window, there are several restrictions on TubularDaylightDome and TubularDaylightDiffuser objects:

- Shading control devices are not allowed.

- Frames and dividers are not allowed.

- Multipliers must be 1.0.

- Dome, diffuser, and pipe areas (as given by diameter) must be approximately equal.

- Outside face environment objects are not allowed.

- Dome and diffuser constructions cannot be more than one layer.

Since commercial TDDs are assumed to be cylindrical in shape, it is recommended that the circular areas of the actual dome and diffuser be approximated with a square of equivalent area for the TubularDaylightDome and TubularDaylightDiffuser objects. Although it is possible to use a triangular surface instead, a square is a much better geometric approximation of a circle.

Note that the TubularDaylightDome surface is allowed to have a different position and tilt from the roof base surface. If the actual TDD projects some height above the roof surface, the TubularDaylightDome coordinates should be located accordingly.

![](media/image109.png)

Figure 67. Tubular daylighting device DXF output.

The TubularDaylightDome surface automatically casts a shadow on the roof base surface. However, since the pipe is not represented by a surface, it will not cast a shadow. If this effect must be simulated, one or more SURFACE:SHADING objects can be used.

The dome and diffuser objects are connected by the DAYLIGHTING DEVICE:TUBULAR object:

#### Field: Name

The name of the TDD object.

#### Field: Dome Name

Reference to a FenestrationSurface:Detailed object with *Surface Type* TubularDaylightDome.

#### Field: Diffuser Name

Reference to a FenestrationSurface:Detailed object with *Surface Type* TubularDaylightDiffuser.

#### Field: Construction Name

The construction of the TDD pipe. The visible and solar absorptance of the inside material layer determines the reflectivity of the inner mirrored surface of the TDD. This is very important for the overall transmittance of the TDD.

#### Field: Diameter

The diameter [m] of the TDD pipe. The area of the pipe must match the areas of the dome and diffuser.

#### Field: Total Length

The total length [m] of the TDD pipe between the dome and the diffuser, including the exterior part above the roof. The exterior length is determined internally by subtracting the transition zone lengths from the total length.

#### Field: Effective Thermal Resistance

The effective thermal resistance [m<sup>2</sup>-K/W], i.e. R-value, of the TDD between the exterior dome surface and the interior diffuser surface.

#### Field: Transition Zone&lt;\#&gt;  Name

Name of zone that the TDD pipe passes through before reaching the delivery zone.

#### Field: Transition Zone &lt;\#&gt; Length

Length of pipe [m] in the transition zone. This is used for determining heat gains due to solar absorbed by the pipe in each transition zone. The distribution of absorbed solar gains can be customized by adjusting the length of pipe in each transition zone.   The transition zone gain is proportional to the length of pipe in the zone. If no transition zones are specified, all solar absorbed by the pipe is lost to the exterior environment.

The *Transition Zone Name* and *Transition Zone Length* fields can be repeated for additional transition zones.

### DaylightingDevice:Shelf

Daylighting shelves, or simply light shelves, are another device for bringing more daylight into a building. Installed as an accessory to a window, daylighting shelves work by reflecting exterior light onto the ceiling of a room. Daylighting shelves can have an inside shelf, an outside shelf, or both.



![DaylightingShelf](media/image110.png)

Figure 68. Daylighting shelf diagram.



The inside shelf redistributes light that would have entered the zone anyway. Instead of entering as a beam, all light is reflected onto the zone ceiling and is converted to diffuse shortwave radiation.

The outside shelf changes the amount of light entering the zone. If the shelf surface is more reflective than the ground, it can increase the amount of light incident on the upper part of the window. However, the shading effect of the outside shelf on the lower part of the window must also be considered as it can easily negate any gain achieved in the upper part of the window. All light reflected from the outside shelf that enters the upper window is assumed to strike the ceiling.

![](media/image111.png)

Figure 69. Daylighting shelf DXF output.

In EnergyPlus a daylighting shelf is simulated using a DaylightingDevice:Shelf object in combination with up to three other objects: a window, a heat transfer surface, and an attached shading surface.

The window must be divided into two window surfaces: an upper window and a lower window. The upper window interacts directly with the daylighting shelf object and is not allowed to have any shading control devices or frames or dividers. The lower window does not interact with the daylighting shelf object, but does receive shading from the outside shelf. There are no restrictions on the lower window.

The inside shelf is defined as a regular heat transfer surface in the zone. However, the surface must have the *Outside Boundary Condition* field set to Surface with itself as the other zone surface. Shading and thermal mass effects are taken into account.

The outside shelf is defined as a Shading:Zone:Detailed object. The visible and solar absorptance of the outside material layer determines the reflectivity of the shelf.

NOTE:  Unlike a regular Shading:Zone:Detailed object, the vertices of the outside shelf surface must be ordered so that the outward normal vector points *upward*, i.e. toward the upper window. This is necessary in order for the outside shelf to properly receive sunlight and shading from other surfaces. A mirror shading surface with the outward normal vector pointing in the opposite direction is automatically created by the program to shade the lower window.

The inside shelf and outside shelf are both optional. However, if neither shelf is specified, the daylighting shelf object has no effect on the simulation.

#### Field: Name

The name of the daylighting shelf object.

#### Field: Window Name

Reference to a FenestrationSurface:Detailed object with *Surface Type* WINDOW.

#### Field: Inside Shelf Name

Reference to a BuildingSurface:Detailed object. This field is optional. If used, this surface must have OTHERZONESURFACE specified for the *Outside Face Environment* field and the referenced other zone surface must be itself. The number of vertices of this surface object must be 4.

#### Field: Outside Shelf Name

Reference to a Shading:Zone:Detailed object. This field is optional. If used, the number of vertices of this surface object must be 4.

#### Field: Outside Shelf Construction Name

Reference to a CONSTRUCTION object. This field is required if an outside shelf is specified. The visible and solar absorptance of the outside material layer determines the shelf reflectivity.

#### Field: View Factor To Outside Shelf

User defined value for the view factor from the window to the outside shelf. This field is optional. If not specified, an exact view factor is calculated for two perpendicular rectangles of the same width having a shared edge. If the given surfaces do not meet these geometric requirements, it is necessary to specify a value here.

NOTE:  It is up to the user to adjust the view factor to ground of the upper window to account for the part of the view blocked by the outside shelf. The calculated *View Factor To Outside Shelf* is reported in the eio file for this purpose. For the typical case where the shelf is parallel to the ground and the upper window is perpendicular to the ground, the view factor to ground is simply:  0.5 – *View Factor To Outside Shelf*.

### DaylightingDevice:LightWell

This object is used to model the impacts on daylighting of a “light well” that might be associated with exterior windows such as skylights.  The light well model attenuates the light transmitted by the skylight. The attenuation is characterized by the **well efficiency**, which is the ratio of the amount of light leaving the well to the amount of light entering the well. The well efficiency varies from close to 1.0  to close to zero if there is high attenuation. The well efficiency is used only in the EnergyPlus detailed daylighting calculation, where it multiplies the beam and diffuse light transmitted by the skylight. (The well efficiency is not used in calculating the solar gain through the skylight.)

The input object describes the light well using basic characteristics of the geometry along with the visible reflectance of the well’s side walls.  The following figure diagrams how the geometry is characterized.

![](media/image112.svg)

Figure 70. Skylight with light well: (a) perspective view, (b) vertical section.
 If the bottom of the light well is a rectangle of side lengths c and d, as shown in (a), then the perimeter of the bottom of the well = 2(c+d) and the area = cd (see description of field names for the Light Well object).

#### Field: Exterior Window Name

The name of the exterior window that this Light Well is associated with. Generally this is a skylight in a roof. However, light wells can be applied to an exterior window of any slope. Light wells can be assigned to both rectangular and triangular exterior windows, but they should not be assigned to interior windows. Note that the sides of the light well can be sloped and the bottom of the light well can be any shape, not  just rectangular.

#### Field: Height of Well

The distance from the bottom of the skylight to the bottom of the well. If the skylight and well bottom are not coplanar, this is the distance from the center of the bottom of the skylight to center of the bottom of the well. See Figure 70.

#### Field: Perimeter of Bottom of Well

The perimeter of the bottom opening of the well. See Figure 70.

#### Field: Area of Bottom of Well

The area of the bottom opening of the well. A warning will be issued if this area is less that the area of the skylight, including frame if present. See Figure 70.

#### Field: Visible Reflectance of Well Walls

The visible reflectance of the side walls of the well. If the walls do not all have the same reflectance, an area-weighted average value can be used.  This is the well-wall reflectance expressed as a fraction.



An IDF example:

```idf
DaylightingDevice:LightWell,  ! The well is 60% reflecting, is 1.2m high and has a 2.5m x 5.5m bottom opening.

Group – Exterior Energy Use Equipment
-------------------------------------

To facilitate the reporting of exterior consumption (to the building’s heat balance/loads considerations), several objects have been included. The consumption related to these items will appear on meters specific to the items.

### Exterior:Lights

#### Field: Name

This descriptive name allows the values of exterior lights consumption to appear in the “normal” output variable list as well as the meters. It cannot be blank nor can it be duplicated by other Exterior:Lights statements.

#### Field: Schedule Name

A schedule will allow the exterior lights consumption to be operationally different, hour to hour as well as seasonally. Fractional values in the basic schedule will be applied to the design level field below.

#### Field: Design Level

This field (in Watts) is typically used to represent the maximum electrical input to exterior lighting fixtures that is then multiplied by a schedule fraction (see previous field). In EnergyPlus, this is slightly more flexible in that the lighting design level could be a “diversity factor” applied to a schedule of real numbers. Note that while the schedule value can vary from hour to hour and seasonally, the design level field is constant for all simulation environments.

#### Field: Control Option

This field is used to determine how the exterior lights are controlled. There are currently two options, ‘ScheduleNameOnly’ and ‘AstronomicalClock.’  If this field is omitted or left blank then the program will default to Schedule Name Only mode. The ‘ScheduleNameOnly’ mode dictates that the exterior lights always follow the schedule named in the field above. The ‘AstronomicalClock’ mode dictates that despite what the schedule indicates, the exterior lights will not run when the sun is up. Using the Astronomical Clock mode makes it simple to model exterior lights that are controlled by a photocell or other controller that ensures that outdoor lights will not run during the daytime. However, the Astronomical Clock control works off of the position of the sun and therefore does not operate exactly like a photocell. During the night, the schedule values are still applied in the usual way.

#### Field: End-Use Subcategory

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., "Grounds Lights", "Facade Lights", etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory  (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table. If this field is omitted or blank, the lights will be assigned to the "General" end-use subcategory.

An IDF Example:

```idf

  OutsideLights,       !- Name

This field designates the appropriate meter for the exterior fuel equipment. Valid fuel types are: Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, Diesel, Gasoline, Coal, Steam, DistrictHeating, DistrictCooling, OtherFuel1 and OtherFuel2. The fuel type triggers the application of consumption amounts to the appropriate energy meters.

#### Field: Schedule Name

A schedule will allow the exterior lights consumption to be operationally different, hour to hour as well as seasonally. Fractional values in the basic schedule will be applied to the design level field below.

#### Field: Design Level

This field (Watts) is typically used to represent the maximum input to exterior fixtures that is then multiplied by a schedule fraction (see previous field). In EnergyPlus, this is slightly more flexible in that the design level could be a “diversity factor” applied to a schedule of real numbers. Note that while the schedule value can vary from hour to hour and seasonally, the design level field is constant for all simulation environments.

#### Field: End-Use Subcategory

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., "Fountains", etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory  (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table. If this field is omitted or blank, the equipment will be assigned to the "General" end-use subcategory.

### Exterior:WaterEquipment

#### Field: Name

This descriptive name allows the values of exterior equipment consumption to appear in the “normal” output variable list as well as the meters. It cannot be blank nor can it be duplicated by other Exterior:FuelEquipment or Exterior:WaterEquipment statements.

#### Field: FuelUseType

For Exterior:WaterEquipment, only “Water” is current allowed for this field.

#### Field: Schedule Name

A schedule will allow the exterior water consumption to be operationally different, hour to hour as well as seasonally. Fractional values in the basic schedule will be applied to the design level field below.

#### Field: Design Level

This field (in m3/s) is typically used to represent the maximum volumetric flow for water fixtures that is then multiplied by a schedule fraction (see previous field). In EnergyPlus, this is slightly more flexible in that the exterior water equipment design level could be a “diversity factor” applied to a schedule of real numbers. Note that while the schedule value can vary from hour to hour and seasonally, the design level field is constant for all simulation environments.

#### Field: End-Use Subcategory

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., "Landscaping", etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory  (ref: Output:Meter objects).

Group – Airflow
---------------

An important characteristic of energy consumption in buildings is the airflow between zones and airflow due to natural ventilation (e.g., open windows) or mechanically-induced ventilation (e.g., exhaust air fans). This group of objects describes those elements.

The AirflowNetwork model can also be used to model infiltration and mixing (zone-to-zone air flow) with or without the HVAC air distribution system operating (see Group – Airflow Network).

### ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate

Infiltration is the unintended flow of air from the outdoor environment directly into a thermal zone. Infiltration is generally caused by the opening and closing of exterior doors, cracks around windows, and even in very small amounts through building elements. The basic equation used to calculate infiltration with this object is:

<div>\[Infiltration = \left( {{I_{design}}} \right)\left( {{F_{schedule}}} \right)\left[ {A + B\left| {\left( {{T_{zone}} - {T_{odb}}} \right)} \right| + C\left( {WindSpeed} \right) + D\left( {Windspee{d^2}} \right)} \right]\]</div>

More advanced infiltration calculations are possible using the EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork model for natural infiltration driven by wind and/or by forced air. Infiltration described by the equation shown above is entered into EnergyPlus using the following syntax. Exfiltration (the leakage of zone air to the outside) is generally handled better as zone exhaust air in the zone equipment description. The equation must always yield a non-negative results; negative values are set to 0.0.

The question of typical values for these coefficients is subject to debate. Ideally, one should do a detailed analysis of the infiltration situation and then determine a custom set of coefficients using methods such as those laid out in Chapter 26 of the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals. The EnergyPlus defaults are 1,0,0,0 which give a constant volume flow of infiltration under all conditions.

BLAST (one of the EnergyPlus predecessors) used the following values as defaults:  0.606, 0.03636, 0.1177, 0. These coefficients produce a value of 1.0 at 0C deltaT and 3.35 m/s (7.5 mph) windspeed, which corresponds to a typical summer condition. At a winter condition of 40C deltaT and 6 m/s (13.4 mph) windspeed, these coefficients would increase the infiltration rate by a factor of 2.75.

In DOE-2 (the other EnergyPlus predecessor), the air change method defaults are (adjusted to SI units) 0, 0, 0.224 (windspeed), 0. With these coefficients, the summer conditions above would give a factor of 0.75, and the winter conditions would give 1.34. A windspeed of 4.47 m/s (10 mph) gives a factor of 1.0.

The source of the BLAST defaults is noted in the BLAST documentation as:

"Empirical equation and the coefficient default were determined from ASHRAE journal articles and other data on the effects of outdoor weather conditions."

The source of the DOE-2 defaults is based on examining the infiltration relationships described in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals.

The EnergyPlus example files use all of the above, the BLAST defaults in some (e.g., GeometryTest), the DOE-2 defaults in some (e.g., 5ZoneAirCooled), and the EnergyPlus defaults in some (e.g., LgOffVAVDetCoil).

The local outdoor dry-bulb temperature used in the above basic equation (T<sub>odb</sub>) is typically a function of the height of the zone centroid above ground. The corresponding zone name is given in the second field. The local outdoor dry-bulb temperature calculation procedure is given in the section of “Local Outdoor Air Temperature Calculation” in the Engineering Reference.

The local outdoor wind speed used in the above basic equation (WindSpeed) is also a function of the height of the zone centroid above ground. The corresponding zone name is given in the second filed. The local outdoor wind speed calculation procedure is given in the section of “Local Wind Speed Calculation” in the Engineering Reference.

Note: When the value of the Wind Speed Profile Exponent field in the Site:HeightVariation is equal to 0.0. The local wind speed is always equal to the wind speed given in the weather data and will not be dependent on zone centroid height.  Similarly, if the value of the Air Temperature Gradient Coefficient is set equal to 0 the local air dry-bulb temperature is also always equal to the air dry-bulb temperature given in the weather data and will not be dependent on zone centroid height.

One or more infiltration objects can be defined for each zone, and the resulting infiltration rate for the zone will simply be the summation of the flow rates specified by the infiltration objects.

#### Field: Name

The name of the ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate object. This needs to be unique across all different ZoneInfiltration objects.

#### Field: Zone or ZoneList Name

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) or ZoneList (ref: ZoneLIst) and attaches a particular infiltration statement to a thermal zone or set of thermal zones in the building. When the ZoneList option is used then this infiltration definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for the amount of infiltration flow rate in the zone. The Zonelist option can be used effectively with the flow/area, flow/exteriorarea, flow/exteriorwallarea, or airchanges/hour of the Design Flow Rate Calculation Method.

The name of the actual infiltration object becomes &lt;Zone Name&gt; &lt;ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate Object Name&gt; and should be less than the standard length (100 characters) for a name field. If it is greater than this standard length, it may be difficult to specify in output reporting as it will be truncated. A warning will be shown if the generated name is greater than 100 characters. If it duplicates another such concatenated name, there will be a severe error and terminate the run.

#### Field: Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that modifies the maximum design volume flow rate (I<sub>design</sub>) (see Design Flow Rate Calculation Method field and related subsequent fields). This fraction between 0.0 and 1.0 is noted as F<sub>schedule</sub> in the above equation.

#### Field: Design Flow Rate Calculation Method

- Flow/Zone

With this choice, the method used will be a straight insertion of the design volume flow rate.  (The Design Flow Rate field should be filled.)

- Flow/Area

With this choice, the method used will be a factor per floor area of the zone. (The flow per Zone Area field should be filled).

- AirChanges/Hour

With this choice, the method used will be the number of air changes per hour for the infiltration amount. This factor, along with the Zone Volume, will be used to determine the Design Flow Rate. (The Air Changes per Hour field should be filled).

#### Field: Design Flow Rate

This field denotes the full design volume flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/s). The previous field should choose “flow/zone” as the choice. The design volume flow rate (noted as I<sub>design</sub> in the above equation) is the maximum amount of infiltration expected at design conditions. The design value is modified by the schedule fraction (see Field:Schedule Name) and user specified coefficients (see ”coefficient” fields below). The resulting volume flow rate is converted to mass flow using the current outdoor air density at each time step.

#### Field: Flow per Zone Floor Area

This factor (m<sup>3</sup>/s-m<sup>2</sup>) is used, along with the Zone Area to determine the maximum Design Flow Rate as described in the Design Flow Rate field. The choice from the method field should be “Flow/Area”.

#### Field: Flow per Exterior Surface Area

This factor (m<sup>3</sup>/s-m<sup>2</sup>) is used, along with the Exterior Surface Area in the Zone to determine the maximum Design Flow Rate as described in the Design Flow Rate field. The choice from the method field should be “Flow/Exteriorarea” or “Flow/ExteriorWallArea”.

#### Field: Air Changes per Hour

This factor is used, along with the Zone Volume to determine the maximum Design Flow Rate as described in the Design Flow Rate field. The choice from the method field should be “AirChanges/Hour”.

#### Field: Constant Term Coefficient

This number is the “A” parameter in the above infiltration equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter, however, is a constant under all conditions and is not modified by any environmental effect. As a result, it is dimensionless.

#### Field: Temperature Term Coefficient

This number is the “B” parameter in the above infiltration equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by the temperature difference between the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperatures. The units for this parameter are inverse Celsius.

#### Field: Velocity Term Coefficient

This number is the “C” parameter in the above infiltration equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by the speed of wind being experienced outside the building. The units for this parameter are s/m.

#### Field: Velocity Squared Term Coefficient

This number is the “D” parameter in the above infiltration equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by square of the speed of wind being experienced outside the building. The units for this parameter are s<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>.

### ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea

ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea model is similar to the other infiltration objects but uses a different equation to model the unintended flow of air from the outdoor environment directly into a thermal zone.  Infiltration is generally caused by the opening and closing of exterior doors, cracks around windows, and even in very small amounts through building elements.  This model is based on work by Sherman and Grimsrud (1980) and is appropriate for smaller, residential-type buildings.  The equation used to calculate infiltration in the effective leakage area model is:

<div>\[Infiltration = \left( {{F_{Schedule}}} \right)\frac{{{A_L}}}{{1000}}\sqrt {{C_s}\Delta T + {C_w}{{\left( {WindSpeed} \right)}^2}} \]</div>

where <span>\(\Delta T\)</span> is the average difference between zone air temperature and the outdoor air temperature and the other coefficients are described below.

Note that the coefficients for the “EffectiveLeakageArea” model are not interchangeable with the similarly named coefficients in the “FlowCoefficient” model (see ZoneInfiltration:FlowCoefficient object).

One or more infiltration objects of different types can be defined for each zone, and the resulting infiltration rate for the zone will simply be the summation of the flow rates specified by the infiltration objects.

### ZoneInfiltration:FlowCoefficient

ZoneInfiltration:FlowCoefficient model is similar to the other infiltration objects but uses a different equation to model the unintended flow of air from the outdoor environment directly into a thermal zone.  Infiltration is generally caused by the opening and closing of exterior doors, cracks around windows, and even in very small amounts through building elements.  This reformulated model is based on the AIM-2 model by Walker and Wilson (1998) and is appropriate for smaller, residential-type buildings.  The equation used to calculate infiltration in the flow coefficient model is:

<div>\[Infiltration = \left( {{F_{Schedule}}} \right)\sqrt {{{\left( {c\,{C_s}\Delta {T^n}} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {c\,{C_w}{{\left( {s * WindSpeed} \right)}^{2n}}} \right)}^2}} \]</div>

### ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate

Ventilation is the purposeful flow of air from the outdoor environment directly into a thermal zone in order to provide some amount of non-mechanical cooling. Ventilation, as specified by the input syntax for the ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate object, is intended to model “simple” ventilation as opposed to the more detailed ventilation investigations that can be performed with the AirflowNetwork model or with air systems that have outdoor air mixers. Zone ventilation, as specified via this input object, can be controlled by a schedule and through the specification of minimum, maximum and delta temperatures as described below. The temperatures can be either single constant values for the entire simulation or schedules which can vary over time. As with infiltration, the actual flow rate of ventilation air can be modified by the temperature difference between the inside and outside environment and the wind speed. The basic equation used to calculate ventilation with this model is:

<div>\[Ventilation = \left( {{V_{design}}} \right)\left( {{F_{schedule}}} \right)\left[ {A + B\left| {{T_{zone}} - {T_{odb}}} \right| + C\left( {WindSpeed} \right) + D\left( {WindSpee{d^2}} \right)} \right]\]</div>

Similar to infiltration, the question of typical values for these coefficients is subject to debate. Ideally, one should do a detailed analysis of the ventilation situation and then determine a custom set of coefficients using methods such as those laid out in Chapter 26 of the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals. The EnergyPlus defaults are 1,0,0,0 which give a constant volume flow of ventilation under all conditions. The following discussion is duplicated from the infiltration design flow rate object. The equation must always yield a non-negative results; negative values are set to 0.0.

BLAST (one of the EnergyPlus predecessors) used the following values as defaults:  0.606, 0.03636, 0.1177, 0. These coefficients produce a value of 1.0 at 0C deltaT and 3.35 m/s (7.5 mph) windspeed, which corresponds to a typical summer condition. At a winter condition of 40C deltaT and 6 m/s (13.4 mph) windspeed, these coefficients would increase the infiltration rate by a factor of 2.75.

In DOE-2 (the other EnergyPlus predecessor), the air change method defaults are (adjusted to SI units) 0, 0, 0.224 (windspeed), 0. With these coefficients, the summer conditions above would give a factor of 0.75, and the winter conditions would give 1.34. A windspeed of 4.47 m/s (10 mph) gives a factor of 1.0.

The source of the BLAST defaults is noted in the BLAST documentation as:

"Empirical equation and the coefficient default were determined from ASHRAE journal articles and other data on the effects of outdoor weather conditions."

The source of the DOE-2 defaults is based on examining the *infiltration* relationships described in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals.

The local outdoor dry-bulb temperature used in the above basic equation (T<sub>odb</sub>) is typically a function of the height of the zone centroid above ground. The corresponding zone name is given in the second field. The local outdoor dry-bulb temperature calculation procedure is described in the “Local Outdoor Air Temperature Calculation” section of the Engineering Reference.

The local outdoor wind speed used in the above basic equation (WindSpeed) is also a function of the height of the zone centroid above ground. The corresponding zone name is given in the second field. The local outdoor wind speed calculation procedure is described in the “Local Wind Speed Calculation” section of the Engineering Reference.

Note: When the value of the Wind Speed Profile Exponent field in the Site:HeightVariation object is equal to 0.0, the local wind speed is always equal to the wind speed given in the weather data and will not be dependent on zone centroid height.  Similarly, if the value of the Air Temperature Gradient Coefficient is set equal to 0, the local air dry-bulb temperature is also always equal to the air dry-bulb temperature given in the weather data and will not be dependent on zone centroid height.

One or more ventilation objects (i.e., ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate and/or ZoneVentilation:WindandStackOpenArea) can be defined for each zone, and the resulting ventilation rate for the zone will simply be the summation of the flow rates specified by the ventilation objects.

More advanced ventilation calculations are possible using the EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork model.

#### Field: Name

#### Field: Zone or ZoneList Name

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) or ZoneList (ref: ZoneList) and attaches a particular ventilation statement to a thermal zone or set of thermal zones in the building. When the ZoneList option is used then this ventilation definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for the amount of infiltration flow rate in the zone. The Zonelist option can be used effectively with the flow/area, flow/person, or airchanges/hour of the Design Flow Rate Calculation Method.

The name of the actual ventilation object becomes &lt;Zone Name&gt; &lt;ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate Object Name&gt; and should be less than the standard length (100 characters) for a name field. If it is greater than this standard length, it may be difficult to specify in output reporting as it will be truncated. A warning will be shown if the generated name is greater than 100 characters. If it duplicates another such concatenated name, there will be a severe error and terminate the run.

#### Field: Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that modifies the maximum design volume flow rate (V<sub>design</sub>) (see Design Flow Rate Calculation Method field and related subsequent fields). This fraction between 0.0 and 1.0 is noted as F<sub>schedule</sub> in the above equation.

#### Field: Design Flow Rate Calculation Method

#### Field: Design Flow Rate

This field denotes the full design volume flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/s). The previous field should choose “flow/zone” as the choice. The design volume flow rate (noted as V<sub>design</sub> in the above equation) is the maximum amount of ventilation expected at design conditions. The design value is modified by the schedule fraction (see Field: Schedule Name) and user specified coefficients (see four “coefficient” fields below).

This factor (m<sup>3</sup>/s-m<sup>2</sup>) is used, along with the Zone Area to determine the maximum Design Volume Flow Rate as described in the Design Volume Flow Rate field. The choice from the method field should be “flow/area”.

#### Field: Flow Rate per Person

This factor (m<sup>3</sup>/s-person) is used, along with the nominal (maximum) number of occupants (people) in the Zone to determine the maximum Design Volume Flow Rate as described in the Design Volume Flow Rate field. The choice from the method field should be “flow/person”.

#### Field: Air Changes per Hour

With this choice, the method used will be the number of air changes per hour for the ventilation amount. This factor, along with the Zone Volume, will be used to determine the Design Flow Rate. The choice from the method field should be “AirChanges/Hour”.

#### Field: Ventilation Type

This alpha character string defines the type of ventilation as one of the following options: Natural, Exhaust, Intake, or Balanced. Natural ventilation is assumed to be air movement/exchange as a result of openings in the building façade and will not consume any fan energy. Values for fan pressure and efficiency for natural ventilation are ignored. For either Exhaust or Intake, values for fan pressure and efficiency define the fan electric consumption. For Natural and Exhaust ventilation, the conditions of the air entering the space are assumed to be equivalent to outside air conditions. For Intake and Balanced ventilation, an appropriate amount of fan heat is added to the entering air stream. For Balanced ventilation, both an intake fan and an exhaust fan are assumed to co-exist, both having the same flow rate and power consumption (using the entered values for fan pressure rise and fan total efficiency). Thus, the fan electric consumption for Balanced ventilation is twice that for the Exhaust or Intake ventilation types which employ only a single fan.

#### Field: Fan Pressure Rise

This is the pressure rise experienced across the fan in Pascals (N/m<sup>2</sup>). This is a function of the fan and plays a role in determining the amount of energy consumed by the fan.

#### Field: Fan Total Efficiency

This value is the overall efficiency of the fan, i.e., the ratio of the power delivered to the fluid to the electrical input power. It is the product of the motor efficiency and the impeller efficiency. The motor efficiency is the power delivered to the shaft divided by the electrical power input to the motor. The impeller efficiency is power delivered to the fluid (air) divided by the shaft power. The power delivered to the fluid is the mass flow rate of the air multiplied by the pressure rise divided by the air density. This input value must be between 0 and 1."

#### Field: Constant Term Coefficient

This number is the “A” parameter in the above ventilation equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter, however, is a constant under all conditions and is not modified by any environmental effect. As a result, it is dimensionless.

#### Field: Temperature Term Coefficient

This number is the “B” parameter in the above ventilation equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by the temperature difference between the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperatures. The units for this parameter are inverse Celsius.

#### Field: Velocity Term Coefficient

This number is the “C” parameter in the above ventilation equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by the speed of wind being experienced outside the building. The units for this parameter are s/m.

#### Field: Velocity Squared Term Coefficient

This number is the “D” parameter in the above ventilation equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by square of the speed of wind being experienced outside the building. The units for this parameter are s<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>.

#### Field: Minimum Indoor Temperature

This is the indoor temperature (in Celsius) below which ventilation is shutoff. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the maximum value is 100.0°C. The default value is -100.0°C if the field is left blank. This lower temperature limit is intended to avoid overcooling a space and thus result in a heating load. For example, if the user specifies a minimum temperature of 20°C, ventilation is assumed to be available if the zone air temperature is above 20°C. If the zone air temperature drops below 20°C, then ventilation is automatically turned off.

#### Field: Minimum Indoor Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field defines the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the minimum indoor temperature (in Celsius) below which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature value in the schedule can be -100°C and the maximum value can be 100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Minimum Indoor Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the minimum temperature values specified in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Minimum Indoor Temperature field.

#### Field: Maximum Indoor Temperature

This is the indoor temperature (in Celsius) above which ventilation is shutoff. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the maximum value is 100.0°C. The default value is 100.0°C if the field is left blank. This upper temperature limit is intended to avoid overheating a space and thus result in a cooling load. For example, if the user specifies a maximum temperature of 28°C, ventilation is assumed to be available if the zone air temperature is below 28°C. If the zone air temperature increases to 28°C, then ventilation is automatically turned off.

#### Field: Maximum Indoor Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field defines the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the maximum indoor temperature (in Celsius) above which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature value in the schedule can be -100°C and the maximum value can be 100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Maximum Indoor Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the maximum temperature values specified in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Maximum Indoor Temperature field.

#### Field: Delta Temperature

This is the temperature difference (in Celsius) between the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperatures below which ventilation is shutoff. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and thedefault value is also -100.0°C if the field is left blank. This field allows ventilation to be stopped if the temperature outside is too warm and could potentially heat the space. For example, if the user specifies a delta temperature of 2°C, ventilation is assumed to be available if the outside air temperature is at least 2°C cooler than the zone air temperature. If the outside air dry-bulb temperature is less than 2°C cooler than the indoor dry-bulb temperature, then ventilation is automatically turned off.

The values for this field can include negative numbers. This allows ventilation to occur even if the outdoor temperature is above the indoor temperature. The Delta Temperature is used in the code in the following way:

IF ((IndoorTemp - OutdoorTemp) &lt; DeltaTemperature) Then ventilation is not allowed.

Thus, if a large negative number is input for DeltaTemperature, the ventilation can be kept on even if the outdoor temperature is greater than the indoor temperature. This is useful for uncontrolled natural ventilation (open windows) or as a way to estimate the effect of required ventilation air for load calculations.

#### Field: Delta Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the temperature difference (in Celsius) between the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperatures below which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature difference value in the schedule can be -100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Delta Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the delta temperature values specified in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Delta Temperature field.

#### Field: Minimum Outdoor Temperature

This is the outdoor temperature (in Celsius) below which ventilation is shut off. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the maximum value is 100.0°C. The default value is           -100.0°C if the field is left blank. This lower temperature limit is intended to avoid overcooling a space, which could result in a heating load.

#### Field: Minimum Outdoor Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the minimum outdoor temperature (in Celsius) below which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature value in the schedule can be -100°C and the maximum value can be 100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Minimum Outdoor Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the temperature values in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Minimum Outdoor Temperature field.

#### Field: Maximum Outdoor Temperature

This is the outdoor temperature (in Celsius) above which ventilation is shut off. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the maximum value is 100.0°C. The default value is 100.0°C if the field is left blank. This upper temperature limit is intended to avoid overheating a space, which could result in a cooling load.

#### Field: Maximum Outdoor Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the minimum outdoor temperature (in Celsius) above which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature value in the schedule can be -100°C and the maximum value can be 100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Maximum Outdoor Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the temperature values in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Maximum Outdoor Temperature field.

#### Field: Maximum Wind Speed

This is the wind speed (m/s) above which ventilation is shut off. This can help simulate conditions where one would normally close windows to avoid chaos in a space (papers blowing around, etc.).

### ZoneVentilation:WindandStackOpenArea

For this model, the ventilation air flow rate is a function of wind speed and thermal stack effect, along with the area of the opening being modeled. This object can be used alone or in combination with ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate objects. This model is intended for simplified ventilation calculations as opposed to the more detailed ventilation investigations that can be performed with the AirflowNetwork model. Using the “Wind and Stack with Open Area” model, the natural ventilation flow rate can be controlled by a multiplier fraction schedule applied to the user-defined opening area and through the specification of minimum, maximum and delta temperatures. The temperatures can be either single constant values for the entire simulation or schedules which can vary over time. The equation used to calculate the ventilation rate driven by wind is:

<div>\[{Q_w} = {C_w}{A_{opening}}{F_{schedule}}V\]</div>

where,

      *Q<sub>w</sub>*        = Volumetric air flow rate driven by wind [m<sup>3</sup>/s]

      *C<sub>w</sub>*        = Opening effectiveness [dimensionless]

      *A<sub>opening</sub>*  = Opening area [m<sup>2</sup>]

      *F<sub>schedule</sub>* = Open area fraction [user-defined schedule value, dimensionless]

      *V*          = Local wind speed [m/s]

The equation used to calculate the ventilation rate due to stack effect is:

<div>\[{Q_s} = {C_D}{A_{opening}}{F_{schedule}}\sqrt {2g\Delta {H_{NPL}}(|{T_{zone}} - {T_{odb}}|/{T_{zone}})} \]</div>

where,

      *Q<sub>s</sub>*        = Volumetric air flow rate due to stack effect [m<sup>3</sup>/s]

      *C<sub>D</sub>*        = Discharge coefficient for opening [dimensionless]

      *A<sub>opening</sub>*  = Opening area [m<sup>2</sup>]

      *F<sub>schedule</sub>* = Open area fraction [user-defined schedule value, dimensionless]

      *ΔH<sub>NPL</sub>*  = Height from midpoint of lower opening to the neutral pressure level [m].

Estimation of this value is difficult; refer to Chapter 16 of the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals for guidance.

      *T<sub>zone</sub>*      = Zone air dry-bulb temperature [K]

*T<sub>odb</sub>*<sub>            </sub> = Local outdoor air dry-bulb temperature [K]

The total ventilation rate calculated by this model is the quadrature sum of the wind and stack air flow components:

<div>\[Ventilatio{n_{WindAndStack}} = \sqrt {{Q_s}^2 + {Q_w}^2} \]</div>

The local outdoor air dry-bulb temperature used in the stack effect equation (T<sub>odb</sub>) is typically a function of the height of the zone centroid above ground. The corresponding zone name is given in the second field. The local outdoor air dry-bulb temperature calculation procedure is described in the “Local Outdoor Air Temperature Calculation” section of the Engineering Reference.

The local outdoor wind speed used in the above wind-driven equation (V) is also a function of the height of the zone centroid above ground. The corresponding zone name is given in the second field. The local outdoor wind speed calculation procedure is described in the “Local Wind Speed Calculation” section of the Engineering Reference.

Note: When the value of the Wind Speed Profile Exponent field in the Site:HeightVariation object is equal to 0.0, the local wind speed is always equal to the wind speed given in the weather data and will not be dependent on zone centroid height.  Similarly, if the value of the Air Temperature Gradient Coefficient is set equal to 0, the local air dry-bulb temperature is also always equal to the air dry-bulb temperature given in the weather data and will not be dependent on zone centroid height.

One or more ventilation objects (i.e., ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate and/or ZoneVentilation:WindandStackOpenArea) can be defined for each zone, and the resulting ventilation rate for the zone will simply be the summation of the flow rates specified by the ventilation objects.

More advanced ventilation calculations are possible using the EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork model.

#### Field: Name

The name of the ZoneVentilation:WindandStackOpenArea object.

#### Field: Zone Name

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) and attaches a particular ventilation statement to a thermal zone in the building.

#### Field: Opening Area

This is the opening area exposed to outdoors (m<sup>2</sup>) in a zone.

#### Field: Opening Area Fraction Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) which modifies the Opening Area value (see previous field). The schedule values must be any positive number between 0 and 1 as a fraction. The actual opening area in a zone for a particular simulation time step is defined as the product of the Opening Area input field and the value specified by the schedule named in this input field.

#### Field: Opening Effectiveness

This field is the opening effectiveness (C<sub>w</sub>). The value must be between 0.0 and 1.0 or the value can be autocalculated. If a real value is input, that constant value will be used in the calculations. Otherwise, this field can be left blank (default = Autocalculate) or the user can input **Autocalculate.** Based on recommended values provided in Chapter 16 of the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, C<sub>w</sub> = 0.55 for perpendicular winds and C<sub>w</sub> = 0.3 for diagonal winds. For Autocalculate, any angles between perpendicular and diagonal are linearly interpolated between 0.3 and 0.55 by the model.

#### Field: Effective Angle

This is the angle in degrees counting from the North clockwise to the opening outward normal. The value must be between 0 and 360, with the default being 0 if this input field is left blank. The Effective Angle is 0 if the opening outward normal faces North, 90 if faces East, 180 if faces South, and 270 if faces West. The value is fixed and independent of coordinate system defined in the GlobalGeometryRules object. This input field value is used to calculate the angle between the wind direction and the opening outward normal to determine the opening effectiveness values when the input field Opening Effectiveness = Autocalculate.

#### Field: Height Difference

This is the height difference between the midpoint of the lower opening and the neutral pressure level in meters. This value is a required user input.

Note: Estimation of the height difference is difficult for natural ventilated buildings. Chapter 16 of the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals may provide guidance for estimating the height difference.

#### Field: Discharge Coefficient for Opening

This is the discharge coefficient for the opening (C<sub>D</sub>). The value must be between 0.0 and 1.0, or the value can be autocalculated. If a real value is input, that constant value will be used in the calculations. Otherwise, this field can be left blank (default = Autocalculate) or the user can input **Autocalculate.** For Autocalculate, the program will determine the discharge coefficient based on the following equation:

<div>\[{C_D} = 0.40 + 0.0045\left| {{T_{zone}} - {T_{odb}}} \right|\]</div>

#### Field: Minimum Indoor Temperature

This is the indoor temperature (in Celsius) below which ventilation is shutoff. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the maximum value is 100.0°C. The default value is           -100.0°C if the field is left blank. This lower temperature limit is intended to avoid overcooling a space and thus result in a heating load. For example, if the user specifies a minimum temperature of 20°C, ventilation is assumed to be available if the zone air temperature is above 20°C. If the zone air temperature drops below 20°C, then ventilation is automatically turned off.

#### Field: Minimum Indoor Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field defines the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the minimum indoor temperature (in Celsius) below which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature value in the schedule can be -100°C and the maximum value can be 100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Minimum Indoor Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the minimum temperature values specified in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Minimum Indoor Temperature field.

#### Field: Maximum Indoor Temperature

This is the indoor temperature (in Celsius) above which ventilation is shutoff. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the maximum value is 100.0°C. The default value is 100.0°C if the field is left blank. This upper temperature limit is intended to avoid overheating a space and thus result in a cooling load. For example, if the user specifies a maximum temperature of 28°C, ventilation is assumed to be available if the zone air temperature is below 28°C. If the zone air temperature increases to 28°C, then ventilation is automatically turned off.

#### Field: Maximum Indoor Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field defines the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the maximum indoor temperature (in Celsius) above which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature value in the schedule can be -100°C and the maximum value can be 100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Maximum Indoor Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the maximum temperature values specified in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Maximum Indoor Temperature field.

#### Field: Delta Temperature

This is the temperature difference (in Celsius) between the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperatures below which ventilation is shutoff. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the default value is also -100.0°C if the field is left blank. This field allows ventilation to be stopped if the temperature outside is too warm and could potentially heat the space. For example, if the user specifies a delta temperature of 2°C, ventilation is assumed to be available if the outside air temperature is at least 2°C cooler than the zone air temperature. If the outside air dry-bulb temperature is less than 2°C cooler than the indoor dry-bulb temperature, then ventilation is automatically turned off.

The values for this field can include negative numbers. This allows ventilation to occur even if the outdoor temperature is above the indoor temperature. The Delta Temperature is used in the code in the following way:

IF ((IndoorTemp - OutdoorTemp) &lt; DeltaTemperature) Then ventilation is not allowed.

Thus, if a large negative number is input for DeltaTemperature, the ventilation can be kept on even if the outdoor temperature is greater than the indoor temperature. This is useful for uncontrolled natural ventilation (open windows) or as a way to estimate the effect of required ventilation air for load calculations.

#### Field: Delta Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the temperature difference (in Celsius) between the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperatures below which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature difference value in the schedule can be -100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Delta Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the delta temperature values specified in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Delta Temperature field.

#### Field: Minimum Outdoor Temperature

This is the outdoor temperature (in Celsius) below which ventilation is shut off. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the maximum value is 100.0°C. The default value is           -100.0°C if the field is left blank. This lower temperature limit is intended to avoid overcooling a space, which could result in a heating load.

#### Field: Minimum Outdoor Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the minimum outdoor temperature (in Celsius) below which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature value in the schedule can be -100°C and the maximum value can be 100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Minimum Outdoor Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the temperature values in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Minimum Outdoor Temperature field.

#### Field: Maximum Outdoor Temperature

This is the outdoor temperature (in Celsius) above which ventilation is shut off. The minimum value for this field is -100.0°C and the maximum value is 100.0°C. The default value is 100.0°C if the field is left blank. This upper temperature limit is intended to avoid overheating a space, which could result in a cooling load.

#### Field: Maximum Outdoor Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule (ref. Schedule objects) which contains the minimum outdoor temperature (in Celsius) above which ventilation is shutoff as a function of time. The minimum temperature value in the schedule can be -100°C and the maximum value can be 100°C. This field is an optional field and has the same functionality as the Maximum Outdoor Temperature field. If the user enters a valid schedule name, the temperature values in this schedule will override the constant value specified in the Maximum Outdoor Temperature field.

#### Field: Maximum Wind Speed

This is the wind speed (m/s) above which ventilation is shut off. This can help simulate conditions where one would normally close windows to avoid chaos in a space (papers blowing around, etc.).

These outputs are the total volume and volume flow rate of ventilation air based on the standard density of air.  Standard density in EnergyPlus corresponds to 20ºC drybulb, dry air, and nominally adjusted for elevation.

#### Zone Ventilation Mass [kg]

This output is the total mass flow into a particular zone from outdoors.

The fan electrical consumption for Intake or Exhaust ventilation types (for ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate objects only).

#### Zone Ventilation Air Inlet Temperature [C]

This is equal to the outdoor air temperature except when INTAKE fan power is included (for ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate objects only). When intake fan power is used, then the additional heat due to the fan is added to the outdoor temperature and this will be reported as the inlet air temperature. If multiple ventilation objects are specified for a particular zone, the reported value is the mass flow weighted temperature for the multiple ventilation objects specified for this zone.

### ZoneAirBalance:OutdoorAir

This model calculates a combined zone outdoor airflow by including interactions between mechanical ventilation, infiltration and duct leakage. It is mainly applied to a single zone (e.g., residential) building. The model combines all outdoor airflows from ZoneInfiltration and ZoneVentilation objects in the same zone. This object also includes the induced outdoor airflows due to unbalanced duct leakage, and unbalanced outdoor airflows introduced by unbalanced airflows from ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator objects when the exhaust airflow is greater than the supply outdoor airflow. This model is intended for simplified outdoor airflow calculations as opposed to the more detailed outdoor airflow investigations that can be performed with the AirflowNetwork model. The equation used to calculate the combined zone outdoor airflow is:

<div>\[Q = \sqrt {{Q_n}^2 + {Q_{u,v}}^2 + {Q_{u,l}}^2}  + {Q_{b,v}}\]</div>

where,

*Q*    = Combined outdoor airflow with infiltration, balanced and unbalanced outdoor air flows, and unbalanced duct leakage [m<sup>3</sup>/s]

*Q<sub>n</sub>*   = Natural infiltration airflow from ZoneInfiltration:\* objects [m<sup>3</sup>/s]

*Q<sub>b,v</sub>* = Balanced ventilation airflow, excluding infiltration [m<sup>3</sup>/s]

*Q<sub>u,v</sub>* = Unbalanced ventilation airflow, excluding infiltration [m<sup>3</sup>/s]

*Q<sub>u,l</sub>*  = Unbalanced duct leakage: the difference between supply and return leaks [m<sup>3</sup>/s]

This object cannot be used simultaneously with the EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork model.  If the AirflowNetwork model is active for a simulation time step, the Air Balance Method is reset to “None” for that time step. More advanced outdoor airflow calculations are possible using the EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork model.

This object does not combine any airflows from Fan:ZoneExhaust objects and is independent of HVAC equipment operation.

This object will not work with the AvailabilityManager:HybridVentilation object in the same zone, when the Simple Airflow Control Type Schedule Name is provided in the HybridVentilation object. For this case, the Air Balance Method is reset to “None”.

#### Field: Name

#### Field: Zone Name

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) and attaches a combined outdoor airflow statement to a thermal zone in the building.

#### Field: Air Balance Method

This choice field determines the air balance method. Two choices are Quadrature and None. If Quadrature, the combined zone outdoor air flow is calculated based on the above equation. If None, no combining of outdoor air will be performed (i.e., any ZoneInfiltration:\* and ZoneVentilation:\* objects specified for this zone are simulated individually).

#### Field: Induced Outdoor Air Due to Unbalanced Duct Leakage

This is the induced outdoor airflow rate, in m<sup>3</sup>/s, due to unbalanced duct leakage. If left blank, the default value is 0.

#### Field: Induced Outdoor Air Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) which modifies the induced outdoor airflow rate value (see previous field). The schedule values must be any positive number between 0 and 1 as a fraction. The actual induced outdoor airflow rate in a zone for a particular simulation time step is defined as the product of the Induced Outdoor Air Due to Unbalanced Duct Leakage input field and the value specified by the schedule named in this input field.

Note: Since this object is independent of HVAC operation, the inputs for the last two fields should be carefully selected to match HVAC system operation schedules.

### ZoneMixing

In EnergyPlus, the ZoneMixing syntax is intended to allow simplified treatment of air exchange between zones. Note that this statement only affects the energy balance of the “receiving” zone and that this statement will not produce any effect on the “source” zone. Mixing statements can be complementary and include multiple zones, but the balancing of flows between zones is left to the user’s discretion. The use of the Cross Mixing syntax (ref: Cross Mixing) can allow for automatic balancing of flows and energy flow rates between zones but is hindered by the limitation of only a single cross mixing statement per zone. The use of Refrigeration Door Mixing syntax (ref: Refrigeration Door Mixing) automatically balances the flow and energy between two zones and allows multiple mixing statements per zone. More advanced mixing calculations are possible using the EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork model for multi-zone airflow with or without HVAC system operation. Mixing is entered using the following syntax.

#### Field: Name

### ZoneCrossMixing

The ZoneCrossMixing syntax is ideally suited for two zones that exchange an equal amount of air between each other and do not have any air exchange with other zones. As with Mixing (ref: Mixing), this is a simplified view of interzone airflow in EnergyPlus. The main difference between Mixing and Cross Mixing is that Cross Mixing has an energy effect on both the source and the receiving zone, thus maintaining both the air mass and energy balances in the two zones.

Cross Mixing can be entered once, in one of the mixing zones; or twice, once for each zone. The object should be entered once if Delta Temperature &gt; 0.0 and it is desirable to have mixing only when the source zone  is warmer than the receiving zone. This might be the case when the warmer zone is below the colder zone and the mixing is buoyancy driven. If the zones are next to each other, separated by an open doorway, it would be more suitable to input a cross mixing object for each zone. Then mixing would occur if the zone temperatures differed by Delta Temperature or greater regardless of which is the warmer zone.

If Delta Temperature = 0.0, Cross Mixing can be entered either once or twice: the effect is exactly the same.

Cross Mixing is entered using the following syntax.

#### Field: Name

If the heat transfer is negative, the heat transfer is considered to be a zone mixing sensible heat loss. If the heat transfer is positive, the heat transfer is considered to be a zone mixing sensible heat gain.

#### Zone Mixing Latent Heat Loss Energy [J]

#### Zone Mixing Latent Heat Gain Energy [J]

The latent heat transfer due tothe sum of mixing, cross-mixing, and refrigeration-door mixing in the host (receiving) zone is the sum of all the incoming air mass flow rates multiplied by the elapsed time, the heat of vaporization (calculated for the average conditions (temperature and humidity) between the “source” and “receiving” zones)and the humidity ratio differences between the host zone and corresponding source zones.

### ZoneRefrigerationDoorMixing

The ZoneRefrigerationDoorMixing syntax is ideally suited for two zones, at least one of which is refrigerated, that exchange an equal amount of dry air. They may also have mixed air from other zones, but only one object should be entered for any one pair of zones. As with Mixing (ref: Mixing), this is a simplified view of interzone airflow in EnergyPlus. The ZoneRefrigerationDoorMixing approach shares some features of both Mixing and Cross Mixing. Like Cross Mixing, RefrigerationDoorMixing has an energy effect on both the source and the receiving zone, thus maintaining both the air mass and energy balances in the two zones. Like Mixing, the refrigerated zone can exchange air with multiple zones.  Unlike either of the other two mixing objects, the RefrigeratedDoorMixing always calculates the air exchange based on the zone temperature and relative humidity. That is, the user does not specify the air flow rate. The user can moderate the flow through a door-opening schedule.

Unlike, Cross Mixing, Refrigeration Door Mixing can only be entered once for any unique pair of zones. It doesn’t matter which zone is listed first and the zones will automatically switch back and forth between source and receiving zones depending upon which zone is colder.

Refrigeration Door Mixing is entered using the following syntax.

#### Field: Name

### ZoneEarthtube (Earth Tube)

An earth tube is a long, underground metal or plastic pipe through which air is drawn. During cooling season, as air travels through the pipe, it gives up some of its heat to the surrounding soil and enters the room as cooler air. Similarly, during heating season, as air travels through the pipe, it receives some of its heat from the soil and enters the room as warmer air. Simple earth tubes in EnergyPlus can be controlled by a schedule and through the specification of minimum, maximum, and delta temperatures as described below. As with infiltration and ventilation, the actual flow rate of air through the earth tube can be modified by the temperature difference between the inside and outside environment and the wind speed. The basic equation used to calculate air flow rate of earth tube in EnergyPlus is:

<div>\[EarthTubeFlowRate = \left( {{E_{design}}} \right)\left( {{F_{schedule}}} \right)\left[ {A + B\left| {{T_{zone}} - {T_{odb}}} \right| + C\left( {WindSpeed} \right) + D\left( {WindSpee{d^2}} \right)} \right]\]</div>

For the simulation of the earth tube, a weather data file is required and, therefore, the earth tube cannot run without weather data file. The required input fields to simulate the earth tube include the average soil surface temperature, the amplitude of soil surface temperature, and the phase constant of soil surface temperature. These fields should be calculated in advance by using a separate stand-alone program (CalcSoilSurfTemp) and should be input into earth tube.

#### CalcSoilSurfTemp – Auxiliary Programs Document

The CalcSoilSurfTemp program is simple and requires only two input fields : soil condition and soil surface condition in addition to a valid weather file. For soil condition, the user should select the number corresponding to the actual condition of the soil surrounding the earth tube from the four following options: 1. HEAVY AND SATURATED, 2. HEAVY AND DAMP, 3. HEAVY AND DRY and 4. LIGHT AND DRY. This determines the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of the surrounding soil. For soil surface conditions, the user should select the number corresponding to the actual condition of the ground surface above the earth tube from the eight following options: 1. BARE AND WET, 2. BARE AND MOIST, 3. BARE AND ARID, 4. BARE AND DRY, 5. COVERED AND WET, 6. COVERED AND MOIST, 7. COVERED AND ARID and 8. COVERED AND DRY. This determines the absorption coefficient and the fraction of evaporation rate of the ground surface.

From this information and an analysis of the weather for the location selected, the CalcSoilSurfTemp program (ref. Auxiliary Programs document) calculates the three parameters listed above. The user must then add these parameters as input into EnergyPlus. The full input description of an earth tube in EnergyPlus is given below.

#### Field: Zone Name

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) and attaches a particular earth tube statement to a thermal zone in the building.

#### Field: Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that modifies the maximum design volume flow rate parameter (see next field). This fraction between 0.0 and 1.0 is noted as F<sub>schedule</sub> in the above equation.

#### Field: Design Flow Rate

This number (noted as E<sub>design</sub> in the above equation) is the maximum amount of air mass flow rate of the earth tube expected at design conditions. The flow rate is expressed in units of m<sup>3</sup>/s. The design value is modified by the schedule fraction (see previous field) and user specified coefficients (see last four fields).

#### Field: Minimum Zone Temperature when Cooling

This is the indoor temperature (in Celsius) below which the earth tube is shut off. This lower temperature limit is intended to avoid overcooling a space and thus result in a heating load. For example, if the user specifies a minimum temperature of 20°C, earth tube is assumed to be available if the zone air temperature is above 20°C. If the zone air temperature drops below 20°C, then earth tube is automatically turned off.

#### Field: Maximum Zone Temperature when Heating

This is the indoor temperature (in Celsius) above which the earth tube is shut off. This higher temperature limit is intended to avoid overheating a space and thus result in a cooling load. For example, if the user specifies a maximum temperature of 20°C, earth tube is assumed to be available if the zone air temperature is below 20°C. If the zone air temperature rises above 20°C, then earth tube is automatically turned off.

#### Field: Delta Temperature

This is the temperature difference (in Celsius) between the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperatures below which the earth tube is shut off. This is to allow the earth tube to be stopped either if the temperature outside is too warm and could potentially heat the space or if the temperature outside is too cold and could potentially cool the space. For example, if the user specifies a delta temperature of 2°C, earth tube is assumed to be available if the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor temperature is at least 2°C. If the outside air dry-bulb temperature is less than 2°C cooler or warmer than the indoor dry-bulb temperature, then the earth tube is automatically turned off.

#### Field: Earthtube Type

This alpha character string defines the type of earth tube as one of the following options: Natural, Exhaust, or Intake. A natural earth tube is assumed to be air movement/exchange that will not consume any fan energy or is the result of natural air flow through the tube and into the building. Values for fan pressure and efficiency for a natural flow earth tube are ignored. For either EXHAUST or Intake, values for fan pressure and efficiency define the fan electric consumption. For Natural and Exhaustearth tubes, the conditions of the air entering the space are assumed to be equivalent to the air which is cooled or heated by passing along the pipe. For Intake earth tubes, an appropriate amount of fan heat is added to the air stream.

#### Field: Fan Pressure Rise

This is the pressure rise experienced across the fan in Pascals (N/m<sup>2</sup>). This is a function of the fan and plays a role in determining the amount of energy consumed by the fan.

#### Field: Fan Total Efficiency

This is the total fan efficiency (a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0). This is a function of the fan and plays a role in determining the amount of energy consumed by the fan.

#### Field: Pipe Radius

This is the radius of the earth tube/pipe (in meters). This plays a role in determining the amount of heat transferred from the surrounding soil to the air passing along the pipe. If the pipe has non-circular cross section, user can use the concept of hydraulic diameter as follows.

<div>\[D = 4 \times Area/Perimeter\]</div>

However, since this field requires the pipe radius, hydraulic diameter should be divided by two.

#### Field: Pipe Thickness

This is the thickness of the pipe wall (in meters). This plays a role in determining the amount of heat transferred from the surrounding soil to the air passing along the pipe.

#### Field: Pipe Length

This is the total length of the pipe (in meters). This plays a role in determining the amount of heat transferred from the surrounding soil to the air passing along the pipe. As the length of the pipe becomes longer, the amount of the heat transfer becomes larger.

#### Field: Pipe Thermal Conductivity

This is the thermal conductivity of the pipe (in W/m°C). This plays a role in determining the amount of heat transferred from the surrounding soil to the air passing along the pipe.

#### Field: Pipe Depth Under Ground Surface

This is the depth of the pipe under the ground surface (in meters). This plays a role in determining the temperature of the soil surrounding the pipe.

#### Field: Soil Condition

This alpha character string defines the actual condition of the soil surrounding the earth tube and can be one of any of the following options: HeavyAndSaturated, HeavyAndDamp, HeavyAndDry or LightAndDry. This determines the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of the surrounding soil, which play a role in determining the amount of heat transferred from the surrounding soil to the air passing along the pipe.

#### Field: Average Soil Surface Temperature

This is the annual average soil surface temperature straight above the earth tube, which plays a role in determining the temperature of the soil surrounding the pipe. This field should be calculated in advance using the separate CalcSoilSurfTemp program.

#### Field: Amplitude of Soil Surface Temperature

This is the amplitude of soil surface temperature above the earth tube, which plays a role in determining the temperature of the soil surrounding the pipe. This is the difference between the maximum and minimum soil surface temperature for the whole year divided by two. This field should be calculated in advance using the separate CalcSoilSurfTemp program.

#### Field: Phase Constant of Soil Surface Temperature

This is the phase constant of the soil surface temperature straight above the earth tube, which play a role in determining the temperature of the soil surrounding the pipe at particular time. This is the time elapsed from the beginning of the year until the soil surface temperature reaches the minimum value of the year. This field should be calculated in advance using the separate CalcSoilSurfTemp program.

#### Field: Constant Term Flow Coefficient

This number is the “A” parameter in the above earth tube equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter, however, is a constant under all conditions and is not modified by any environmental effect. As a result, it is dimensionless.

#### Field: Temperature Term Flow Coefficient

This number is the “B” parameter in the above earth tube equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by the temperature difference between the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperatures. The units for this parameter are inverse Celsius.

#### Field: Velocity Term Flow Coefficient

This number is the “C” parameter in the above earth tube equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by the speed of wind being experienced outside the building. The units for this parameter are s/m.

#### Field: Velocity Squared Term Flow Coefficient

This number is the “D” parameter in the above earth tube equation. It is part of the user specified modifying parameters that are a function of environmental factors. This parameter is modified by square of the speed of wind being experienced outside the building. The units for this parameter are s<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>.

### ZoneCoolTower:Shower

A cooltower (which is sometimes referred to as a wind tower or a shower cooling tower) is a component that is intended to model a passive downdraught evaporative cooling (PDEC) that is designed to capture the wind at the top of a tower and cool the outside air using water evaporation before delivering it to a space.  The air flow in these systems is natural as the evaporation process increases the density of the air causing it to fall through the tower and into the space without the aid of a fan.  A cooltower typically consists of a water spray or an evaporative pad, a shaft, and a water tank or reservoir.  Wind catchers to improve the wind-driven performance at the top of the tower are optional.  Water is pumped over an evaporative device by water pump which is the only component consumed power for this system.  This water cools and humidifies incoming air and then the cool, dense air naturally falls down through shaft and leaves through large openings at the bottom of cooltowers.

The shower cooling tower can be controlled by a schedule and the specification of maximum water flow rate and volume flow rate as well as minimum indoor temperature.  The actual flow rate of water and air can be controlled as users specify the fractions of water loss and flow schedule.  The required input fields include effective tower height and exit area to obtain the temperature and flow rate of the air exiting the tower.  A schedule and rated power for the water pump are also required to determine the power consumed. The component typically has a stand alone water system that is not added to the water consumption from mains. However, users are required to specify the water source through an optional field, the name of water supply storage tank, in case any water comes from a water main. The model is described more fully in the Engineering Reference document.

This model requires weather information obtained from either design day or weather file specifications.  The control is accomplished by either specifying the water flow rate or obtaining the velocity at the outlet with inputs and weather conditions when the water flow rate is unknown.  As with infiltration, ventilation, and earth tubes, the component is treated in a similar fashion to “natural ventilation” in EnergyPlus.

#### Field: Name

This field is a unique user assigned name for each cooltower.  Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name.

#### Field: Availability Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule that denotes whether the cooltower can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the cooltower is available and can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the cooltower is not available and must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Zone Name

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) and attaches a particular cooltower statement to a thermal zone in the building.

#### Field: Water Supply Storage Tank Name

This field is optional.  It is used to describe where the cooltower obtains water used for evaporative cooling.  If blank or omitted, then the cooltower will obtain water directly from local water main.  If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the cooltower will obtain its water from that tank.  If a tank is specified, the cooltower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank.  However, if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooltower needs, then the cooltower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as ‘Starved’ water).

#### Field: Flow Control Type

This field specifies how the user wishes to control the cooltower.  The air flow from the cooltower may be controlled by either the water flow rate along with the water pump schedule or naturally driven by wind flow.  The user must select from the following options: **WaterFlowSchedule** and **WindDrivenFlow**.  If the user either wishes to control the water flow rate or has information about the water flow rate, **WaterFlowSchedule** must be selected.  **WindDrivenFlow** for cooltower flow control must be selected when the water flow rate is unknown and the user wishes to have the flow rate of both air and water controlled by the external weather conditions (wind speed).  If the user does not select a control type, **WindDrivenFlow** is assumed as a flow control type.

#### Field: Pump Flow Rate Schedule Name

This field modifies the maximum flow rate of water through the cooltower in m3/sec. This input is “optional.” If the user does not enter a schedule, the flow rate through the cooltower is assumed to be constant during all hours that it is operating based on the value entered in the previous input field. Note that the values for this schedule must be between zero and one.

#### Field: Maximum Water Flow Rate

This field is the maximum water flow rate distributed to the tower in m3/s. This limit is intended to avoid over estimation of water flow rate, which leads higher air flow rate and exit temperature of the air. 

#### Field: Effective Tower Height

This field is the effective tower height for evaporative cooling, from the water spray to the top of the exit in m.

#### Field: Airflow Outlet Area

This field is the area at the exit of the tower in m2.  This field is used to determine the air flow rate leaving the tower with the velocity of the air flow.

#### Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate

This field is the maximum volumetric flow rate of the air leaving the tower in m3/s.  This airflow maximum allows the cooltower performance to be limited if the outside wind speed and the tower height are relatively high and thus result in high airflow supplied to the space.

#### Field: Minimum Indoor Temperature

This field is the minimum indoor temperature in Celsius below which cooltower is shutoff.  This lower temperature limit is intended to avoid overcooling a space and thus result in a heating load.  For example, if the user specifies a minimum temperature of 20°C, cooltower is assumed to be available if the zone air temperature is above 20°C.  If the zone air temperature drops below 20°C, then cooltower is automatically turned off.

#### Field: Fraction of Water Loss

This field specifies the fraction of the loss of water during either operation or transient operation. If the user does not enter a fraction, no loss of water is assumed and the cooltower water consumption includes only evaporation.  Note that the fraction must be between zero and one.

#### Field: Fraction of Flow Schedule

This field specifies the fraction of the airflow that actually goes to the outside.  The user who wishes to control the actual flow to the inside of the building must specify the value of the fraction.  If the user does not enter a fraction, the calculated flow rate is the “zone cooltower volume flow rate.”  Note that the fraction must be between zero and one.

#### Field: Rated Power Consumption

This field is the pump’s rated power consumption in Watts.

### ZoneThermalChimney (Thermal Chimney)

A thermal chimney is a vertical shaft utilizing solar radiation to enhance the natural ventilation in buildings. It consists of a absorber wall, air gap and glass cover with high solar transmissivity. For the high solar absorption, it is usually south facing.

The key output parameter in the thermal chimney model is the enhanced amount of natural ventilation rate caused by the presence of a thermal chimney. In order to determine the enhanced ventilation, the discharge air temperature from a thermal chimney should be calculated, which, in turn, should be computed based on the information on the absorber wall temperature, glass cover temperature and the vertical air temperature distribution within the thermal chimney. Among them, energy balances for the absorber wall and the glass cover are carried out using the existing algorithm currently available in EnergyPlus, which has the similar approach to the Trombe wall. As stated in the Trombe wall object as well, this approach allows the flexibility for users to specify the various wall parameters and to explore unusual configurations. On the other hand, the vertical air temperature distribution and the resultant discharge air temperature of the thermal chimney are computed using the separate thermal chimney algorithm described in the Engineering Reference document.

Similar to the Trombe wall model, a zone is coupled to the desired surface via an interzone partition. To simulate the thermal chimney, the Solar Distribution field in the Building object should be set to FullInteriorAndExterior so that the majority of the solar flux is directed on the absorber wall. For a normal sized thermal chimney zone, the user can set the Zone Inside Convection Algorithm to “Detailed”, which takes into account natural convection effects intended for a normal zone. For a narrow cavity zone having high aspect ratios, there is no built-in algorithm for calculating the correct convection coefficients on the inside of thermal chimney zone walls. One option is to use the “Detailed” convection algorithm similar to the Trombe wall model. However, some error may be incurred when used with a narrow zone. Another option is to use the SurfaceProperty:ConvectionCoefficients object to schedule coefficients that have been determined beforehand by the user. In addition, the wall construction of the adjoining zone must be the mirror image of the wall construction in the thermal chimney zone.

The full input description of a thermal chimney in EnergyPlus is given below.

#### Field: Name

This field is a unique user assigned name for an instance of the thermal chimney system.

#### Field: Zone Name

This field is the name of the thermal chimney zone (ref: Zone). Since the thermal chimney is not only a system component but also a zone itself, this field is also necessary. It should be differentiated from the *Zone name* field described later.

#### Field: Availability Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the thermal chimney can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the system is available and can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the system is not available and must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Width of the Absorber Wall

This number is the width of the absorber wall in the thermal chimney.  The width is expressed in units of m. Even though this value is specified in Surface objects as well, this value is used to compute the discharge air temperature and the enhanced ventilation rate caused by the thermal chimney.

#### Field: Cross Sectional Area of Air Channel Outlet

This number is the cross sectional area of air channel outlet. The area is expressed in units of m<sup>2</sup>. The enhanced air flow rate by the thermal chimney is dependent on cross sectional areas of air channel inlet and outlet. Cross sectional areas of air channel inlet will be described later in conjunction with the distance from the top of thermal chimney to each inlet and relative ratios of air flow rates passing through each inlet.

#### Field: Discharge Coefficient

This dimensionless number is the discharge coefficient of the thermal chimney. The ventilation rate enhanced by the thermal chimney is also dependent on the discharge coefficient.

#### Field: Zone &lt;\#&gt; Name

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) to which the thermal chimney is attached. It is used in conjunction with the next three fields. Note that up to 20 sets of zone name, distance from the top of the thermal chimney to each inlet, relative ratios of air flow rates passing through each zone and cross sectional areas of each air channel inlet may be entered for a single thermal chimney if multiple zones share the common thermal chimney.

#### Field: Distance from Top of Thermal Chimney to Inlet &lt;\#&gt;

This field is the distance from the top of the thermal chimney to each inlet corresponding to each zone. It is used in conjunction with the zone name, relative ratios of air flow rates passing through each zone and cross sectional areas of each air channel inlet. The distance is expressed in units of m. The air flow rate enhanced by the thermal chimney is dependent on the distance between the thermal chimney outlet and inlet.

#### Field: Relative Ratios of Air Flow Rates Passing through Zone &lt;\#&gt;

This dimensionless number is the relative ratio of air flow rates enhanced by the thermal chimney passing through each zone. The total air flow rate enhanced by the thermal chimney is distributed to each zone based on this number if multiple zones share the common thermal chimney. It is used in conjunction with the zone name, the distance from the top of the thermal chimney to each inlet and cross sectional areas of each air channel inlet. Note that the sum of all ratios must be equal to 1.0.

#### Field: Cross Sectional Areas of Air Channel Inlet &lt;\#&gt;

This field is the cross sectional areas of each air channel inlet corresponding to each zone. It is used in conjunction with the zone name, the distance from the top of the thermal chimney to each inlet and relative ratios of air flow rates passing through each zone. The area is expressed in units of m<sup>2</sup>. The air flow rate enhanced by the thermal chimney is dependent on cross sectional areas of air channel inlet and outlet.

### ZoneAirMassFlowConservation

This global object allows users to trigger the zone air mass flow conservation calculation when desired. This object has three input fields; the first choice input field allows the user whether to adjust mixing flows to enforce the zone air mass flow conservation; and the other fields allows the user to specify how infiltration object mass flow rate is calculated for zone air mass flow balance calculation.  If adjustments for either mixing or infiltration is specified then the zone air mass balance attempts to enforce conservation. If both mixing and infiltration adjustments are off, then the zone air mass flow calculation uses the default method which does not include zone mixing objects and assumes self-balanced simple infiltration. The default method may not necessarily enforce zone air mass flow conservation unless the user has specified a balanced flow to begin with. The zone air mass flow conservation primarily accounts for the zonemixing objects air flow in the zone air flow mass balance calculation. In addition to the zonemixing object flow, the procedure accounts for zone supply, exhaust, and return flows and adjusts infiltration air flows (up or down) when required in order to balance the zone air mass flow.  Mixing and infiltration adjustments will only be made in zones which have zonemixing or infiltration objects defined in the input. For example, if a zone does not have any infiltration objects, then no infiltration adjustment will be made for that zone.

First, the ZoneMixing object mass flow rate is adjusted or modified in order to balance zone air mass flow while assuming any zone infiltration objects are self-balanced. This step will always results in balanced zone air mass for receiving zones of ZoneMixing object but it may not necessarily result in a balanced air mass flow for source zones.  

Second, infiltration flow rates are adjusted accoring to the options set. Infiltration flow will be increased or decreased to balance the net flow from supply, exhaust, mixing, and return air flows. If a negative infiltration rate (exfiltration) is required to balance a zone's airflow, then the infiltration rate will be set to zero. This can happen, for example, if the total supply flow exceeds the total exahust plus return flow. 

This object is optional. If it is not present in the input file, the default zone air mass flow calculastion are used which do not account for zonemixing and infiltration flows.



#### Field: Adjust Zone Mixing For Zone Air Mass Flow Balance

This field has two choices: *Yes* or *No*.  When set to *Yes*, the zone air mass flow balance attempts to enforce conservation by adjusting zone mixing flow rates. When set to *No*, mixing flow rates are not adjusted; the mixing flows specified in ZoneMixing obects will be used.  The default is *No*.

#### Field: Infiltration Balancing Method

This field has three choices: *AddInfiltrationFlow*, *AdjustInfiltrationFlow*, or *None*. The default is *AddInfiltrationFlow*. With all three options, the base infiltration flow rate is the flow specified in all Infiltration:\* objects for a given zone.

*AddInfiltrationFlow*: The base infiltration flow may be increased in order to balance the zone air mass flow.  This additional infiltration air mass flow is not self-balanced, i.e., it is always assumed to be incoming flow which leaves by exahust, mixing, or return. If no infiltration air is required in order to balance the zone air mass flow, then the additional infiltration air mass flow rate is set to zero. For this option, the base infiltration flow is always assumed to be self-balanced (i.e., exfiltration = infiltration) and is not included in the zone air mass flow balance.

*AdjustInfiltrationFlow*: The base infiltration flow may be increased or decreased in order to balance the zone air mass flow. If no infiltration is required to balance the zone air flow, then the base infiltration flow rate is retained and assumed to be self-balanced (i.e., exfiltration = infiltration). If the required infiltration flow rate is negative (exfiltration), then the infiltration flow rate is set to zero and surplus flow in the zone is assumed to leave as exfiltration.

*None*: The base infiltration flow is always assumed to be self-balanced (i.e., exfiltration = infiltration) and is not included in the zone air mass flow balance. No changes are made to the base infiltration flow rate.

#### Field: Infiltration Balancing Zones
This field allows user to choose which zones are included in infiltration balancing. There are two choices: *MixingSourceZoneOnly* or *AllZones*.

*MixingSourceZonesOnly*: Infiltration balancing is active only in zones which are source zones for mixing and which have a base infiltration object defined.

*AllZones*: Infiltration balance is active in any zone which has a base infiltration object defined.

### ZoneAirMassFlowConservation Outputs

Current ZoneAirMassFlowConservation output variables (only applicable variables will be generated):

* HVAC, Average, Zone Air Mass Balance Supply Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

* HVAC, Average, Zone Air Mass Balance Exhaust Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

* HVAC, Average, Zone Air Mass Balance Return Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

* HVAC, Average, Zone Air Mass Balance Mixing Receiving Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

* HVAC, Average, Zone Air Mass Balance Mixing Source Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

* HVAC, Average, Zone Infiltration Air Mass Flow Balance Status, []

* HVAC, Average, Zone Mass Balance Infiltration Air Mass Flow Rate, [kg/s]

#### Zone Air Mass Balance Supply Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This output variable represents the total supply air mass flow rate of a zone. The value is determined by summing the supply air mass flow rates contributions from all supply air inlet nodes of a zone.

#### Zone Air Mass Balance Exhaust Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This output variable represents the total exhaust air mass flow rate of a zone. The value is determined by summing the exhaust air mass flow rates contributions from all exhaust air nodes of a zone.

#### Zone Air Mass Balance Return Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This output variable represents the total return air mass flow rate of a zone. The value is determined by summing the return air mass flow rates contributions from return air nodes of a zone.

#### Zone Air Mass Balance Mixing Receiving Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This output variable represents the total zone mixing air mass flow rate of a receiving zone from one or more mixing objects. The value is determined by summing the air mass flow contributions from all zone mixing objects connected to a single receiving zone.

#### Zone Air Mass Balance Mixing Source Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This output variable represents the total zone mixing source air mass flow rate of a source zone feeding one or more mixing objects. The value is determined by summing the air mass flow contributions from all zone mixing objects connected to a single source zone.

#### Zone Air Mass Balance Infiltration Status []

This output variable indicates the status of the infiltration object mass flow rate use for balancing the zone mass flow at each time step. It has values of either **0** or **1**.  If the value of this report variable is **0** then the zone infiltration object mass flow rate is not used in the zone mass conservation calculation, hence the infiltration rate calculated based on the user specified inputs is manintained and the infiltration rate is assumed as self-balanced for the current timestep.  If the value is 1 then the zone infiltration object mass flow rate is included in the zone air mass flow balance calculation, hence the user specified infiltration rate is modified and it is considered as incoming flow to the zone, i.e., self-balanced assumption is not valid for this zone and current time step.

#### Zone Air Mass Balance Infiltration Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This output variable represents the zone infiltration air mass flow rate in kg/s.  This output variable is reported only for source zones and when the zone air mass flow balance is active.  Its value depends on the Infiltration Balancing Method specified.  When the infiltration method is *AddInfiltrationFlow* this output represents the additional infiltration air mass flow rate added on top of the base infiltration air flow in order to balance the zone air mass flow. In this case, the base infiltration air mass flow calculated using the user specified input is assumed self-balanced.  When the infiltration method is *AdjustInfiltrationFlow* and the value of "Zone Air Mass Balance Infiltration Status" is **1**, this output represents the infiltration air mass flow rate required to balance the zone air mass flow. This value could be negative if the zone supply exceeds all other outflows. If the value of "Zone Air Mass Balance Infiltration Status" is **0**, then this output is the self-balanced base infiltration flow rate for current timestep.

### Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing

#### Overview

In order for EnergyPlus to successfully calculate zone design heating and cooling loads and air flow rates and for the program to use these results to automatically size the HVAC components a number of input objects must be present and certain object input fields must be entered.

- The input file should contain a SimulationControl object. The 1<sup>st</sup> field *Do Zone Sizing Calculation* should be entered as *Yes*. This will cause a zone sizing simulation to be done using all the sizing periods in the input file as weather. If there are no air or water loops in the HVAC input fields 2 and 3 can be set to *No.* If there are one or more air loops (i.e., there is at least one AirLoopHVAC object in the input file) then the 2<sup>nd</sup> field *Do System Sizing Calculation* should be entered as *Yes*. If there are one or more water loops (Plant Loop objects) then the 3<sup>rd</sup> field *Do Plant Sizing Calculation* should be set to *Yes*. Finally either the 4<sup>th</sup> field (*Run Simulation for Sizing Periods*) or the 5<sup>th</sup> field (*Run Simulation for Weather File Run Periods*) should be set to *Yes* in order to autosize the components and do a real simulation using the autosized components. The component autosizing calculations are done on the first pass through the HVAC system in the real simulation.

- There must be at least 2 (up to any number) SizingPeriod objects present. Normally one will be for summer conditions and one for winter. The summer day should normally have the field *Day Type* set to *SummerDesignDay*. The winter design day should normally have *Day Type* set to *WinterDesignDay*.

- To apply a global sizing factor include the Sizing:Parameters object.

- For each controlled zone in the input file there should be a corresponding Sizing:Zone object. Similarly for each AirLoopHVAC there should be a Sizing:System object. And for each Plant or Condenser Loop there should be a Sizing:Plant object. Note however that if a controlled zone has no corresponding Zone Sizing object the data from the first Zone Sizing object will be used. Thus if all the zone sizing information is the same only one Zone Sizing object need be entered.

- Only controlled zones are included in the zone and system sizing calculations. Thus for a design air flow rate to be calculated for a zone, it must contain a thermostat *even though it might not need or have a thermostat in the full simulation*. An illustration would be a three zone building with a packaged single zone system and a thermostat in one of the zones. In order for the two slave zones to be included in the design air flow calculations they must be treated as if they have a thermostat: there must be a ZoneControl:Thermostat for each of the slave zones.

- Some attention should be paid to schedules. In a weekly schedule object the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> day schedules are for summer and winter design days respectively. This means that if a SizingPeriod object has field *Day Type* set to *SummerDesignDay*  the day schedule for summer sizing periods will be in effect. Similarly if a SizingPeriod object has field *Day Type* set to *WinterDesignDay*  the day schedule for winter sizing periods will be in effect. Some possible applications of this capability are:

1)   setting internal loads (lights, equipment, occupancy) to maximum all day for cooling and to zero all day for heating;

2)   setting heating and cooling thermostat set points to constant values (no set up or set back);

3)   setting heating and cooling equipment to be always on.

None of these applications are necessarily recommended but these and other uses of the special summer/winter design day schedules may prove useful for specific situations.

- Other than zone thermostat setpoints, the sizing calculations generally know nothing about the system control inputs such as setpoints and availability schedules. The user must coordinate sizing inputs with the actual simulation control inputs.

- The sizing calculations only recognize the presence of central heating and cooling coils, preheat and precool coils and reheat coils. These are assumed to deliver the various supply temperatures specified in the Sizing:System and Sizing:Zone objects. The impact of other components such as heat recovery, dehumidifiers, and pumps are not accounted for in the sizing calculations. Central supply and return fan temperature rise is taken into account in sizing the central cooling coils.

#### Component Autosizing

For autosizing to occur at the component level the user must enter the special value *autosize* in the numeric fields for which autosizing is available. Those fields can be found by looking at the Energy+.idd data dictionary file or under individual object details in this document. Fields that can be autosized are denoted with the comment *\\autosizable*. The components and fields that are autosizable are listed in the following table. Note that spaces may be inserted in object names to facilitate readability.

There are 3 places in the input where the user can impose sizing factors.

1.    In Sizing Parameters (object: Sizing:Parameters), the user can specify an over-all sizing factor. This factor is applied to all the zone design loads and air flow rates resulting from the zone sizing calculations.

2.    In Zone Sizing (object: Sizing:Zone), the user can specify a sizing factor for a specific zone. The factor is applied to the calculated zone design loads and air flow rates for the zone named in the Sizing:Zone object. This sizing factor overrides the global sizing factor. That is, a zone sizing factor, if specified, replaces the global sizing factor for the named zone.

3.    For some plant components (basically all central chillers, boilers and cooling towers) the user can specify a sizing factor that modifies the autosized component capacity and flow rates. These factors are applied after the application of global or zone sizing factors. They are primarily used to split the design load between multiple components. These sizing factors can change the autosizing of the associated loops and pumps. The following rules are followed the effect of plant component sizing factors on loops and pumps.

a.    For supply side branches, the sizing factors of all components in series on the branch are summed and the result becomes the branch sizing factor. If there is a branch pump its autosized design flow rate is multiplied by the branch sizing factor.

b.   For each loop, if the average of the branch sizing factors is less than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the sum of the branch sizing factors. If the average is greater than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the maximum of the branch sizing factors. The loop sizing factor is applied to the loop design flow rate (if autosized) and to the loop pump flow rate (if autosized).

#### Mixing User-Specified and Autosized Inputs

Mixed user-specified and autosized inputs can be successfully used if the following points and suggestions are followed.

1.    Each component is autosized independently. Thus user input for a flow rate in one component will have no effect on other components’ autosized flow rates. For instance, specifying the chilled water loop pump’s rated flow rate will have no effect on the autosizing of the chiller’s design evaporator flow rate or on the plant loop’s autosized maximum loop flow rate.

2.    Within a component it is best to autosize all inputs are enter specified values for all inputs. For example, in a chiller, if only the nominal capaciity is user-specified, the autosized chilled water flow rate may not be consistent with the specified capacity.

3.    Sizing information flows only from the sizing objects to the components. The sizing calculations have no knowledge of user-specified values in a component. The only exception to this rule is that plant loop sizing will collect all component design water flow rates whether autosized or user-specified.

4.    If the user wants to specify a zone or system air flow rate it should be done using the Sizing:Zone and Sizing:System  objects rather than done in the individual components.

5.    The plant loop flow rates are sized from the total design demand of the components connected to each loop. The components demanding water need not be autosized for the plant loop autosizing to work successfully. So the user could specify all the air side components and autosize all the plant loops and plant components. Or specify the chilled water loop flow rate, chilled water pump inputs and chiller inputs and let the condenser loop and tower autosize.

#### Component Sizing Output

The results of the component autosizing calculations are reported on the *eplusout.eio* file. For each component field that has been autosized the object type, object name, field description with unit, and value are printed out as comma separated data on a line beginning with *Component Sizing*. Examples of this are shown in the Output Details and Examples document.

The complete list of objects that have autosized fields is shown in the following table. Note that spaces may be inserted in object names to facilitate readability.

#### User or External Zone Design Flow Rate Inputs

In EnergyPlus the autosizing calculations start with a calculation of the zone design air flow rates using zone by zone design day simulations. The resulting zone design air flow rates and daily air flow sequences are used in the subsequent HVAC and central plant air and fluid flow design calculations and in the component autosizing calculations. The user can override or change the calculated zone design air flow rates in several ways.

1)    The user can enter a value for *Sizing Factor* in the *Sizing:Parameters* object (see description below).

2)    The user can specify a zone level *Zone Sizing Factor* in each *Sizing:Zone* object.

3)    For each zone the user can input a *Cooling Design Air Flow Rate* and/or a *Heating Design Air Flow Rate* (and specify *Cooling Design Air Flow Method = Flow/Zone* and *Heating Design Air Flow Method = Flow/Zone*). These user inputs override the calculated values. The program divides the user input cooling or heating design air flow rate by the calculated values and uses the result as a zone sizing factor to multiply all the elements in the design heating and cooling air flow and load sequences. From this point the design calculations proceed as usual.

#### User or External System Design Flow Rate Inputs

Using the results of the zone design air flow rate calculation (including any user input or altered flow rates) EnergyPlus proceeds to calculate central air system flow rates and cooling and heating loads. The results of this calculation can be overridden in the following way.

For each system (AirLoopHVAC), in the corresponding Sizing:System object, specify *Cooling Design Air Flow Method* to be *Flow/System* and input a value for *Cooling Design Air Flow Rate*. Similarly for heating specify *Heating Design Air Flow Method* to be *Flow/System* and input a value for *Heating Design Air Flow Rate*.

### DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir

This object allows for the outdoor air requirements to be defined in a common location for use by other objects. This object may be referenced by name from other objects (e.g., VAV terminal units) as required to identify an outdoor air quantity for use by that object. Note that a zone name Is not included as an input to this zone outdoor air definition and the number of people in a zone, zone floor area, and zone volume can only be determined after this object has been referenced by another. A single zone outdoor air definition may be referenced by multiple objects to specify that the same outdoor air requirements are used by those objects *or* multiple zone outdoor air objects may be defined and referenced by other objects as needed. If multiple zone outdoor air definitions are used, each outdoor air definition must have a unique name.

#### Field: Name

Unique identifying name. Any reference to this name by other objects will denote that the following outdoor air requirements will be used.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Method

The input must be either *Flow/Person*, *Flow/Area*, *Flow/Zone, AirChanges/Hour*, *Sum*, or *Maximum*. *Flow/Person* means the program will use the input from the field *Outdoor Air Flow per Person* and the actual zone occupancy to calculate a zone outdoor air flow rate. *Flow/Area* means that the program will use the input from the field *Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area* and the actual zone floor area as the zone outdoor air flow rate. *Flow/Zone* means that the program will use the input of the field *Outdoor Air Flow per Zone* as the zone outdoor air flow rate. *AirChanges/Hour* means that the program will use the input from the field *Air Changes per Hour* and the actual zone volume (divided by 3600 seconds per hour) as the zone outdoor air flow rate. *Sum* means that the flows calculated from the fields *Outdoor Air Flow per Person,* *Outdoor Air Flow per Area, Outdoor Air Flow per Zone*, and *Air Changes per Hour* (using the associated conversions to m<sup>3</sup>/s for each field) will be added to obtain the zone outdoor air flow rate. *Maximum* means that the maximum flow derived from *Outdoor Air Flow per Person,* *Outdoor Air Flow per Area, Outdoor Air Flow per Zone,* and *Air Changes per Hour* (using the associated conversions to m<sup>3</sup>/s for each field) will be used as the zone outdoor air flow rate. The default is *Flow/Person*.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Person

The design outdoor air volume flow rate per person for this zone in cubic meters per second per person. The default is 0.00944 (20 cfm per person). An outdoor air flow rate is calculated based on the total number of people for all People statements assigned to the zone. Occupancy schedule values *are not* applied during sizing calculations and *are* applied during the remainder of the simulation. This input is used if *Outdoor Air Method* is one of *Outdoor Air Flow per Person*, *Sum*, or *Maximum*.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area

The design outdoor air volume flow rate per square meter of floor area (units are m<sup>3</sup>/s-m<sup>2</sup>). This input is used if *Outdoor Air Method* is *Flow/Area, Sum* or *Maximum*. The default value for this field is 0.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Zone

The design outdoor air flow rate for this zone in cubic meters per second. This input field is used if *Outdoor Air Method* is *Flow/Zone, Sum* or *Maximum*. The default value for this field is 0.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow Changes per Hour

The design outdoor air volume flow rate in air changes per hour. This factor is used along with the Zone Volume and converted to cubic meters per second. This input field is used if *Outdoor Air Method* is *AirChanges/Hour, Sum* or *Maximum*. The default value for this field is 0.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Flow Rate Fraction Schedule Name

This field is the name of schedule that defines how outdoor air requirements change over time.  The field is optional.  If used, then the schedule values are multiplied by the outdoor air flow rate defined by the previous fields.  The schedule values must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.

### DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution

This object is used to describe the air distribution effectiveness and fraction of secondary recirculation air (return air not directly mixed with outdoor air) of a zone. It is referenced by the Sizing:Zone and Controller:MechanicalVentilation objects.

#### Field: Name

The unique user assigned name for an instance of this object. Any other object referencing this object will use this name.

#### Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness in Cooling Mode

The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in cooling mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values.

#### Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness in Heating Mode

The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in heating mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values as follows:

![](media/image133.svg)

Figure 71. Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness (Source: ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010)

#### Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness Schedule Name

This optional field input points to a schedule with values of zone air distribution effectiveness. It provides a more flexible way of specifying zone air distribution effectiveness if it changes with time and/or system operating status and controls. If the schedule is specified, the zone air distribution effectiveness in cooling mode and heating mode will be ignored.

#### Field: Zone Secondary Recirculation Fraction

The non-negative numeric input for this field is the fraction of a zone’s recirculation air that does not directly mix with the outdoor air. The zone secondary recirculation fraction Er is determined by the designer based on system configuration. For plenum return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with plenum return) Er is usually less than 1.0, although values may range from 0.1 to 1.2 depending upon the location of the ventilation zone relative to other zones and the air handler. For ducted return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with ducted return), Er is typically 0.0, while for those with system-level recirculation (e.g, dual-fan dual-duct systems with ducted return) Er is typically 1.0. For other system types, Er is typically 0.75. Minimum is 0.0, and default is 0.0 for single-path systems (also to maintain backward compatibility). For parallel fan-powered VAV systems, the secondary ventilation path only functions (Er &gt; 0.0) when the fans in the VAV boxes operate, which is during heating. The local ventilation path and the benefits of secondary recirculation disappear during cooling, when the local parallel fans are off (Er = 0.0).

An example of this in an IDF context is shown:

### Sizing:Parameters

This object allows the user to specify global heating and cooling sizing ratios. These ratios will be applied at the zone level to all of the zone heating and cooling loads and air flow rates. These new loads and air flow rates are then used to calculate the system level flow rates and capacities and are used in all component sizing calculations.

The user can also specify the width (in load timesteps) of a moving average window which can be used to smooth the calculated zone design flow sequences. The use of this parameter is described below.

#### Field: Heating Sizing Factor

The global heating sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design heating loads and air flow rates.

#### Field: Cooling Sizing Factor

The global cooling sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design cooling loads and air flow rates

#### Field: Timesteps in Averaging Window

The number of load timesteps in the zone design flow sequence averaging window. The default is 1, in which case the calculated zone design flow rates are averaged over the load timestep.

The zone design air flow rate calculation is performed assuming a potentially infinite supply of heating or cooling air at a fixed temperature. Thus the calculated design air flow rate will always be able to meet any load or change in load no matter how large or abrupt. In reality air flow rates are limited by duct sizes and fan capacities. The idealized zone design flow calculation may result in unrealistically large flow rates, especially if the user is performing the sizing calculations using thermostat schedules with night setup or setback. The calculated zone design flow rates are always averaged over the load timestep. The user may want to perform a broader average to mitigate the effect of thermostat setup and setback and prevent the warm up or cool down flow rates from dominating the design flow rate calculation.. Specifying the width of the averaging window allows the user to do this.

For example, if the load calculation timestep is 15 minutes and the user specifies the *Timesteps in Averaging Window* to be 4, the zone design air flows will be averaged over a time period of 1 hour. Specifying 8 would result in averaging over a 2 hour period.

### Sizing Parameters Outputs

The sizing factors and the averaging window size are reported out on the *eplusout.eio* file. An example is:

```
! <Load Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation Averaging Window>, Value
 Timesteps in Averaging Window,    1

```

### OutputControl:Sizing:Style

As described early in the document (see: EnergyPlus Output Processing), the user may select the “style” for the sizing result files (epluszsz.&lt;ext&gt;, eplusssz.&lt;ext&gt;). This object applies to all sizing output files.

```idd
OutputControl:Sizing:Style,
       \memo default style for the Sizing output files is comma -- this works well for
       \memo importing into spreadsheet programs such as Excel(tm) but not so well for word
       \memo processing progams -- there tab may be a better choice.  fixed puts spaces between
       \memo the "columns"
       \unique-object
   A1; \field Column Separator
       \required-field
       \type choice
       \key Comma
       \key Tab
       \key Fixed
```


#### Field: Column Separator

For this field, the desired separator for columns is entered. “Comma” creates comma separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus&lt;sizing type&gt;.csv files are created). “Tab” creates tab separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus&lt;sizing type&gt;.tab files are created). “Fixed” creates space separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus&lt;sizing type&gt;.txt files are created) but these are not necessarily lined up for easy printing.

Note that both tab and comma separated files easily import into Excel™ or other spreadsheet programs. The tab delimited files can also be viewed by text editors, word processing programs and easily converted to “tables” within those programs.

### Sizing:Zone

The Sizing:Zone object provides the data needed to perform a zone design air flow calculation for a single zone. This calculation assumes a variable amount of supply air at a fixed temperature and humidity. The information needed consists of the zone inlet supply air conditions: temperature and humidity ratio for heating and cooling. The calculation is done for every design day included in the input. The maximum cooling load and air flow and the maximum heating load and air flow are then saved for the system level design calculations and for the component automatic sizing calculations.

The Sizing:Zone object is also the place where the user can specify the design outdoor air flow rate by referencing the name of a design specification outdoor air object. This can be specified in a number of ways (ref. DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir).This data is saved for use in the system sizing calculation or for sizing zone components that use outdoor air.

The user can also place limits on the heating and design cooling air flow rates. See * Heating Design Air Flow Method* and *Cooling Design Air Flow Method* below and the explanations of the various heating and cooling flow input fields.

The user can ask the zone design calculation to take into account the effect of a Dedicated Outdoor Air System on the zone design loads and airflow rates. The design calculation will calculate the heat addition rate to the zone of an idealized SOA system and add or subtract the result from the total zone loads and flow rates.

The default is .002032, corresponding to .40 cfm/ft<sup>2</sup>. If the maximum heating design flow rate calculated using these input fields is greater than the design heating flow rate calculated during sizing, these input fields have no impact on sizing. It may be more appropriate to select only one of these three fields to calculate the maximum heating design flow rate (i.e., if one ore more of these three fields is 0, it will not be used in calculating the maximum heating design flow rate).

### Zone Sizing Outputs

The zone design air flow rates and loads are output onto the local file “epluszsz.&lt;ext&gt;” where &lt;ext&gt; is the extension from the sizing style object (default is csv – a comma separated file *epluszsz.csv)*. The columns are clearly labeled. It will easily import into Excel or other spreadsheet program that accepts delimited files. All of these values are design air flow rates and loads *calculated by the program*. No sizing factors have been applied.

The calculated zone design air flow rates and the user input or altered zone design air flow rates are also reported on the *eplusout.eio* file. The values are printed out for each zone as comma separated records beginning with *Zone Sizing*. Items output on the *eio* file are: zone name, load type (heating or cooling), design load, calculated design air flow rate, user design air flow rate, design day name, time of peak, outside temperature at peak, outside humidity ratio at peak.

### DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing

This object is used to describe general sizing and scalable sizing methods which are referenced by zone HVAC equipment objects. It is optional input field in zone HVAC objects. If a name of this optional input is not specified or is blank then the sizing method or input specified in the parent object is used.  If the name of this object is entered, then the values or method specified overrides the sizing method in the parent zone HVAC objects. This object is meant to provide scalable sizing method to users. The name of this object is an optional input field in the zoneHVAC objects. When this name in not specified in the zone HVAC object the sizing method or the value specified in the zone HVAC object will be used.

List of zoneHVAC objects than can reference this object include:

* ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow

* ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner

* ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump

* ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump

* ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner

* ZoneHVAC:UnitHeater

* ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator

* ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil

* ZoneHVAC:VentilatedSlab

* ZoneHVAC:EvaporativeCoolerUnit

* ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem

The sizing methods input fields available in this objects are for supply air flow and capacity for heating and cooling operating modes. Some zone HVAC equipment has single supply air flow rate input field that serves both cooling and heating operating modes.  So entering either of the cooling or heating scalable sizing input field is sufficient.  When there are separate input fields for cooling, heating, no-cooling, and no-heating operating modes, the corresponding input fields are specified.  The child components supply air flow rate are also sized using scalable sizing methods specified in the parent objects. The methods allow users to enter a fixed or hard sized values, autosizable, or scalable sizing methods.  Methods allowed for sizing supply air flow rates include: *SupplyAirFlowRate*, *FractionOfAutosizedCoolingAirflow*, *FractionOfAutosizedHeatingAirflow*, *FlowPerFloorArea, FlowPerCoolingCapacity*, and *FlowPerHeatingCapacity*.  The different sizing options are defined as follows:

* **SupplyAirFlowRate**: entered when it is intended that the user specified either hard value or the simulation engine autosize the supply air flow rates for cooling, heating, and no-cooling or no-heating operating modes.

* **FlowPerFloorArea**: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determine the supply air flow rates from the user specified *supply air flow rates per unit floor area* and the zone floor area of the zone served by the zone HVAC equipment.

* **FractionOfAutosizedCoolingAirflow**: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified *flow fraction* and *autosized cooling design supply air flow rate*.

* **FractionOfAutosizedHeatingAirflow**: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified *flow fraction* and *autosized heating design supply air flow rate*.

* **FlowPerCoolingCapacity**: entered when it is intended t that he simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified *supply air flow per cooling capacity value* and *autosized cooling design capacity*.

* **FlowPerHeatingCapacity**: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified *supply air flow per heating capacity value* and *autosized heating design capacity*.

The  Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing object also has input fields for sizing or scalable sizing of cooling and heating capacity. However, most of the parent zone HVAC objects do not have input fields for sizing capacities. So, the capacity scalable sizing fields in the parent objects are used for sizing child components capacity sizings.  The scalable capacity sizing may be indirectly impacted by the scalable supply air flow rates sizing values. Moreover, the autosized cold water, hot water and steam flow rates in the parent zone HVAC objects (e.g. FanCoils, UnitHeaters, UnitVentilators, and VentilatedSlabs) and capacity in child components are determined using the scalable sizing methods.  Sizing methods allowed for cooling and heating capacity include: *CoolingDesignCapacity, HeatingDesignCapacity*, *CapacityPerFloorArea, FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity*, *FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity*.

* **CoolingDesignCapacity**: entered when it is intended that user specifies either a hard sized cooling capacity value or the simulation engine autosizes cooling capacity value for the cooling design capacity.

* **HeatingDesignCapacity**: entered when it is intended that user specifies either a hard sized heating capacity value or the simulation engine autosized heating capacity value for the heating design capacity.

* **CapacityPerFloorArea**: is entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the cooling or heating capacity from user specified capacity per floor area value and the floor area of the zone served by the zone HVAC equipment.

* **FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity**: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine sizes the cooling capacity from the user specified *capacity fraction* and *autosized cooling design capacity* value.

* **FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity**: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine sizes the heating capacity from the user specified *capacity fraction* and *autosized heating design capacity* value.

### Sizing:System

The Sizing:System object contains the input needed to perform a central forced air system design air flow, heating capacity, and cooling capacity calculation for a system serving one or more zones. The information needed consists of the outside environmental conditions and the design supply air temperatures, outdoor air flow rate, and minimum system air flow ratio.

The outside conditions come from the design days in the input. A system sizing calculation is performed for every design day in the input file and the resulting maximum heating and cooling air flow rates and capacities are saved for use in the component sizing calculations.

Supply air conditions are specified by inputting a supply air temperature for cooling, a supply air temperature for heating, and a preheat temperature.

The system sizing calculation sums the zone design air flow rates to obtain a system supply air flow rate. The design conditions and the outdoor air flow rate are used to calculate a design mixed air temperature. The temperature plus the design supply air temperatures allows the calculation of system design heating and cooling capacities.

#### Field: AirLoop Name

The name of the AirLoopHVAC corresponding to this Sizing:System object. This is the air system for which the design calculation will be made using the input data of this Sizing:System Object.

#### Field: Type of Load to Size On

The user specified type of load on which to size the central system. The choices are *Sensible*, *Total* and *VentilationRequirement*.  *Sensible* and *Total* mean that the central system supply air flow rate will be determined by combining the zone design air flow rates, which have been calculated to meet the zone sensible loads from the design days. *VentilationRequirement* means that the central system supply air flow rate will be determined by the system ventilation requirement.  In addition *Sensible* tells the program to size the central cooling coil using entering air flow rate and air conditions at the sensible load peak; *Total* indicates that the program should size  the central cooling coil at the air flow rate and conditions at the total load peak. The central heating coil is always sized at the conditions at the peak sensible heating load.

#### Field: Design Outdoor Air Flow Rate

The design outdoor air flow rate in cubic meters per second. Generally this should be the minimum outdoor air flow. It is used for both heating and cooling design calculations. The assumption for cooling is that any outdoor air economizer will be closed. If *Autosize* is input the outdoor air flow rate will be taken from the sum of the zone outdoor air flow rates or calculated based on the System Outdoor Air Method selection (field below).

#### Field: Central Heating Maximum System Air Flow Ratio

The ratio of the maximum system air flow rate for heating to the maximum system air flow rate.  The value must be between 0 and 1. For constant volume systems the ratio should be set to 1. This ratio should be set to reflect what the user expects the system flow rate to be when maximum heating demand occurs. This ratio is used in calculating the central system heating capacity. Thus if the system is VAV with the zone VAV dampers held at minimum flow when there is a zone heating demand, this ratio should be set to the minimum flow ratio. If the zone VAV dampers are reverse action and can open to full flow to meet heating demand, this ratio should be set to 1.  The default is set to 0.5, reflecting the fact that VAV dampers are typically not allowed to fully open during heating.

#### Field: Preheat Design Temperature

The design humidity ratio exiting the precooling coil (if any) in kilograms of water per kilogram of dry air. (kgWater/kgDryAir)

#### Field: Central Cooling Design Supply Air Temperature

The design supply air temperature for cooling in degrees Celsius. This should be the temperature of the air exiting the central cooling coil.

#### Field: Central Heating Design Supply Air Temperature

The design supply air temperature for heating in degrees Celsius. This can be either the reset temperature for a single duct system or the actual hot duct supply air temperature for dual duct systems. It should be the temperature at the exit of the main heating coil. This value is also used for the sizing of zone equipment (e.g., reheat coil) for the system embedded with central heating coils, but it is not used if there is no central heating coil in the system.

#### Field: Type of Zone Sum to Use

If the input is *coincident* the central system air flow rate will be sized on the sum of the coincident zone air flow rates. If the input is *noncoincident* the central system air flow rate will be sized on the sum of the noncoincident zone air flow rates. The default is noncoincident.

Default is 1.0 which indicates zones can have 100% outdoor air maintaining backward compatibility. This inputs work for constant volume air systems, single and dual duct VAV systems.

The program calculates the heating capacity from the design autosized cooling capacity and user specified fraction.

#### Field: Central Cooling Capacity Control Method

Specifies how the central cooling coil will be controlled, which affects the coil sizing calculation. There are 4 choices: VAV, Bypass, VT, and OnOff. Choose VAV  if the cooling output is controlled by varying the air flow. Bypass  should be chosen if the capacity is controlled by bypassing a variable fraction of the mixed air around the coil face. VT  indicates that cooling coil output is controlled by varying the coil exit temperature while the flow rate is constant. And OnOff means that the cooling output is controlled by cycling the air flow.

### System Sizing Outputs

The system design air flow rates and heating and cooling capacities are output onto the local file “eplusssz.&lt;ext&gt;” where &lt;ext&gt; is the extension from the sizing style object (default is csv – a comma separated file *eplusssz.csv)*. The columns are clearly labeled. It will easily import into Excel or other spreadsheet program that accepts delimited files. The results are calculated values and do not include any user input system flow rates.

The calculated system design air flow rates and the user input system design air flow rates are also reported on the *eplusout.eio* file. The values are printed out for each system as comma separated records beginning with *System Sizing*. An example is:

```
! <System Sizing Information>c++, System Name, Field Description, Value
 System Sizing, VAV SYS 1, Calculated Cooling Design Air Flow Rate [m3/s],   1.3194
 System Sizing, VAV SYS 1, User Cooling Design Air Flow Rate [m3/s],   1.5000
 System Sizing, VAV SYS 1, Calculated Heating Design Air Flow Rate [m3/s],  0.90363
 System Sizing, VAV SYS 1, User Heating Design Air Flow Rate [m3/s],   1.0000
```

### Sizing:Plant

The Sizing:Plant object contains the input needed for the program to calculate plant loop flow rates and equipment capacities when autosizing. This information is initially used by components that use water for heating or cooling such as hot or chilled water coils to calculate their maximum water flow rates. These flow rates are then summed for use in calculating the Plant Loop flow rates.

The program will size any number of chilled water, hot water, condenser water and other plant loops. There should be one Sizing:Plant object for each plant loop that is to be autosized.

#### Field: Plant or Condenser Loop Name

The name of a Plant Loop or Condenser Loop object corresponding to this Sizing:Plant object. This is the plant loop for which this data will be used for calculating the loop flow rate.

#### Field: Loop Type

The possible inputs are *Heating, Steam, Cooling,* or *Condenser*.

#### Field: Design Loop Exit Temperature

The water temperature in degrees Celsius at the exit of the supply side of the plant loop, Thus this is the temperature of the water supplied to the inlet of chilled or hot water coils and other equipment that places loads on a plant loop.

#### Field: Loop Design Temperature Difference

The design temperature rise (for cooling or condenser loops) or fall (for heating loops) in degrees Celsius across the demand side of a plant loop.  This temperature difference is used by component models to determine flow rates required to meet design capacities.  Larger values lead to smaller design flow rates.

#### Field: Sizing Option

This field is optional. This field controls how concurrence issues impact the plant loop design flow rate. If it is not used then the program uses noncoincident method, which is the historical behavior prior to version 8.3. There are two choices, noncoincident and coincident. The use of Coincident sizing option requires that the SimulationControl object be set to YES for the input field called Do HVAC Sizing Simulation for Sizing Periods.

#### Field: Zone Timesteps in Averaging Window

This field is optional and is only used if the preceding field is set to Coincident.  This is the number of zone timesteps used in a moving average to determine the design flow rate from HVAC Sizing Simulation approach.  This allows using a broader average over time when using coincident plant sizing.  This is similar in concept to the similar field in Sizing:Parameters which specifies the averaging window for zone loads.  The default is 1. 

#### Field: Coincident Sizing Factor Mode

This field is only used if the sizing option is set to Coincident.  This field controls the behavior of coincident sizing with respect to what, if any, sizing factor should be applied to further modify the flow rate measured while running HVAC Sizing Simulations.  There are four options.  Enter the keword None to use the raw value for flow rate without modification.  Enter the keyword GlobalHeatingSizingFactor to modify the flow by the sizing factor entered in the object called Sizing:Parameters for heating. Enter the keyword GlobalCoolingSizingFactor to modify the flow by the sizing factor entered in the object called Sizing:Parameters for cooling.  Enter the keyword LoopComponentSizingFactor to modify the flow by a sizing factor determined from the combination of component-level sizing factors in the associated plant loop. 

An IDF example:

```idf
Sizing:Plant,
   Chilled Water Loop, ! name of loop
   Cooling,            ! type of loop
   7.22,               ! chilled water supply temperature
   6.67,               ! chilled water delta T
   NonCoincident,      !- Sizing Option
   1,                  !- Zone Timesteps in Averaging Window
   GlobalCoolingSizingFactor; !- Coincident Sizing Factor Mode
```
   
### Plant Sizing Outputs

The loop flow rates are reported on the *eplusout.eio* file along with the component sizing results.

When coincident plant sizing method is used, the eio file contains special summary report with various details and interim values from the calculations, under the following record header:  ! <Plant Sizing Coincident Flow Algorithm>, Plant Loop Name, Sizing Pass {#}, Measured Mass Flow{kg/s}, Measured Demand {W}, Demand Calculated Mass Flow{kg/s}, Sizes Changed {Yes/No}, Previous Volume Flow Rate {m3/s}, New Volume Flow Rate {m3/s}, Demand Check Applied {Yes/No}, Sizing Factor {}, Normalized Change {}, Specific Heat{}.

HVAC: Primary and Secondary Systems
-----------------------------------

The HVAC and equipment section of the EnergyPlus input data dictionary and input data file are slightly more complex than the description of building geometry, internal gains, etc. because of the interconnections of the various parts of an HVAC system. In EnergyPlus, there are several portions to the HVAC simulation. All of these parts must be correctly specified in order to arrive at a valid simulation model. The goal of this section is to provide interface developers and advanced users with guidelines on what input is expected and also provide some background on basic EnergyPlus simulation methodology.

An EnergyPlus HVAC simulation consists of various components that are connected physically in the actual system by ducts, piping, etc. Every component in an HVAC system must have an inlet and outlet “node”. In the actual system, a node might be a point in the system at which fluid properties can be measured. In an EnergyPlus simulation, the nodes are points at which fluid properties are evaluated and passed on to subsequent equipment.

Components are linked together to form various loops within the simulation. Thus, the output node from one component also serves as the inlet node to the next component. Loops are constructed by defining these loops and also defining the components on the loops. The figure below shows a generic example of the loop-node concept.

Loop nodes are a key defining feature in EnergyPlus. As a result, it is recommended that one of the first steps taken in defining an HVAC system in EnergyPlus be the definition of a node diagram or map. This is helpful for visualization of the entire system. Such a map could be created electronically within an interface or could be kept in the background out of the sight of the user.

![](media/image134.svg)

Figure 72. Example Node Diagram

So that these loops are manageable and more clearly defined both in the input and in the simulation, four different loop sections can be defined in an EnergyPlus input file. In general, these four types are in essence two pairs of loop sections that make up  two distinct types of loops: a zone/air loop and a plant loop. As of Version 7, plant loops and condenser loops have been consolidated to be largely the same. The four loop section types are defined below.

**Air Loop Supply Side:**  The air loop is defined by the section of the zone/air loop that starts after the zone return streams are combined and continues on until just before any air stream(s) are branched off to individual zones. The starting point of the air loop is fairly straightforward. The ending point is slightly more complex but can be understood with some examples. For instance, in a terminal reheat system, the end of the air loop would typically be considered the node following the cooling coil. In a dual duct system, the air loop would have two ending points that would correspond to the nodes after the cooling coil and after the heating coil/humidifier. In most cases, the air loop has a single starting point and up to two ending points (for a 2 deck system).  An outdoor air subsystem can be included in the supply side for ventilation and relief air.

**Air Loop Zone Equipment:**  The zone equipment section of the input file is defined as more or less the rest of the zone/air loop (outside air is handled separately as a subset of the air loop). This includes everything from where the ducts are split to serve various zones up through where the return ducts from various zones are mixed into a single return duct. Zone equipment can include dampers and reheat coils as well as zone specific conditioning systems such as thermostatic baseboard or a window air conditioner. Most control issues are typically dealt with in the zone equipment section of the simulation.

**Plant Loop Demand Side:**  One side of the plant is where energy is “demanded” by various components that make up the air loop or zone equipment. Typically, this is the water side of equipment such as coils, baseboard, radiant heating and cooling, etc. In the case of a condenser loop, energy is typically “demanded” by a chiller condenser or other water source heat pump. The demand side of this loop can also include mixers, flow splitters, and a bypass.

**Plant Loop Supply Side:**  The other side of the plant loop is where energy is “supplied” by various components. The components typically found on the supply side include pumps, boilers, chillers, purchased heating and cooling, ice storage, etc. In the case of a condenser, the components would be cooling tower, fluid cooler, or ground source heat exchanger, etc.  As with the demand side, this loop can also include mixers, flow splitters, and a bypass.

The section of the input file for describing the HVAC system tends to follow this structure presented above. Both plant and condenser loops are defined with a master description and then branch off into supply and demand side details. Linkage between the two sides is done using node names in the master statement. The air loop and zone equipment descriptions are slightly more complex due to the wide range of potential systems that are anticipated. Note that in every section controls become a key element and must be addressed. Each of the following sections details either a loop, a portion of a loop, or controls.

Group – Node-Branch Management
------------------------------

**Nodes**, **Branch** **Lists** and **Branches** define the topography of the HVAC connections.

### NodeList

For convenience, the NodeList object can be used to identify all the nodes for a particular use. A node list is not always required. The advantage of listing all the nodes in this manner is that input fields in other objects that ask for a node name can refer to either a single node or a list of nodes using this object. .

There are other lines of input syntax that require the use of a NodeList as part of the input. These syntax items include: OutdoorAir:NodeList and the SetpointManager objects. In these two cases, the use of a NodeList statement is mandatory if there is more than one node in this particular “list”. For example, if the outside air only has a single inlet node, then the name of that node can replace the node list name in the input syntax. As a result of this mandatory specification of node lists for certain types of input, nodes can, obviously, and may be members of more than one list.

#### Field: Name

This alpha designation must be unique among all the Node List Names. It is used as reference in various objects (e.g. OutdoorAir:NodeList).

#### Field: Node &lt;\#&gt; Name  (up to 25 allowed)

Each unique Node identifier creates a Node structure with various attributes depending on the type of node. Typical values include Temperature, Mass Flow Rate, and Temperature Set Point. The alpha designators are associated with a particular node.

Though each NodeList is limited to 25 nodes, several node lists may be entered if you choose to identify all the nodes up front. For example:

```
NodeList, Nodes1-25,
NODE_1,NODE_2,NODE_3,NODE_4,NODE_5,NODE_6,NODE_7,NODE_8,NODE_9,NODE_10,
NODE_11,NODE_12,NODE_13,NODE_14,NODE_15,NODE_16,NODE_17,NODE_18,NODE_19,NODE_20,
NODE_21,NODE_22,NODE_23,NODE_24,NODE_25;
NodeList, Nodes26-49,NODE_26,NODE_27,NODE_28,NODE_29,NODE_30,
NODE_31,NODE_32,NODE_33,NODE_34,NODE_35,NODE_36,NODE_37,NODE_38,NODE_39,NODE_40,
NODE_41,NODE_42,NODE_43,NODE_44,NODE_45,NODE_46,NODE_47,NODE_48,NODE_49;
```

**Advanced Node Reporting**

The following system node variables are available when you request “Diagnostics, DisplayAdvancedReportVariable;”. They are normally used for debugging unusual system cases and may not be available for all systems. Also, their definitions may change based on the usage in the system.

#### System Node Minimum Temperature [C]

#### System Node Maximum Temperature [C]

These node variables represent the min/max of loops or branches.

#### System Node Minimum Limit Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

#### System Node Maximum Limit Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

These node variables hold the maximum possible and the minimum allowable flow rates for a particular component. As such, they represent the “hardware limit” on the flow rate for the component. By convention, these variables are stored at the component inlet node. Since components share their nodes (the outlet node of one component is the inlet node of the next component), the protocol must be strictly followed. These variables are set by each component based on the design flow limits of the equipment.

#### System Node Minimum Available Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

#### System Node Maximum Available Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

These node variables represent the *loop* or *branch* maximum and minimum flow rate for the current configuration of the loop on which the component resides. The central plant routines manage these variables dynamically to resolve flow rates through branches located inside splitters and mixers.

#### System Node Setpoint Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

The current mass flow rate setpoint at a system node in kg/s. Some controllers and equipment types sense this single setpoint.

#### System Node Requested Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This output is the current mass flow rate request at a system node in kg/s.  Only used for plant simulations and nodes.  This is the mass flow rate “requested” by a component.  This is a record of what the component wanted which can be useful for diagnostics when the actual simulated flow is different than expected.  This value is also used to determine overall loop flow rates.

#### System Node CO2 Concentration [ppm]

The average carbon dioxide concentration, in parts per million (ppm), at a system node for the timestep being reported.

#### System Node Generic Air Contaminant Concentration [ppm]

The average generic contaminant concentration, in parts per million (ppm), at a system node for the timestep being reported.

### BranchList

A branch list is intended to define the branches or portions of a particular loop that are present on an individual plant or condenser loop. Thus, the BranchList syntax simply provides a list of branch names (see Branch syntax) that then refer to more detailed syntax in another part of the input file. The syntax for describing a list of branches is given below.

Branches in BranchList objects should be listed in flow order: inlet branch, then parallel branches, then outlet branch. Branches (within a splitter/mixer) are simulated in the order listed.

#### Field: Name

A unique name to identify the branch list.

#### Field: Branch &lt;\#&gt; Name

Branch name in the list.  As noted above, Branches in BranchList objects MUST be listed in flow order: inlet branch, then parallel branches, then outlet branch. Branches are simulated in the order listed.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

```idf
BranchList, Cooling Supply Side Branches,
     CW Pump Branch,
     Little Chiller Branch,
     Big Chiller Branch,
     Purchased Cooling Branch,
     Supply Bypass Branch,
     Cooling Supply Outlet;
```

### Branch List Output

No output directly related to Branch Lists current is presented.

### Branch

Branches can be considered the mid-level grouping of items in the EnergyPlus HVAC loop scheme. Components are the lowest level of information. A collection of components in series forms a branch. Every branch must have at least one component, but it may have several components in series. The air loop also has “unitary” objects that are compound objects that wrap components and when they are used it is the unitary objects that appear on the Branch and not the child components.  The **Branch** defines the order that components appear on the branch. Moreover, a collection of branches and their connecting information form a loop. Therefore, a branch is a collection of components while a loop is a collection of branches. Thus, components are specified for particular HVAC loops by assigning them to branches and then connecting those branches together to form a loop.

For hydronic plant systems, the Branch object is used on both the demand side and the supply side of the plant loop.  For HVAC air systems, the Branch object is only used to describe the components on the supply side of an air loop. The demand side of the air loop does not use the Branch object.  The outside air system appears on a Branch object but it does not use a Branch object itself to describe the components that included in the outside air system.  So-called “ZoneHVAC:\*” equipment, HVAC equipment directly associated with a zone, do not use the Branch object.

It should be noted that each component also has at least two nodes associated with it—an inlet node and an outlet node. These nodes, by default, are also part of the branch to which their components are assigned.  Although it may appear redundant to list the node names in both the Branch and in the component object being referenced, this is needed because many components are connected to more than one loop at a time and the node names are needed here to distinguish which portion of the component is being attached to this particular branch and its loop.  It should be noted that each branch must have at least one component on it. A “null” branch such as one where the first component on the loop is in reality a splitter or mixer should be defined as a single Pipe component for plant, or a single Duct component for air systems.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field is the unique, user-defined name that allows the branch to be referenced by other elements such as the PlantLoop and CondenserLoop statements.

#### Field: Maximum Flow Rate

This field is the maximum flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/sec) allowed on a particular branch. This number will set an absolute maximum flow rate for all components on the loop. Even if components are defined with a higher flow rate, EnergyPlus will limit the flow on this particular branch to the value entered here by the user. Currently this is used in the Air Loop and is not a required field in the Plant and Condenser Loop. The example files for the Plant and Condenser Loops leave this field blank to simplify flow input.

#### Field: Pressure Drop Curve Name

This is an optional field used to specify pressure drop information for this particular branch. Currently this is only available in plant/condenser fluid loops: PlantLoop and CondenserLoop. Air loops require a full airflow network, so this field is ignored if found on an air loop. The value entered for this field must match a pressure curve object also found in the input. This curve can be of the type: Curve:Linear, Curve:Quadratic, Curve:Cubic, Curve:Exponent, or Curve:Functional:PressureDrop. In order to then perform a pressure simulation for the loop that this branch is located on, a flag must be set in the loop object. Reference the PlantLoop and CondenserLoop field “Pressure Simulation Type” for allowable settings. See the Engineering Reference document for further information on pressure simulation in plant loops.

#### Field Set (Branch Specifications)

Following the two introductory items, there are groups of 5 repeated items: a type, a name, inlet and outlet node names, and a branch control type. All of these items refer to one particular component on the branch. The first component defined by these items will be the first component on this branch, etc. through the end of the list.  This object is extensible and can use as many field sets as needed.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Object Type

This field is the component object type (object class name). The component type refers to other elements within the input file and specifies what kind of component this is. The objects in the  Group – Plant Equipment section are valid here when the Branch is used in Plant specifications. Fans, coils, unitary systems, and Outside Air Systems are also valid component types for the Branch object. Pipes or Ducts are also valid for this field.  No splitter or mixer type objects are allowed.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Name

The component name is the unique, user-defined reference name to distinguish between potentially multiple occurrences of a particular component type in an input file. The set of component type and component name must be unique. (You can only have 1 Boiler object with name MYBOILER).

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Inlet Node Name

This field references an inlet node name that will be found in the actual component specification.  The inlet node, and the outlet node specified in the next field, should correspond to component model’s connections that are intended for the loop that this Branch is assigned to.  For example a water-cooled chiller will have two inlet nodes, one for chilled water return and one for condenser water return and so the chiller will appear on two Branch objects accordingly.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Outlet Node Name

This field references an outlet node name that will be found in the actual component specification.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Branch Control Type

This field is being deprecated and is no longer used or required. Prior to version 7 it was used by plant to resolve branch flow rates but now this is handled automatically by the program.  The field will be removed in a future version.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

```idf
Branch,
    Air Loop Main Branch,    !- Branch Name
    1.75,                    !- Maximum Branch Flow Rate {m3/s}
    ,                        !- Pressure Drop Curve Name
    AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass,  !- Comp1 Type
    GasHeat CBVAV System,    !- Comp1 Name
    Air Loop Inlet Node,     !- Comp1 Inlet Node Name
    Air Loop Outlet Node,    !- Comp1 Outlet Node Name
    ;                  !- Comp1 Branch Control Type
```


And a more complex one:

```idf
  BRANCH,
    Air Loop Main Branch,    !- Branch Name
    1.3,                     !- Maximum Branch Flow Rate {m3/s}
    ,                        !- Pressure Drop Curve Name
    FAN:SIMPLE:ConstVolume,  !- Comp1 Type
    Supply Fan 1,            !- Comp1 Name
    Air Loop Inlet Node,     !- Comp1 Inlet Node Name
    Cooling Coil Air Inlet Node,  !- Comp1 Outlet Node Name
    ,                  !- Comp1 Branch Control Type
    COIL:Water:DetailedFlatCooling,  !- Comp2 Type
    Detailed Cooling Coil,   !- Comp2 Name
    Cooling Coil Air Inlet Node,  !- Comp2 Inlet Node Name
    Air Loop Outlet Node,    !- Comp2 Outlet Node Name
    ;                 !- Comp2 Branch Control Type
```


### Branch Output

The components on a branch are in series and that list is in simulation and connection order. Each branch must obey the rules: the outlet for component 1 has to have the same node name as the inlet for component 2, and so forth.

Eplusout.err contains the test for “individual branch integrity”:

```
   ************* Testing Individual Branch Integrity
   ************* Testing Branch=AIR LOOP MAIN BRANCH
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch=COOLING DEMAND INLET
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch=COOLING COIL BRANCH
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch=DEMAND BYPASS BRANCH
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch=COOLING DEMAND OUTLET
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch=COOLING SUPPLY OUTLET
   ************* ....passed
```

The addition of pressure simulation for branches in fluid loops brings a new output at the branch level:

* HVAC,Average,Plant Branch Pressure Difference [Pa]

#### Plant Branch Pressure Difference [Pa]

This field allows the user to output the pressure drop of a particular branch on a plant loop or condenser loop. This output is only recognized if a valid pressure simulation is being performed. To do this, the user must specify a pressure simulation type as an input in the PlantLoop or CondenserLoop object.

### ConnectorList

A connector list is a collection of either one or two connection devices (Connector:Mixer or Connector:Splitter). Due to the definition of a loop in EnergyPlus, there is a maximum of one mixer and one splitter allowed for each loop segment. This limitation still allows a tremendous amount of flexibility to the user and can also still be solved within a reasonable amount of time and without a complex solver routine. The connection list simply allows the specification of the types and names of these devices. This allows the main loop statements to have the flexibility to have multiple lists that can have one or more item.

#### Field: Name

This field is an identifying name that will be referenced to main loop statements using this connector list. The name must be unique among connector list names.

#### Field-Set: Connection Object Type and Identifying Name (up to 2 allowed)

Depending on the loop, either one or two of the connectors will be specified. If this particular loop only has a single connector (either Connector:Mixer or Connector:Splitter), then only the first two items (type of connection and identifying name of connector) are included. If both a mixer and splitter are present, the additional type of connection and identifying name must be included. Note that the order that the items appear is inconsequential—either the Connector:Mixer or the Connector:Splitter may appear first. This will not affect the simulation.

#### Field: Connector 1 Object Type

This field contains the connector type **Connector:Mixer** or **Connector:Splitter**.

#### Field: Connector 1 Name

This field is an identifying name for the connector. It will be used by other objects in the input file.

#### Field: Connector 2 Object Type (optional)

This field contains the connector type **Connector:Mixer** or **Connector:Splitter**.

#### Field: Connector 2 Name (optional)

This field is an identifying name for the connector. It will be used by other objects in the input file.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

```idf
ConnectorList LIST, Cooling Supply Side Connectors,
    Connector:Splitter, CW Loop Splitter,
    Connector:Mixer, CW Loop Mixer;
```

### Connector List Outputs

No output directly related to Connector Lists is currently presented.

### Pipe:Adiabatic

In reality, every component is connected to its closest neighbors via a pipe or a duct. At the current time, such detail is not needed in EnergyPlus. Thus, the Pipe:Adiabatic component is currently used more as a connection device (for branches that really do not have any components associated with them) or as a bypass than anything else. As such, its input is very simple and its algorithm is equally simple. The current algorithm for a pipe is simply to pass the inlet conditions to the outlet of the pipe component.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the pipe.

#### Field: Inlet Node Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the pipe inlet node.

### Pipe Outputs

### Pipe:Adiabatic:Steam

To connect the various components in a steam system regardless of it being the condensate or the steam side of the loop steam pipe needs to be used. In reality, every component is connected to its closest neighbors via a pipe or a duct. At the current time, such detail is not needed in EnergyPlus. Thus, the Pipe:Adiabatic:Steam component is currently used more as a connection device (for branches that really do not have any components associated with them). As such, its input is very simple and its algorithm is equally simple. The current algorithm for a pipe is simply to pass the inlet conditions to the outlet of the pipe component.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the steam pipe.

#### Field: Inlet Node Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the steam pipe inlet node.

#### Field: Outlet Node Name

### PipingSystem:Underground Class Objects

Objects in this class are used to simulate the heat transfer processes of a piping system placed underground, which may or may not be in contact with a number of zone surfaces.  There are three related objects, all of which are prefixed with PipingSystem:Underground :

- PipingSystem:Underground:Domain

- PipingSystem:Underground:PipeCircuit

- PipingSystem:Underground:PipeSegment

### PipingSystem:Underground:Domain

This section documents the domain object, which is used to specify information for the overall ground domain, including thermal properties, mesh parameters, and surface interaction.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the ground domain.

#### Field: XMax, YMax, ZMax

These numeric fields are used to specify the overall domain size, in each of the three Cartesian dimensions.  The domain will be meshed from {x, y, z} = {0, 0, 0} to {Xmax, Ymax, Zmax}.

Note that for this object, the x-z plane lies parallel to the ground surface, such that the y-dimension can be thought of as representing the burial depth.  This is in contrast to the way building surface coordinates are defined with the x-y plane lying parallel to the ground.  Also note that any pipe segments that end up being used in a ground domain will be placed axially in the z-dimension.  Thus, pipe flow will always be in either the positive z or negative z direction.

#### Field: X-Direction Mesh Density Parameter

This numeric integer field represents the number of cells to be placed between any two “domain partitions” during mesh development.  A domain partition may be thought of as a basement wall/floor, or a pipe.  Once these components are laid out in the domain, this field number of cells are placed between the partitions.  Further information on this is found in the engineering reference manual.

#### Field: X-Direction Mesh Type

This alpha field represents the type of mesh to create when placing cells between “domain partitions.”  Two options are available: “uniform” and “symmetricgeometric.”  For uniform, the cells are placed in the region with all cells having equal size.  For symmetric-geometric, the cells are compressed toward the partitions so that there are more cells on either side of the mesh region.  This can help focus computational intensity on the boundary areas where it is likely more desired.  For symmetric-geometric mesh distribution, the mesh density parameter should be an even number to provide the symmetric condition.

#### Field: X-Direction Geometric Coefficient

This numeric field represents the compression of cell distribution if the x-direction mesh type is set to “symmetricgeometric.”  If the mesh type is uniform, this field is not interpreted.  For symmetric geometric, a value in this field equal to 1 would result in a uniform distribution, while a value of 2 would provide a highly skewed distribution.

#### Field: Y-Direction Mesh Density Parameter

See Field: X-Direction Mesh Density Parameter.

#### Field: Y-Direction Mesh Type

See Field: X-Direction Mesh Type.

#### Field: Y-Direction Geometric Coefficient

See Field: X-Direction Geometric Coefficient.

#### Field: Z-Direction Mesh Density Parameter

See Field: X-Direction Mesh Density Parameter.

#### Field: Z-Direction Mesh Type

See Field: X-Direction Mesh Type.

#### Field: Z-Direction Geometric Coefficient

See Field: X-Direction Geometric Coefficient.

#### Field: Soil Thermal Conductivity

The thermal conductivity of the soil, in W/m-K.

#### Field: Soil Density

The bulk density of the soil, in kg/m3.

#### Field: Soil Specific Heat

The specific heat of dry soil, in J/kg-K.  If moisture is defined in this object, moisture and freezing effects are accounted for by varying the specific heat value.

#### Field: Soil Moisture Content Volume Fraction

A nominal value of soil moisture content to be used when evaluating soil thermal properties.

#### Field: Soil Moisture Content Volume Fraction at Saturation

A nominal value of soil moisture content when the soil is saturated, this is used in evaluating thermal properties of freezing soil

#### Field: Type of Undisturbed Ground Temperature Object

The type of undisturbed ground temperature object used to determine ground temperature for the farfield boundary conditions.

#### Field: Name of Undisturbed Ground Temperature Object

The name of the undisturbed ground temperature object used to determine ground temperature for the farfield boundary conditions.

#### Field: This Domain Includes Basement Surface Interaction

A yes/no field stating whether zone surfaces should be coupled to this domain.

#### Field: Width of Basement Floor in Ground Domain

If this domain does include basement interaction, this represents the width of the domain cutaway to include the basement.  In essence, this is the width of basement floor to include in the ground simulation.  This width should *include* the basement wall thickness.

#### Field: Width of Basement Floor in Ground Domain

If this domain does include basement interaction, this represents the depth of the domain cutaway to include the basement.  In essence, this is the burial depth of the basement to include in the ground simulation.  This depth should include the basement floor thickness.

#### Field: Shift Pipe X Coordinates By Basement Width

If this domain does include basement interaction, this flag specifies whether the pipe segment X-values should then be shifted by the basement width.  In essence, this specifies the reference point for pipe segment x-values: if NO then the reference is domain x=0, if YES then the reference is the basement width point.

#### Field: Name of Basement Wall Boundary Condition Model

The name of an OtherSideConditions model defined in the input file and referenced by the surfaces which should be included as “wall surfaces” for the basement interaction part of the ground heat transfer model.

#### Field: Name of Basement Wall Boundary Condition Model

The name of an OtherSideConditions model defined in the input file and referenced by the surfaces which should be included as “floor surfaces” for the basement interaction part of the ground heat transfer model.

#### Field: Convergence Criterion for the Outer Cartesian Domain Iteration Loop

The maximum temperature deviation within any cell between one iteration and another to decide that the Cartesian domain has converged to within tolerance.  A smaller value will improve accuracy and computation time.  A smaller value should be accompanied by a higher number of iterations if maximum accuracy is desired.

#### Field: Maximum Iterations in the Outer Cartesian Domain Iteration Loop

The maximum number of iterations to make when performing temperature updates of the Cartesian coordinate system.  The actual number of iterations made will of course depend on transient conditions and convergence tolerance.

#### Field: Evapotranspiration Ground Cover Parameter
Numeric field specifies the ground cover effects used in the evapotranspiration model at the ground surface heat balance. The values range from 0 (solid, nonpermeable ground surface) to 1.5 (wild growth).

#### Field: Number of Pipe Circuits Entered for this Domain

The number of pipe circuit objects which will be defined in the following fields.

#### Field: Pipe Circuit 1 {… to N; extensible}

A PipingSystem:Underground:PipeCircuit to be included in this domain.  This indicates that the pipe circuit and all of the underlying pipe segments will be included during mesh development and heat transfer calculations within this domain.  Any number of pipe circuits can be added, assuming all underlying pipe segments do not cause any conflicts for the mesh development engine (overlapping pipes, etc.).

### PipingSystem:Underground:PipeCircuit

This section documents the pipe circuit object, which is used to specify information for the plant loop topology, such as inlet and outlet connections.  This object also groups together pipe segments to define flow paths within a given pipe circuit.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the pipe circuit.

 The inner diameter of the pipe, in m.

#### Field: Pipe Outer Diameter

 The outer diameter of the pipe, in m.

#### Field: Design Flow Rate

 The “design” flow in this pipe circuit, in m3/s.  This is the flow which this component will request during the simulation.  Of course, other components and overall plant management will decide the flow actually given to this component.

 The inlet node name for this circuit, which is used when placing this circuit on a branch on a plant or condenser loop.

#### Field: Circuit Outlet Node Name

#### Field: Convergence Criterion for the Inner Radial Iteration Loop

 The maximum temperature deviation within any cell between one iteration and another to decide that the radial domain has converged to within tolerance.  A smaller value will improve accuracy and computation time.  A smaller value should be accompanied by a higher number of iterations if maximum accuracy is desired.

#### Field: Maximum Iterations in the Inner Radial Iteration Loop

 The maximum number of iterations to make when performing temperature updates of the radial coordinate system.  The actual number of iterations made will of course depend on transient conditions and convergence tolerance.

#### Field: Number of Soil Nodes in the Inner Radial Near Pipe Mesh Region

#### Field: Pipe Segment 1 {… to N; extensible}

 A PipingSystem:Underground:PipeSegment to be included in this pipe circuit.  The circuit is set up so that flow passes through the *N* segments in the order they are entered here.



### PipingSystem:Underground:PipeSegment

This section documents the pipe segment object, which is used to specify information for a single pipe segment placed at some x, y coordinate in the ground.  The flow direction is also defined in this object to allow for careful description of varying flow paths.  This can be useful for accounting for short circuiting effects if two pipes are placed in counterflow vs. parallel flow.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the pipe segment.

#### Field: X Position

This numeric field represents the x-direction placement of the pipe.  If no basement is included in the simulation, this is measured from x=0.  If a basement is included, and the domain object specifies that pipes should be shifted, this is measured from the basement wall.

#### Field: Y Position

This numeric field represents the burial depth of the pipe, measured from the ground surface.  This will always be a positive number.

#### Field: Flow Direction

This alpha field is used to define the flow direction within this pipe segment.  The choices are “increasing” or “decreasing.”  These can be chosen carefully to encapsulate specific short-circuiting effects due to varying flow configurations (circuiting).

An example of this object in an IDF is offered here for a foundation heat exchanger

### Duct

The Duct object is a component for air systems that is a direct analogue for Pipe:Adiabatic in the fluid loops. It is used when it is necessary (due to the HVAC system configuration) to have a branch that has no functional components. This case most often arises for a bypass branch. Since every branch must have at least one component, the Duct component is used for this situation. The duct is an adiabatic, pass-through component; all of its inlet conditions are passed through unchanged to its outlet.

### PlantLoop

The main elements of the PlantLoop syntax are described in further detail below. A map of how the input for this portion of the HVAC input fits together is provided in the following diagram.

![PlantLoopSyntax (media/image135.png)

Figure 73. Plant Loop Input Syntax Map

#### Field: Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the plant loop.

#### Field: Fluid Type

This alpha field must be a keyword selected from the list of available fluids for an EnergyPlus plant loop. Either **Water**, **Steam** or **UserDefinedFluidType** may be used. If the UserDefinedFluidType keyword is used, the following input field i.e. User Defined Fluid Type must have a value (namely the name of a FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration object).

#### Field: User Defined Fluid Type

This alpha field must be specified when the previous field is set to **UserDefinedFluidType** otherwise it could be left blank. **Water**, **EthyleneGlycol**, **PropoleneGlycol** and **Steam** are all “built-in” fluids for EnergyPlus (that is, all of the appropriate properties are contained within the program). If the fluid specified here is a mixture of water and ethylene or propylene glycol, then only FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration objects need to be specified and the name of the appropriate one is used here. For another water/glycol mixture, a complete set of fluid property data (FluidProperties:Name and FluidProperties:Temperature objects plus multiple FluidProperties:Concentration objects for specific heat, density, etc.) must be specified (Ref dataset: GlycolPropertiesRefData.idf).

#### Field: Plant Equipment Operation Scheme Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the plant operation scheme. This field ties to the PlantEquipmentOperationSchemes input structure, which must also be defined.

#### Field: Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name

This alpha field is used to identify the node which the Loop Manager will access the temperature setpoint that it will try to maintain. This is typically the Plant Loop Supply Side Outlet Node so that it will not interfere with component temperature setpoints. An associated temperature setpoint manager will need to be defined.

#### Field: Maximum Loop Temperature

This numeric field contains the maximum allowable temperature in Celsius for this loop.

#### Field: Minimum Loop Temperature

This numeric field contains the minimum allowable temperature in Celsius for this loop.

#### Field: Maximum Loop Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the maximum loop flow rate in cubic meters per second. This parameter is also used when the user chooses to autocalculate the loop volume. See Volume of the Plant Loop below and the Engineering Manual for more details. This field is autosizable.

#### Field: Minimum Loop Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the minimum loop flow rate in cubic meters per second.

#### Field: Plant Loop Volume

Volume of the plant loop in m<sup>3</sup>. This numeric field contains the loop volume for the entire loop, i.e. both the demand side and the supply side. This is used for the loop capacitance calculation.. Loop volume (m<sup>3</sup>) could be calculated from pipe size data but this is not usually known. If zero volume is specified the loop has no fluid heat capacity. If a very large capacitance is specified unrealistic time delay may result and there may be poor response to changes in loop setpoint temperature. The loop capacitance **autocalculate** option gives reasonable values for most system sizes. This calculation is described in the Engineering Reference manual.

#### Field: Plant Side Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Plant Side Inlet Node.  This node is the inlet to the supply side of the loop.

#### Field: Plant Side Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Plant Side Outlet Node. This node is the outlet of the supply side of the loop.

#### Field: Plant Side Branch List Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Plant Side Branch List. The list referenced here should list all the branches on the supply side of the loop.

#### Field: Plant Side Connector List Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Plant Side Connector List. The list referenced here should list the splitter and mixer on the supply side of the loop.

#### Field: Demand Side Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Inlet Node. This node is the inlet to the demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Demand Side Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Outlet Node. This node is the outlet of the demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Demand Side Branch List Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Branch List. The list referenced here should list all the branches on the demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Demand Side Connector List Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Connector List. The list referenced here should list the splitter and mixer on the demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Load Distribution Scheme

This alpha field contains the Load Distribution Scheme Keyword. The Load Distribution Scheme selects the algorithm used to sequence equipment operation in order to meet the plant loop demand. Currently, five schemes are functional. **Optimal** operates each piece of equipment at its optimal part load ratio and will operate the last component between its minimum and maximum part load ratio in order to meet the loop demand. **SequentialLoad** loads each piece of equipment sequentially in the order specified in the PlantEquipmentList to its maximum part load ratio and will operate the last required piece of equipment between its minimum and maximum part load ratio in order to meet the loop demand. **UniformLoad** evenly distributes the loop demand among all available components on the equipment list for a given load range. **SequentialUniformPLR** loads all equipment on the PlantEquipmentList to a uniform part load ratio (PLR). Components are loaded sequentially based on the order specified in the PlantEquipmentList until each component is fully loaded, at which point the next subsequent component is added and the load is distributed uniformly based on PLR between the components. **UniformPLR** will load all equipment on the PlantEquipmentList to a uniform part load ratio (PLR). No equipment will be loaded below its minimum PLR. If the total load is less than the sum of all equipment on the PlantEquipmentList operating at their respective minimum PLRs, then the last item in the equipment list is dropped and the load is distributed based on a uniform PLR for the remaining plant equipment.

Note: For all schemes, if the load for any individual component is less than the component load at the minimum PLR, the individual component model will false load or reduce duty cycle while operating at the minimum part load ratio until the load is met.

#### Field: Availability Manager List Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the System Availability Manager List.

#### Field: Plant Loop Demand Calculation Scheme

There are two plant loop demand calculations schemes in EnergyPlus. There is a SingleSetpoint and a DualSetpointDeadband; the SingleSetpoint is the default if this field is left blank. In the SingleSetpoint scheme the Plant Loop requires that a Setpoint Manager set a single setpoint value (on Node%TempSetpoint). Examples of this setpoint manager would be: SetpointManager:Scheduled, SetpointManager:OutsideAir, etc. For the DualSetPointDeadband scheme the Plant Loop requires that a Setpoint Manager set the high and low setpoint values (for Node%TempSetPointHi and Node%TempSetPointLo). Examples of this Setpoint manager would be: SetpointManager:Scheduled:DualSetpoint.

The plant loop demand calculation scheme determines the amount of heating or cooling necessary to bring the temperature of the Plant Loop to its setpoint(s). When this value is determined then the load distribution scheme explained in the previous section takes this value and distributes the load to the appropriate equipment. The demand calculation scheme determines how the load is calculated. See more information in the Engineering Document.

#### Field: Common Pipe Simulation

This field specifies a primary-secondary plant loop simulation. When a common pipe option is specified, the plant side of the loop is the primary loop and the demand side of the loop is the secondary loop, and a pump object must be placed on the demand side inlet branch. The three options are “**None**”, “**CommonPipe**” and “**TwoWayCommonPipe**”. “**None**” means that there is no secondary loop and the plant loop is modeled as a single primary loop. “**CommonPipe**” means that the common pipe interface does not attempt any temperature control, it only satisfies secondary (demand side) flow requests. “**TwoWayCommonPipe**” allows control of the secondary (demand side) inlet temperature or the primary (plant side) inlet temperature by placing a setpoint on the corresponding node. If this field is left blank, it will default to ”None”. If the field is set to “None” and the program finds a pump on the demand side it will result in a fatal error.  If the field is set to “CommonPipe” or “TwoWayCommonPipe” and the program does not find a pump on the demand side it will result in a fatal error. The common pipe simulation is currently limited to simulating loop pumps, i.e. each pump should be placed on the inlet branch of the plant side or demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Pressure Simulation Type

This field lets user to choose if this plant loop will be involved in a pressure drop calculation.  This requires that at least one branch on the loop have pressure drop data.  If not, an error will be thrown due to the input mismatch.  Currently there are two pressure drop simulation types: “PumpPowerCorrection” and “LoopFlowCorrection”.  In both of these methods, branch pressure drop data is used to calculate a dynamic loop pressure drop and is used to update pumping power accordingly.  The flow correction method allows the user to enter information regarding the pressure curve of a constant speed pump so that the simulation can dynamically resolve the pressure vs. flow relationship in the plant loop.  This is limited to constant speed pumps, as the variable speed pumps are expected to resolve as if it were controlled by a variable drive, so that they can inherently meet any pressure and flow demand required by the loop.  This is also limited to “loop pumps”, where there is a single pump on the plant loop. Common pipe simulations and “branch pump” simulations are not compatible with this level of pressure simulation.  See the documentation for the Pump:ConstantSpeed in order to determine required inputs for this pressure simulation method to be performed.  In the pressure drop system, parallel flow rates are not resolved (to match the pressure drop for the parallel system).  Enhancements to this calculation are planned which will allow parallel branch flow resolution.  See the Engineering Reference document for more information on how this works.

In the above example input there is no system availability manager specified and the Demand Calculation Scheme will default to SingleSetpoint using a single setpoint manager. Common pipe simulation field in the above example will default to “NONE” since it is not specified.

* HVAC,Average,Plant Supply Side Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]


#### Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate [W]

This is the value of the net demand required to meet the cooling setpoint of the loop.  If the loop setpoint is met for the current HVAC timestep, Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate will equal sum of the total cooling demand from the demand side coils on the loop.  It will also equal the cooling output of all chillers (or other cooling equipment) on the loop less any pump heat added to the fluid.  For example, for a chilled water loop with one chiller and one pump serving one chilled water coil:  Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate will equal the chiller evaporator heat transfer less the pump heat to fluid, and it will also equal the chilled water coil total cooling output.

If the plant loop setpoint is not met, Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate will equal the sum of the total cooling demand from the demand side coils on the loop plus the additional cooling required to bring the loop flow to setpoint.  If the loop remains off setpoint for successive timesteps, the demand required to return to setpoint will repeat in each timestep until the loop reaches setpoint.  For this reason, Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate should not be summed over time, because it will overstate the demand whenever the loop is off setpoint.

#### Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate [W]

This is the value of the net demand required to meet the heating setpoint of the loop.  If the loop setpoint is met for the current HVAC timestep, Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate will equal sum of the total heating demand from the demand side coils on the loop.  It will also equal the heating output of all boilers (or other cooling equipment) on the loop plus any pump heat added to the fluid.  For example, for a hot water loop with one boiler and one pump serving one hot water coil: Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate will equal the boiler heat transfer plus the pump heat to fluid, and it will also equal the hot water coil total heating output.

If the plant loop setpoint is not met, Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate will equal the sum of the total heating demand from the demand side coils on the loop plus the additional heating required to bring the loop flow to setpoint.  If the loop remains off setpoint for successive timesteps, the demand required to return to setpoint will repeat in each timestep until the loop reaches setpoint.  For this reason, Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate should not be summed over time, because it will overstate the demand whenever the loop is off setpoint.

#### Plant Supply Side Inlet Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This is the value of the mass flow rate at the Inlet to Plant Loop on the supply side. There is not an associated Plant Loop outlet node flow rate since continuity must be maintained in the loop and the outlet must be the same.

#### Plant Supply Side Inlet Temperature [C]

This is the value of the temperature at the Inlet to the plant loop on the supply side.

#### Plant Supply Side Outlet Temperature [C]

This is the value of the temperature at the outlet to the plant loop on the supply side.

#### Plant Supply Side Not Distributed Demand Rate [W]

This is the value of the demand that could not be distributed to the plant equipment because of some constraint in the plant operation scheme.  This is a record of the loop operation scheme supervisory controls after attempting to distribute the load.  For example it would be  non-zero in situations where the load is larger than the upper limit of capacities set for the plant equipment controls.  This output is for *before* the equipment has actually been simulated whereas the separate output Plant Supply Side Unmet Demand Rate is for *after* the equipment has simulated.

#### Plant Supply Side Unmet Demand Rate [W]

This is the value of the demand NOT provided by the plant equipment to meet the heating or cooling setpoint of the loop. The value is positive when the plant equipment cannot meet the setpoint, and the value is negative when the plant equipment provides more than enough heating or cooling to meet the setpoint. A negative value can happen when the amount of demand is smaller than the minimum capacity of the equipment using the minimum part load ratio.

#### Plant Solver Sub Iteration Count [ ]

This is the count of iterations that the overall plant simulation used over the period of time being reported.  This high-level output is from the plant solver used for all the plant loops and condenser loops in the model.

#### Plant Solver Half Loop Calls Count

This is the count of calls to model individual half-loops that occurred during the overall plant simulation over the period of time being reported.  This includes all the half-loops for both plant loops and condenser loops.

#### Plant Common Pipe Mass Flow Rate [Kg/s]

This output gives the magnitude of the flow through common pipe. The value is averaged over the reporting interval.

#### Plant Common Pipe Temperature [C]

This output gives the value of the temperature of the fluid flowing through common pipe. This value is averaged over the reporting interval.

#### Plant Common Pipe Flow Direction Status []

This output gives the direction of flow in common pipe. The value is an integer and can be 0, 1 or 2. Since the output value is averaged over reporting interval, a non-integer value may be shown as an output when the reporting interval is not detailed. An output value of 0 means that there was no flow in common pipe. An output value of 1 means that the secondary flow is greater than primary flow, whereas a value of 2 means that primary flow is greater than secondary flow.

#### Plant Common Pipe Primary Mass Flow Rate [Kg/s]

This output variable gives the mass flow in the primary side common pipe leg in a Two-Way common pipe simulation. Value is averaged over the reporting interval.

#### Plant Common Pipe Secondary Mass Flow Rate [Kg/s]

This output variable gives the mass flow in the secondary side common pipe leg in a Two-Way common pipe simulation. Value is averaged over the reporting interval.

#### Primary Side Common Pipe Flow Direction []

This output variable gives the direction of flow in a primary side common pipe leg in a Two-Way Common Pipe Simulation. A value of zero means there was no flow in the pipe. A value of 1 means the flow was from top to bottom in EnergyPlus loop schematic. So for primary side, a value of 1 means the flow is from Primary side inlet to Primary side outlet and a value of 2 means flow is from Primary side outlet to Primary side inlet.

#### Secondary Side Common Pipe Flow Direction []

This output variable gives the direction of flow in a Secondary side common pipe leg in a Two-Way Common Pipe Simulation. A value of zero means there was no flow in the pipe. A value of 1 means the flow was from top to bottom in EnergyPlus loop schematic. So for Secondary side, a value of 1 means the flow is from Secondary side outlet to Secondary side inlet and a value of 2 means flow is from Secondary side inlet to Secondary side outlet. Note that this is opposite to the primary side common pipe.

#### Plant Common Pipe Primary to Secondary Mass Flow Rate [Kg/s]

This output variable gives the mass flow from primary to secondary side in a Two-Way common pipe simulation. Value is averaged over the reporting interval.

#### Plant Common Pipe Secondary to Primary Mass Flow Rate [Kg/s]

This output variable gives the mass flow from secondary to primary side in a Two-Way common pipe simulation. Value is averaged over the reporting interval.

#### Plant System Cycle On Off Status

This field is the availability status of a Plant Loop. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the System Availability Manager(s) listed in a System Availability Manager List. When a single availability manager is used in a System Availability Manager List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref. System Availability Manager Outputs). When multiple availability managers are used in a System Availability Manager List, the loop availability status is determine by the rules associated with Plant Loops (see rules described for Group – System Availability Managers). The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 2.. These integers represent *NoAction* (0), *ForceOff* (1), and *CycleOn* (2). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref. Output:Variable object) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.

#### Plant Demand Side Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

This field allows the user to output the demand side pressure drop of a plant loop.  This output is only recognized if a valid pressure simulation is being performed.  To do this, the user must specify a pressure simulation type as an input in the PlantLoop object, and input at least one pressure drop curve on a branch of the plant loop.  This particular output is only relevant if the user puts that curve on the demand side of the loop.

#### Plant Supply Side Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

This field allows the user to output the supply side pressure drop of a plant loop.  This output is only recognized if a valid pressure simulation is being performed.  To do this, the user must specify a pressure simulation type as an input in the PlantLoop object, and input at least one pressure drop curve on a branch of the plant loop.  This particular output is only relevant if the user puts that curve on the supply side of the loop.

#### Plant Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

This output is the total pressure drop of a plant loop.  This output is only recognized if a valid pressure simulation is being performed.  To do this, the user must specify a pressure simulation type as an input in the PlantLoop object, and input at least one pressure drop curve on a branch of the plant loop.  This particular output is relevant regardless of the location of pressure drop curves: demand side, supply side, or both.



The following advanced output variables are also available for plant loops (and condenser loops) when advanced output variables are requested (e.g. “Output:Diagnostics, DisplayAdvancedReportVariable;”).

* HVAC,Average,Plant Demand Side Lumped Capacitance Temperature [C]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Supply Side Lumped Capacitance Temperature [C]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Component Distributed Demand Rate [W]

#### Plant Demand Side Lumped Capacitance Temperature [C]

#### Plant Supply Side Lumped Capacitance Temperature [C]

These two outputs are the temperature of the plant (or condenser) loop’s working fluid where the two half-loops interface together.  The program models heat capacitance in the volume of fluid inside the plant loop itself using two simple models for “well-stirred” tanks located at each of the half-loop inlet and outlet pairs.  These tank models also receive the heat transferred to the fluid by the work done by pumping and resulting friction heating.  One output is for the point where the fluid leaves the supply side and enters the demand side.  The other output is for the point where the fluid leaves the demand side and enters the supply side.

#### Plant Component Distributed Demand Rate [W]

This output is available for every component on every branch in a plant (or condenser) loop and shows the outcome of the load dispatch performed by the operation schemes.  This the load in watts passed from the supervisor routines to the equipment component models.  This provides a record of what a particular component was asked to do by the supervisory routines. This can be useful for diagnosing issues in operation schemes when a component or loop is failing to meet the load.

### CondenserLoop

The condenser loop input is very similar to that for the plant loop. As of version 7, the two loops are modeled the same way and inside the program all condenser loops are just plant loops. (In future versions of the program, this CondenserLoop object might be deprecated and these loops will be described using the PlantLoop object.)  The main differences are the applicable components and operation schemes. This is depicted in the following diagram.

![CondenserLoopSyntax (media/image136.png)

Figure 74. Condenser Loop Input Syntax Map

#### Field: Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the condenser loop.

#### Field: Fluid Type

This alpha field must be a keyword selected from the list of available fluids for an EnergyPlus plant loop. Either **Water** or **UserDefinedFluidType** may be used. If the UserDefinedFluidType keyword is used, the following input field i.e. User Defined Fluid Type must have a value (namely the name of a FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration object).

#### Field: User Defined Fluid Type

This alpha field must be specified when the previous field is set to **UserDefinedFluidType** otherwise it could be left blank. **Water**, **EthyleneGlycol**, and **PropoleneGlycol** are all “built-in” fluids for EnergyPlus (that is, all of the appropriate properties are contained within the program). If the fluid specified here is a mixture of water and ethylene or propylene glycol, then only FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration objects need to be specified and the name of the appropriate one is used here. For another water/glycol mixture, a complete set of fluid property data (FluidProperties:Name and FluidProperties:Temperature objects plus multiple FluidProperties:Concentration objects for specific heat, density, etc.) must be specified (Ref dataset: GlycolPropertiesRefData.idf).

#### Field: Condenser Equipment Operation Scheme Name

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the condenser operation scheme. This field ties to the Condenser Operation Schemes input structure, which must also be defined.

#### Field: Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name

This alpha field is used to identify the node which the Loop Manager will access the temperature setpoint that it will try to maintain. This is typically the Condenser Loop Supply Side Outlet Node so that it will not interfere with component temperature setpoints. An associated temperature setpoint manager will need to be defined.

#### Field: Maximum Loop Temperature

This numeric field contains the maximum allowable temperature in Celsius for this loop.

#### Field: Minimum Loop Temperature

This numeric field contains the minimum allowable temperature in Celsius for this loop. This minimum loop temperature is used by the cooling towers to make sure that the minimum is not violated to keep the equipment safe. The minimum is also used to trigger the minimum temperature warning and will notify the user if it gets too low.

#### Field: Maximum Loop Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the maximum loop flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable.

#### Field: Minimum Loop Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the minimum loop flow rate in cubic meters per second.

#### Field: Condenser Loop Volume

Volume of the condenser loop in m<sup>3</sup>. This numeric field contains the loop volume for the entire loop, i.e., both the demand side and the supply side. This is used for the loop capacitance calculation. Loop volume (m<sup>3</sup>) could be calculated from pipe size data but this is not usually known. If zero volume is specified the loop has no fluid heat capacity. If a very large capacitance is specified unrealistic time delay may result and there may be poor response to changes in loop setpoint temperature. The loop capacitance **autocalculate** option gives reasonable values for most system sizes. This calculation is described in the Engineering Reference manual.

#### Field: Condenser Side Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Condenser Side Inlet Node. This node is the inlet to the supply side of the loop.

#### Field: Condenser Side Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Condenser Side Outlet Node. This node is the outlet of the supply side of the loop.

#### Field: Condenser Side Branch List Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Condenser Side Branch List. The list referenced here should list all the branches on the supply side of the loop.

#### Field: Condenser Side Connector List Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Condenser Side Connector List.  The list referenced here should list the splitter and mixer on the supply side of the loop.



#### Field: Demand Side Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Inlet Node.  This node is the inlet to the demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Demand Side Outlet Nodes Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Outlet Node. This node is the outlet of the demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Condenser Demand Side Branch List Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Branch List.  The list referenced here should list all the branches on the demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Condenser Demand Side Connector List Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Connector List. The list referenced here should list the splitter and mixer on the demand side of the loop.

#### Field: Load Distribution Scheme

This alpha field contains the Load Distribution Scheme Keyword. The Load Distribution Scheme selects the algorithm used to sequence equipment operation in order to meet the plant loop demand. Currently, five schemes are functional. **Optimal** operates each piece of equipment at its optimal part load ratio and will operate the last component between its minimum and maximum part load ratio in order to meet the loop demand. **SequentialLoad** loads each piece of equipment sequentially in the order specified in the PlantEquipmentList to its maximum part load ratio and will operate the last required piece of equipment between its minimum and maximum part load ratio in order to meet the loop demand. **UniformLoad** evenly distributes the loop demand among all available components on the equipment list for a given load range. **SequentialUniformPLR** loads all equipment on the PlantEquipmentList to a uniform part load ratio (PLR). Components are loaded sequentially based on the order specified in the PlantEquipmentList until each component is fully loaded, at which point the next subsequent component is added and the load is distributed uniformly based on PLR between the components. **UniformPLR** will load all equipment on the PlantEquipmentList to a uniform part load ratio (PLR). No equipment will be loaded below its minimum PLR. If the total load is less than the sum of all equipment on the PlantEquipmentList operating at their respective minimum PLRs, then the last item in the equipment list is dropped and the load is distributed based on a uniform PLR for the remaining plant equipment.

Note: For all schemes, if the load for any individual component is less than the component load at the minimum PLR, the individual component model will false load or reduce duty cycle while operating at the minimum part load ratio until the load is met.

#### Field: Pressure Simulation Type

This field lets user to choose if this plant loop will be involved in a pressure drop calculation.  This requires that at least one branch on the loop have pressure drop data.  If not, an error will be thrown due to the input mismatch.  Currently there are two pressure drop simulation types: “PumpPowerCorrection” and “LoopFlowCorrection”.  In both of these methods, branch pressure drop data is used to calculate a dynamic loop pressure drop and is used to update pumping power accordingly.  The flow correction method allows the user to enter information regarding the pressure curve of a constant speed pump so that the simulation can dynamically resolve the pressure vs. flow relationship in the plant loop.  This is limited to constant speed pumps, as the variable speed pumps are expected to resolve as if it were controlled by a variable drive, so that they can inherently meet any pressure and flow demand required by the loop.  This is also limited to “loop pumps”, where there is a single pump on the plant loop.  Common pipe simulations and “branch pump” simulations are not compatible with this level of pressure simulation.  See the documentation for the Pump:ConstantSpeed in order to determine required inputs for this pressure simulation method to be performed.  In the pressure drop system, parallel flow rates are not resolved (to match the pressure drop for the parallel system).  Enhancements to this calculation are planned which will allow parallel branch flow resolution.  See the Engineering Reference document for more information on how this works.

### Condenser Loop Outputs

* HVAC,Average,Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate [W]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate [W]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Supply Side Inlet Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Supply Side Inlet Temperature [C]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Supply Side Outlet Temperature [C]

* HVAC,Average,Cond Loop Demand Not Distributed [W]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Demand Side Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Supply Side Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

* HVAC,Average,Plant Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]


#### Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate [W]

This is the value of the net demand required to meet the cooling setpoint of the loop.  If the loop setpoint is met for the current HVAC timestep, Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate will equal sum of the total cooling demand from the demand side components on the loop (typically condenser coils of chillers, etc.).  It will also equal the cooling output of all condensing equipment such as cooling towers on the loop less any pump heat added to the fluid.  For example, for a condenser loop with one tower and one pump serving one chiller, Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate will equal the tower water-side heat transfer less the pump heat to fluid, and it will also equal the chiller condenser heat transfer rate.

If the condenser loop setpoint is not met, Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate will equal the sum of the total cooling demand from the demand side components on the loop plus the additional cooling required to bring the loop flow to setpoint.  If the loop remains off setpoint for successive timesteps, the demand required to return to setpoint will repeat in each timestep until the loop reaches setpoint.  For this reason, Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate should not be summed over time, because it will overstate the demand whenever the loop is off setpoint.

#### Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate [W]

This is the value of the net demand required to meet the heating setpoint of the loop.  If the loop setpoint is met for the current HVAC timestep, Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate will equal sum of the total heating demand from the demand side components on the loop.  It will also equal the heating output of all heating equipment on the supply side of the loop plus any pump heat added to the fluid.  For example, for a condenser loop with one ground loop heat exchanger and one pump serving one water-to-water heat pump, Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate will equal the ground loop heat transfer plus the pump heat to fluid, and it will also equal the heat pump condenser side heat transfer rate.

If the condenser loop setpoint is not met, Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate will equal the sum of the total heating demand from the demand side components on the loop plus the additional heating required to bring the loop flow to setpoint.  If the loop remains off setpoint for successive timesteps, the demand required to return to setpoint will repeat in each timestep until the loop reaches setpoint.  For this reason, Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate should not be summed over time, because it will overstate the demand whenever the loop is off setpoint.

#### Plant Supply Side Inlet Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]

This is the value of the mass flow rate at the Inlet to Condenser Loop on the supply side. There is not an associated Condenser Loop outlet node flow rate since continuity must be maintained in the loop and the outlet must be the same.

#### Plant Supply Side Inlet Temperature [C]

This is the value of the temperature at the Inlet to the condenser loop on the supply side.

#### Cond Loop OutletNode Temperature [C]

This is the value of the temperature at the outlet to the condenser loop on the supply side.

#### Cond Loop Demand Not Distributed [W]

This is the value of the demand that could not be distributed to the condenser equipment because of some constraint in the operation scheme.  This is a record of the loop operation scheme supervisory controls after attempting to distribute the load.  For example it would be  non-zero in situations where the load is larger than the upper limit of capacities set for the condenser equipment controls.  This output is for *before* the equipment has actually been simulated whereas the separate output Plant Supply Side Unmet Demand Rate is for *after* the equipment has simulated.

#### Plant Supply Side Unmet Demand Rate [W]

This is the value of the demand NOT provided by the condenser equipment to meet the heating or cooling setpoint of the loop. The value is positive when the condenser equipment cannot meet the setpoint, and the value is negative when the condenser equipment provides more than enough heating or cooling to meet the setpoint. A negative value can happen when the amount of demand is smaller than the minimum capacity of the equipment using the minimum part load ratio.

#### Plant Demand Side Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

This field is the demand side pressure drop of a condenser loop.  This output is only recognized if a valid pressure simulation is being performed.  To do this, the user must specify a pressure simulation type as an input in the CondenserLoop object, and input at least one pressure drop curve on a branch of the plant/condenser loop.  This particular output is only relevant if the user puts that curve on the demand side of the loop.

#### Plant Supply Side Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

This field is the supply side pressure drop of a condenser loop.  This output is only recognized if a valid pressure simulation is being performed.  To do this, the user must specify a pressure simulation type as an input in the CondenserLoop object, and input at least one pressure drop curve on a branch of the plant/condenser loop.  This particular output is only relevant if the user puts that curve on the supply side of the loop.

####  Plant Loop Pressure Difference [Pa]

This field is the total pressure drop of a condenser loop.  This output is only recognized if a valid pressure simulation is being performed.  To do this, the user must specify a pressure simulation type as an input in the CondenserLoop object, and input at least one pressure drop curve on a branch of the plant/condenser loop.  This particular output is relevant regardless of the location of pressure drop curves: demand side, supply side, or both.


Group – Plant-Condenser Control
-------------------------------

### Operation Schemes (Plant and Condenser)

Plants and condenser loops must have some mechanism for controlling the operation of the loop and which equipment is available under what conditions. Since there may be multiple control schemes that are assigned various priorities associated with each loop, an overall operation scheme must be defined. The overall scheme consists of the object name, an identifying name that is referenced in the main plant or condenser loop statement, and a list of operation schemes. Each operation scheme must have the type of operation scheme, its identifying name, and the schedule that defines its availability. Note that the order in which the individual operation schemes appear in this list defines its priority versus the others with the same scheduled availability. The first scheme appearing in the list is given the highest priority, the second scheme has second highest priority, etc. In other words, if according to its schedule, the first operation scheme is available, then it is used by the simulation to define how the plant or condenser loop operates. If it is not available, the second operation scheme in the list is checked to see if it is available until the highest priority scheme that is also available is found.  To allow for simultaneous heating and cooling, there is one configuration where multiple operation schemes are available at a given timestep.  This is allowed if a user inputs both a heating range based operation and a cooling range based operation with overlapping schedules.  The simulation will look at the current loop demand to determine if the cooling scheme should be used or the heating scheme.  In other cases, if two schemes overlap (are available at the same time), a fatal error will be encountered.

### PlantEquipmentOperationSchemes

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Plant Operation Scheme. This name is placed in the Plant Loop object to select this scheme.

#### Field Set: (Component Object Type, Name, Schedule) up to 8

Operation schemes are listed in "priority" order.  Note that each scheme must address the entire load and/or condition ranges for the simulation. The actual one selected for use will be the first that is "Scheduled" on.  That is, if control scheme 1 is not "on" and control scheme 2 is -- then control scheme 2 is selected. Only plant equipment should be listed on a Control Scheme for this item.

#### Field: Control Scheme &lt;\#&gt; Object Type

This alpha field contains the keyword for the type of control scheme used. The options for plant control schemes are:

- PlantEquipmentOperation:Uncontrolled

- PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad

- PlantEquipmentOperation:HeatingLoad

- PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint

- PlantEquipmentOperation:ThermalEnergyStorage

- PlantEquipmentOperation:UserDefined

#### Field: Control Scheme &lt;\#&gt; Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the control scheme. These must be the named versions of the referenced Control Scheme (e.g.. a Uncontrolled Loop Operation with this name or a Cooling or Heating Load Range Based Operation with this name).

#### Field: Control Scheme &lt;\#&gt; Schedule

This alpha field contains the schedule name for the control scheme. This schedule consists of weeks and days, with the days containing “0 or 1” for each hour of the day. This binary schedule (0 for off, 1 for on) determines if the control scheme is operating for that hour of day or not.

Examples of this statement in two different IDFs:

```idf
PlantEquipmentOperationSchemes,
    CW Loop Operation,       !- Name
    PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad,  ! Control Scheme 1 Object Type
    Peak Operation,          !- Control Scheme 1 Name
    On Peak,                 !- Control Scheme 1 Schedule
    PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad,  ! Control Scheme 2 Object Type
    Off Peak Operation,      !- Control Scheme 2 Name
    Off Peak;                !- Control Scheme 2 Schedule

PlantEquipmentOperationSchemes,
    CW Loop Operation,       !- Name
    PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad,  ! Control Scheme 1 Object Type
    Central Chiller Only,    !- Control Scheme 1 Name
    PlantOnSched;            !- Control Scheme 1 Schedule
```


In the first IDF example, “PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad” is the type of control scheme. “Peak Operation” and “Off Peak Operation” are the names of two different load range based controls defined separately (see below -- ). “On Peak” and “Off Peak” are schedules defined elsewhere in the input file.

The load range based operation scheme has two statements associated with it: a main statement that defines the ranges that individual priority settings are valid and the lists of equipment that may be used for each range.

### CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Condenser Operation Scheme.

#### Field Set: (Component Object Type, Name, Schedule) up to 8

Operation schemes are listed in "priority" order.  Note that each scheme must address the entire load and/or condition ranges for the simulation. The actual one selected for use will be the first that is "Scheduled" on.  That is, if control scheme 1 is not "on" and control scheme 2 is -- then control scheme 2 is selected. Only condenser equipment should be listed on a Control Scheme for this item.

#### Field: Control Scheme &lt;\#&gt; Object Type

This alpha field contains the keyword for the type of control scheme used. The options for plant control schemes are:

This alpha field contains the keyword for the type of control scheme used. Currently, the available options are:

- PlantEquipmentOperation:Uncontrolled

- PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad

- PlantEquipmentOperation:HeatingLoad

- PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorDryBulb

- PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorWetBulb

- PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorDewpoint

- PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorRelativeHumidity

- PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorDryBulbDifference

- PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorWetBulbDifference

- PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorDewpointDifference

- PlantEquipmentOperation:UserDefined

The condenser operation schemes apply to the equipment on the ‘supply side’ of the condenser loop—pumps, cooling towers, ground coupled heat exchangers, etc. The keywords select the algorithm that will be used to determine which equipment is available for each timestep. The Load Schemes schemes select a user specified set of equipment for each user specified range of a particular simulation variable. Load schemes compare the demand on the condenser supply side with specified load ranges and associated equipment lists. Outdoor schemes compare the current value of an environmental parameter with user specified ranges of that parameter.

#### Field: Control Scheme &lt;\#&gt; Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the control scheme.

#### Field: Control Scheme &lt;\#&gt; Schedule

This alpha field contains the schedule name for the control scheme. This schedule consists of weeks and days, with the days containing “0 or 1” for each hour of the day. This binary schedule (0 for off, 1 for on) determines which control scheme is operating for a particular hour. The schedule facilitates daily or seasonal changes in control schemes to meet demand side management or energy conservation goals.

Scheduling conflicts are handled by selecting the first available scheme in order of appearance in the list.

Examples of this statement in two IDFs:

```idf
CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes,
    Tower Loop Operation,    !- CondenserOperationSchemeName
    PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad,  Control Scheme 1 Object Type
    Year Round Tower Operation,  !- Control Scheme 1 Name
    PlantOnSched;            !- Control Scheme 1 Schedule

CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes,Tower Loop Operation,
    PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad, Peak Load Operation, AFTERNOONSCHEDULE,
    PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad, OffPeak Load Operation, MORNINGSCHEDULE,
    PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorWetBulb, NightOperation, NIGHTSCHEDULE;
```


Each schedule (AFTERNOONSCHEDULE, MORNINGSCHEDULE, NIGHTSCHEDULE) invokes its associated operation scheme (Peak Load Operation, OffPeak Load Operation, NightOperation). The type of operation scheme and its name references the input syntax associated with the range specification and the associated equipment.

### PlantEquipmentOperation:Uncontrolled

Uncontrolled loop operation simply specifies a group of equipment that runs ‘uncontrolled’. If the loop runs, this equipment will run also, unless turned off by the loop flow resolver to maintain continuity in the fluid loop.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the control scheme.

#### Field: Equipment List Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the Equipment List. This field ties to the Load Range Equipment List input structure, which must also be defined.

#### Field: Equipment List Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the Equipment List. This field ties to the PlantEquipmentList or CondenserEquipmentList input structure, which must also be defined.

### PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad

### PlantEquipmentOperation:HeatingLoad

The PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad  and PlantEquipmentOperation:HeatingLoad objects define the different ranges and which equipment list is valid for each range. After the keyword and the identifying name, a series of data trios is expected. In each trio, there is a lower limit for the load range, an upper limit for the load range, and a name that links to an equipment availability list (the PlantEquipmentList or CondenserEquipmentList objects).

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the control scheme.

#### Field Set: (Lower limit, Upper Limit, Equip List name) up to 10

#### Field: Load Range &lt;\#&gt; Lower Limit

This numeric field contains the lower demand range (W) for the equipment list. If demand is below this value, then this equipment list will not turn on to meet the demand.

#### Field: Load Range &lt;\#&gt; Upper Limit

This numeric field contains the upper demand range (W) for the equipment list. If demand is above this value, then this equipment list will not turn on to meet the demand.

#### Field: Range &lt;\#&gt; Equipment List Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the Equipment List (i.e., the name of a PlantEquipmentList or CondenserEquipmentList object).

An example of these statements in an IDF is:

```idf
PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad, Peak Operation,
        0,7000,   Chiller Plant,
        7000,24500,   Chiller Plant and Purchased,
        24500,500000, Purchased Only;
```

This particular load based operation scheme (above) has three different ranges. “Chiller Plant”, “Chiller Plant and Purchased”, and “Purchased Only” are names which link to various PlantEquipmentList or CondenserEquipmentList objects as described below. Gaps may be left in the load ranges specified, but to operate equipment over the entire range the upper limit of a given range must equal the lower limit of the next range as shown in the example. If gaps are left in the load ranges specified, a warning message will be issued when the load to be met falls within a load range “gap”. If the user wishes to leave a load range “gap” for a specific reason (no equipment to operate on this plant [or condenser] loop within this load range) and does not want the warning messages to be generated, then specify a lower limit, upper limit and equipment list name for the gap and do not specify any equipment in the associated equipment list, as shown below.

```idf
PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad, Peak Operation,
    0,7000,   Chiller Plant,
    7000,7100, NoEquipmentOperationOnThisPlantLoop,
    7100,24500,   Chiller Plant and Purchased,
    24500,500000, Purchased Only;

PlantEquipmentList,
    Chiller Plant,           !- Name
    Chiller:Electric,        !- Equipment 1 Object Type
    Big Chiller;             !- Equipment 1 Name

PlantEquipmentList,
    Purchased Only,          !- Name
    DistrictCooling,         !- Equipment 1 Object Type
    Purchased Cooling;       !- Equipment 1 Name
```

### PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorDryBulb

### PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorWetBulb

### PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorRelativeHumidity

### PlantEquipmentOperation:OutdoorDewpoint

The outdoor operation objects define the different ranges of the various environmental parameters and which equipment list is valid for each range. After the keyword and the identifying name, a series of data trios is expected. In each trio, there is a lower limit for the load range, an upper limit for the load range, and a name that links to an equipment availability list (the CondenserEquipmentList).

The fields for each of these are:

### PlantEquipmentOperation:ThermalEnergyStorage

Users of thermal energy storage, particularly ice storage systems, are often faced with a challenge of specifying input for these systems.  Essentially, they have to define various setpoint managers, temperature schedules, etc. in order to make the system functional.  This plant/condenser control type simplifies the input somewhat by eliminating both a setpoint manager and a schedule for each piece of equipment that makes up the ice storage system.  In fact, this operation scheme internally creates the setpoint managers required by the equipment listed as operated by the scheme defined by this syntax.  While the more complex definition is possible and provides more flexibility like hourly variation of setpoint temperatures at the outlet of each piece of equipment, this input provides the most convenient method for making the system to work and assumes a single charging setpoint temperature and a single discharging setpoint temperature.  For most systems, this is all that is needed.

#### Field: Name

This field defines the name of the thermal energy (ice) storage plant equipment operation scheme that will be referenced by the PlantEquipmentOperationSchemes list in the plant input.

#### Field: On-Peak Schedule

This field defines the name of an integer schedule that determines when on-peak electric pricing is in effect.  This value is used to determine whether or not the ice storage system should be charging the ice storage unit.  In the schedule, a value of 1 (or greater) corresponds to being in the on-peak period while any value of 0 or less corresponds to being in the off-peak period.

#### Field: Charging Availability Schedule

This field defines the name of an integer schedule that determines whether or not the system may enter charging mode off-peak.  If the current value of the on-peak schedule is “off”, then charging can take place if the charging availability schedule is “on”.  If the on-peak schedule is “off” and charging availability is “off”, then charging is not allowed and the chiller and ice storage units controlled by this statement are operating to meet the non-charging chilled water temperature defined by the next input parameter. In this schedule, a value of 1 (or greater) corresponds to “on” when charging is available during an off-peak period while any value of 0 or less corresponds to chillers not being allowed to charge even during off-peak.

#### Field: Non-Charging Chilled Water Temperature

This field defines the chilled water temperature when the ice storage system is NOT in charging mode.  During these times, the storage system could be discharging or dormant depending on HVAC load conditions and ice storage controls.  This value is used as the setpoint temperature for chillers associated with this plant equipment operation scheme during non-cooling season and during cooling season during the on-peak period.  The cooling season and on-peak periods are defined by schedules reference to input above.

#### Field: Charging Chilled Water Temperature

This field defines the chilled water temperature when the ice storage system is in charging mode.  During these times, the chiller is producing a temperature low enough to generate ice in the ice storage unit.  This value is used as the setpoint temperature for chillers associated with this plant equipment operation scheme during the cooling season during the off-peak period.  The cooling season and on-peak periods are defined by schedules reference to input above.

#### Field Set: (Component Object Type, Name, Demand Calculation Node, Setpoint Node, Flow Rate, Operation Type)

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Object Type

This field specifies the type of equipment controlled by scheme.  This must be a thermal energy storage device (simple or detailed ice storage) or a chiller.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Name

This field specifies the name of the controlled equipment.  This name must be defined in the input as a valid ice storage device or chiller.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Demand Calculation Node Name

The component demand will be calculated using the difference between the temperature at the demand node and the component set point temperature.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Setpoint Node Name

Each component controlled under temperature based control will have its own set point different from the loop set point. This field specifies component set point node (Generally its outlet temperatures). This node is acted upon by a SetpointManager in order to obtain the setpoint at any simulation timestep.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Flow Rate

This numeric field specifies the design flow rate for the component specified in earlier fields.  This flow rate is used to calculate the component demand. The field can be set to autosize, if the user wants the program to calculate the design flow. This would generally be set to autosize when the user does not know the component flow rate and does a sizing calculation for the corresponding component.

#### Field: Component &lt;\#&gt; Operation Type

This alpha field specifies the operation mode for the equipment. The equipment can be in any of the three modes viz. Cooling, Heating and Dual. Dual is used when the components both as heating and cooling equipment (for example heat pumps).  Ice storage units can potentially either heat or cool the circulating fluid and thus should be defined as Dual mode.

### PlantEquipmentList

### CondenserEquipmentList

The PlantEquipmentList  and CondenserEquipmentList  specify available plant and condenser loop equipment respectively for any loop operation scheme. Each statement contains the object name, an identifying name (which links the definition back to one of the operation scheme statements) and a variable length of data pairs. These pairs refer to a plant equipment type and an identifying name. The type in this list of pairs must correspond to a valid plant object as described in the next subsection.

Note: If a PlantEquipmentList or CondenserEquipmentList object is specified with no equipment object types or equipment names, then the corresponding PlantEquipmentOperation:\* object will assume all available equipment on this plant (or condenser) loop should be OFF (not operate) within the specified lower/upper limit.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the Equipment List.

#### Field Set: (Object Type, Name) up to 10

Remember the order of equipment on this list determines operation priority. Equipment on the list first will try to meet demand first. These fields tie to the Equipment Definition input structure, which must also be defined.

#### Field: Equipment &lt;\#&gt; Object Type

This alpha field contains the keyword for the type of equipment in operation. Example: (Chiller:Electric, DistrictCooling). The full list of allowable plant equipment is valid plant objects as described in the next subsection.

#### Field: Equipment &lt;\#&gt; Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the equipment in operation. This distinguishes between two different pieces of equipment of the same type.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

```idf
PlantEquipmentList, Chiller Plant and Purchased,
        Chiller:Electric, Big Chiller,
        DistrictCooling, Purchased Cooling;
```

Note that this list is the middle range defined in the PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad statement named “Peak Operation” above. This defines the equipment available when the load encountered by the plant (chiller water demand, for example) is between 7000 W and 24500 W. EnergyPlus will run the “Big Chiller” first up to its capacity and then attempt to meet the remaining load (while in that range) with the next piece of equipment (in this case, “Purchased:Cooling”) in the list.

This output is the coefficient of performance for the chiller during cooling operation. It is calculated as the evaporator heat transfer rate (Chiller Evaporator Cooling Rate) divided by the “fuel” consumption rate by the chiller. For the constant COP and electric chillers, the “fuel” is electricity so the divisor is Chiller Electric Power [W]. For the absorption chiller, the “fuel” is steam so the divisor is Steam Consumption Rate [W].

*Note that this variable is reported as zero when the chiller is not operating. When reported for frequencies longer than "detailed" (such as timestep, hourly, daily, monthly or environment), this output will only be meaningful when the chiller is operating for the entire reporting period. To determine an average COP for a longer time period, compute the COP based on total evaporator heat transfer divided by total electric or fuel input over the desired period.*

#### Chiller Part Load Ratio

This output is the operating part-load ratio of the indirect absorption chiller. This output may fall below the minimum part-load ratio specified in the input. For this case, the Chiller Cycling Ratio is used to further define the performance of the indirect absorption chiller.

#### Chiller Cycling Ratio

This output is the fraction of the timestep the indirect absorption chiller operates. When the chiller operates above the minimum part-load ratio, a Chiller Cycling Ratio of 1 is reported. When the chiller operates below the minimum part-load ratio, the Chiller Cycling Ratio reports the fraction of the timestep the indirect absorption chiller operates.

#### Generator Heat Input Part Load Ratio Curve

The Generator Heat Input Part Load Ratio Curve is a quadratic equation that determines the Ratio of the generator load on the absorber to the demand on the chiller. The defining equation is:

<div>\[SteamInputRatio = \frac{{C1}}{{PLR}} + C2 + C3 * PLR\]</div>

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device’s evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller’s request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint at the evaporator outlet.  For this absorption chiller, this mode also affects the flow rate on the generator connection.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.  This flow mode does not impact the condenser loop connection.

#### Field: Generator Fluid Type

This choice field specifies the type of fluid used to heat the generator solution. The valid choices are **HotWater** or **Steam**. This field should be specified as Steam or left blank if the generator inlet/outlet nodes are not specified.

#### Field: Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the absorption chiller’s design condenser fluid flow rate in cubic meters per second.

#### Field: Degree of Subcooling in Steam Generator

Ideally, the steam trap located at the outlet of the generator should remove all the condensate immediately, however, there is a delay in this process in actual systems which causes the condensate to SubCool by a certain amount before leaving the generator. This amount of subcooling is included in the heat transferred to the solution in the generator. The minimum value is 0º Celsius and default is 5º Celsius. This field is not used when the generator inlet/outlet node are not specified or the generator is connected to a hot water loop.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Nominal Pumping Power, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate, Design Condenser Water Flow Rate and Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

### Chiller:Absorption:Indirect

The Chiller:Absorption:Indirect object is an enhanced version of the absorption chiller model found in the Building Loads and System Thermodynamics (BLAST) program. This enhanced model is nearly identical to the existing absorption chiller model (Ref. Chiller:Absorption) with the exceptions that: 1) the enhanced indirect absorption chiller model provides more flexible performance curves and 2) chiller performance now includes the impact of varying evaporator, condenser, and generator temperatures. Since these absorption chiller models are nearly identical (i.e., the performance curves of the enhanced model can be manipulated to produce similar results to the previous model), it is quite probable that the Chiller:Absorption model will be deprecated in a future release of EnergyPlus.

#### Field: Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the indirect absorption chiller.

#### Field: Nominal Capacity

This required numeric field contains the nominal cooling capability of the chiller in Watts. This field must be greater than 0 and is autosizable.

#### Field: Nominal Pumping Power

This required numeric field contains the nominal pumping power of the chiller in Watts. The minimum value for this field is 0 and is autosizable.

#### Field: Chilled Water Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller chilled water inlet node.

#### Field: Chilled Water Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller chilled water outlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser inlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the chiller outlet node.

#### Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum part load is not the load where the machine shuts off, but where the amount of power remains constant to produce smaller loads than this fraction.

#### Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.1.

#### Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP.

#### Field: Design Condenser Inlet Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller’s condenser inlet design temperature in Celsius. The default value for this field is 30º C and is only used when the Design Chilled Water Flow Rate is autosized.

#### Field: Condenser Inlet Temperature Lower Limit

This numeric field contains the chiller’s lower limit for the condenser entering water temperature in Celsius. The default value for this field is 15º C. If this limit is exceeded, a warning message will report the incident. No correction to chiller capacity is made for low condenser entering water temperatures.

#### Field: Chilled Water Outlet Temperature Lower Limit

This numeric field contains the chiller’s lower limit for the evaporator leaving water temperature in Celsius. The default value for this field is 5º C. If this limit is exceeded, a warning message will report the incident. No correction to chiller capacity is made for low evaporator leaving water temperatures.

#### Field: Design Chilled Water Flow Rate

This numeric input specifies the design evaporator volumetric flow rate in cubic meters per second. The value specified must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable. For variable volume chiller this is the maximum flow and for constant flow chiller this is the design flow rate.

#### Field: Design Condenser Water Flow Rate

This numeric field specifies the chiller’s design condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. The value specified must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device’s evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller’s request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint at the evaporator outlet.  For this absorption chiller, this mode also affects the flow rate on the generator connection.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.  This flow mode does not impact the condenser loop connection.

#### Field: Generator Heat Input Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

This required alpha field specifies the name of the curve used to determine the heat input to the chiller. The curve is a quadratic or cubic curve which characterizes the heat input as a function of chiller part-load ratio. The curve output is multiplied by the chiller’s nominal capacity and operating part-load ratio or minimum part-load ratio, whichever is greater, to determine the amount of heat input required for the given operating conditons.

#### Field: Pump Electric Input Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

This alpha field specifies the name of the curve used to determine the pump electrical input to the chiller. The curve is a quadratic or cubic curve which characterizes the pump electrical power as a function of chiller part-load ratio. The curve output is multiplied by the chiller’s nominal pumping power and operating part-load ratio or minimum part-load ratio, whichever is greater, to determine the amount of pumping power required for the given operating conditons.

#### Field: Generator Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Generator Inlet Node. A steam or hot water loop is not required to simulate an indirect absorption chiller. If a steam/hot water loop is used, enter the name of the generator inlet node.

#### Field: Generator Outlet Node Name

This alpha field specifies the name of a quadratic or cubic curve which correlates the chiller’s heat input as a function of evaporator leaving water temperature. This curve is used to correct generator heat input at off-design evaporator temperatures.

#### Field: Generator Heat Source Type

This choice field specifies the type of fluid used to heat the generator solution. The valid choices are **HotWater** or **Steam**. This input is used to identify the method used to calculate the generator mass flow rate. This field is not used if the generator inlet/outlet nodes are not specified. The default value is Steam.

#### Field: Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate

This numeric field specifies the chiller’s design generator *fluid* flow rate in cubic meters per second. The value specified must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable. For variable flow chillers this is the maximum generator flow rate, for constant flow chillers this is the flow rate.

#### Field: Temperature Lower Limit Generator Inlet

This numeric field specifies the lower limit of the generator’s entering water temperature. This field is not used iif the Generator Fluid Type is specified as steam.

#### Field: Degree of Subcooling in Steam Generator

Ideally the steam trap located at the outlet of generator should remove all the condensate immediately, however there is a delay in this process in actual systems which causes the condensate to SubCool by a certain degree before leaving the generator. This amount of subcooling is included in the heat transferred to the solution in the generator. The minimum value is 0º Celsius, the maximum value is 20º Celsius, and the default is 1º Celsius.

#### Field: Degree of Subcooling in Steam Condensate Loop

This essentially represents the heat loss to the atmosphere due to uninsulated condensate return piping to the boiler. Condensate return piping operates at atmospheric pressure and is not insulated. The condensate sub cools to certain degree before it is pumped back to the boiler. The minimum value is 0º Celsius and the default is 0º Celsius.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Nominal Pumping Power, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate, Design Condenser Water Flow Rate and Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and a condenser inlet node name is specified here, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates an outdoor air node and the air temperature information on this node is taken directly from the weather file (no node height adjustment).

#### Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller condenser side outlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates a condenser side outlet air node.

This alpha field determines what type of condenser will be modeled with this chiller. The 3 type of condensers are AirCooled, WaterCooled, and EvaporativelyCooled with the default being AirCooled if not specified.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device’s evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller’s request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

This numeric field contains the electric chiller’s design condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable. This field is also used to enter the air flow rate if the Condenser Type = AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and Heat Recovery is specified.

#### Capacity Ratio Curve

The Capacity Ratio Curve is a quadratic equation that determines the Ratio of Available Capacity to Nominal Capacity. The defining equation is:

<div>\[AvailToNominalCapacityRatio = {C_1} + {C_2}{\Delta_{temp}} + {C_3}\Delta_{temp}^2\]</div>

Where the Delta Temperature is defined as:

<div>\[{\Delta_{{\rm{Temp}}}} = \frac{{{\rm{TempCondIn  -  TempCondInDesign }}}}{{{\rm{TempRiseCoefficient}}}} - ({\rm{TempEvapOut  -  TempEvapOutDesign)}}\]</div>

TempCondIn = Temperature entering the condenser (water or air temperature depending on condenser type).

TempCondInDesign = Design Condenser Inlet Temperature from User input above.

TempEvapOut = Temperature leaving the evaporator.

TempEvapOutDesign = Design Chilled Water Outlet Temperature from User input above.

TempRiseCoefficient = User Input from above.

The following three fields contain the coefficients for the quadratic equation.

#### Field: Coefficient 1 of Capacity Ratio Curve

This numeric field contains the first coefficient for the capacity ratio curve.

#### Field: Coefficient 2 of Capacity Ratio Curve

This numeric field contains the second coefficient for the capacity ratio curve.

#### Field: Coefficient 3 of Capacity Ratio Curve

This numeric field contains the third coefficient for the capacity ratio curve.

#### Power Ratio Curve

The Power Ratio Curve is a quadratic equation that determines the Ratio of Full Load Power at Available Capacity to Full Load Power at Nominal Capacity. The defining equation is:

<span>\(FullLoadPowerRatio = {C_1} + {C_2}AvailToNominalCapRatio + {C_3}AvailToNominalCapRati{o^2}\)</span>The following three fields contain the coefficients for the quadratic equation.

#### Field: Coefficient1 of the power ratio curve

This numeric field contains the first coefficient for the power ratio curve.

#### Field: Coefficient 2 of Power Ratio Curve

This numeric field contains the second coefficient for the power ratio curve.

#### Field: Coefficient 3 of Power Ratio Curve

This numeric field contains the third coefficient for the power ratio curve.

#### Full Load Ratio Curve

The Full Load Ratio Curve is a quadratic equation that determines the fraction of full load power. The defining equation is:

<div>\[FracFullLoadPower = {C_1} + {C_2}PartLoadRatio + {C_3}PartLoadRati{o^2}\]</div>

The following three fields contain the coefficients for the quadratic equation.

#### Field: Coefficient 1 of Full Load Ratio Curve

This numeric field contains the first coefficient for the full load ratio curve.

#### Field: Coefficient 2 of Full Load Ratio Curve

This numeric field contains the second coefficient for the full load ratio curve.

#### Field: Coefficient 3 of Full Load Ratio Curve

This numeric field contains the third coefficient for the full load ratio curve.

#### Field: Chilled Water Outlet Temperature Lower Limit

This numeric field contains the lower limit for the evaporator outlet temperature. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the fluid doesn’t get too cold.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device’s evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller’s request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate

This is the design flow rate used if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 then a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next 2 node fields. To determine how the heat recovery algorithm works look at the Engineering Manual at the Chiller:Electric with Heat Recovery section. The units are in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable.  When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below. Note that heat recovery is only available with Condenser Type = WaterCooled.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric chiller heat recovery side inlet node. A heat recovery loop must be specified.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric chiller heat recovery side outlet node. A heat recovery loop must be specified.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller’s electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

#### Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction

This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop’s demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop’s demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller’s that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluids.

### Chiller:Electric:EIR

This chiller model is the empirical model used in the DOE-2.1 building energy simulation program. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer’s catalog data or measured data. Performance curves for more than 160 chillers, including the default DOE-2.1E reciprocating and centrifugal chillers, are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf).

Note: Chiller:Electric:EIR objects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should normally be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with caution.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric EIR chiller.

#### Field: Reference Capacity

This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the chiller in Watts. This should be the capacity of the chiller at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. Alternately, this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference COP

This numeric field contains the chiller’s coefficient of performance. This value should **not** include energy use due to pumps or cooling tower fans. This COP should be at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. This value **should** include evap-cooled or air-cooled condenser fans except when the Condenser Fan Power Ratio input field defined below is used and that input value is greater than 0. For the case when condenser fan power is modeled separately, the calculated condenser fan energy is reported on the same electric meter as compressor power. Be careful to not duplicate this energy use.

#### Field: Reference Leaving Chilled Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller’s reference leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 6.67°C.

#### Field: Reference Entering Condenser Fluid Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller’s reference entering condenser fluid temperature in Celsius. The default value is 29.4°C. For water-cooled chillers this is the water temperature entering the condenser (e.g., leaving the cooling tower). For air- or evap-cooled condensers this is the entering outdoor air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature, respectively.

#### Field: Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate

For a variable flow chiller this is the maximum water flow rate and for a constant flow chiller this is the operating water flow rate through the chiller’s evaporator. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference Condenser Fluid Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the chiller’s operating condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field can be autosized. This field is also used to enter the air flow rate if Condenser Type = AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and Heat Recovery is specified..

#### Field: Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the cooling capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the entering condenser fluid temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the entering condenser fluid temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

The name of a quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRfTPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller’s available cooling capacity. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio’s would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0 (i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR’s slightly above or below this line (i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The quadratic curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. Below this part-load ratio, the compressor cycles on and off to meet the cooling load. The Minimum Part Load Ratio must be less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.1.

#### Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.0. The Maximum Part Load Ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Minimum Unloading Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s minimum unloading ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum unloading ratio is where the chiller capacity can no longer be reduced by unloading and must be false loaded to meet smaller cooling loads. A typical false loading strategy is hot-gas bypass. The minimum unloading ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.2.

#### Field: Chilled Water Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) inlet node.

#### Field: Chilled Water Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) outlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side inlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and a condenser inlet node name is specified here, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates an outdoor air node and the air temperature information on this node is taken directly from the weather file (no node height adjustment).

#### Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side outlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates a condenser side outlet air node.

#### Field: Condenser Type

This alpha field determines what type of condenser will be modeled with this chiller. Valid condenser types are AirCooled, WaterCooled, and EvaporativelyCooled with the default being WaterCooled if not specified. AirCooled and EvaporativelyCooled do not require a Condenser Loop to be specified, whereas the WaterCooled option requires the full specification of the Condenser Loop and its associated equipment.

#### Field: Condenser Fan Power Ratio

This field is used to model condenser fan power associated with air-cooled or evaporatively-cooled condensers (for cooling towers, refer to Group - Condenser Equipment). Enter the ratio of the condenser fan power to the reference chiller cooling capacity in W/W. If this input is greater than 0, the condenser fan power is modeled seperatly from compressor power. In addition, if condenser fan power is modeled using this input, the reference COP and “Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of ” performance curves should not include condenser fan power.

#### Field: Fraction of Compressor Electric Power Rejected by Condenser

This numeric input represents the fraction of compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. Enter a value of 1.0 when modeling hermetic chillers. For open chillers, enter the compressor motor efficiency. This value must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, with a default value of 1.0.

#### Field: Leaving Chilled Water Lower Temperature Limit

This numeric field contains the lower limit for the leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the fluid doesn’t get too cold. This input field is currently unused. The default value is 2°C.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device’s evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller’s request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate

This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 (or Autosize), a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.  This field is autosizable.  When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below. Note that heat recovery is only available with Condenser Type = WaterCooled.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side inlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side outlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Capacity, Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate and Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller’s electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

#### Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction

This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop’s demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop’s demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller’s that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluilds.

Most of these chiller output variables are defined above under "Generic Chiller Outputs."  Output variables not described above are discussed here.

#### Chiller Condenser Fan Electric Power  [W]

#### Chiller Condenser Fan Electric Energy  [J]

These outputs are for the electric power consumption of the chiller condenser fan and are applicable to air- or evaporatively-cooled chillers. These reports are available only for the Chiller:Electric:EIR and only when the Condenser Fan Power Ratio input field is greater than 0. This output is also added to a meter object with Resource Type = Electricity, End Use Key = Chillers, Group Key = Plant (Ref. Output:Meter objects).

#### Chiller Capacity Temperature Modifier Multiplier []

This is the output of the curve object Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve.

#### Chiller EIR Temperature Modifier Multiplier []

This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve.

#### Chiller EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier []

This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Curve.

#### Chiller Part Load Ratio []

This output is the ratio of the evaporator heat transfer rate plus the false load heat transfer rate (if applicable) to the available chiller capacity. This value is used to determine Chiller EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier.

#### Chiller Cycling Ratio []

The cycling ratio is the amount of time the chiller operates during each simulation timestep. If the chiller part-load ratio falls below the minimum part-load ratio, the chiller cycles on and off to meet the cooling load.

#### Chiller False Load Heat Transfer Rate [W]

#### Chiller False Load Heat Transfer Energy [J]

These outputs are the heat transfer rate and total heat transfer due to false loading of the chiller. When the chiller part-load ratio is below the minimum unloading ratio, the chiller false loads (e.g. hot-gas bypass) to further reduce capacity. The false load heat transfer output variable is not metered.

### Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR

This chiller model, developed through the CoolTools™ project sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), is an empirical model similar to EnergyPlus’ Chiller:Electric:EIR model. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. The model has the same capabilities as the Chiller:Electric:EIR model, but can potentially provide significant accuracy improvement over the Chiller:Electric:EIR model for variable-speed compressor drive and variable condenser water flow applications. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer’s catalog data or measured data. Performance curves developed from manufacturer’s performance data are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf). This chiller model can be used to predict the performance of various chiller types (e.g., reciprocating, screw, scroll, and centrifugal) with water-cooled condensers.

The main difference between this model and the Chiller:Electric:EIR model is the condenser fluid temperature used in the associated performance curves: the Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR model uses the LEAVING condenser water temperature while the Chiller:Electric:EIR model uses the ENTERING condenser water temperature.

Note: Chiller:Electric:Reformulated EIR objects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should almost always be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with extreme caution. For example, if the user wishes to model a chiller size that is different from the reference capacity, it is highly recommended that the reference flow rates be scaled proportionately to the change in reference capacity. Although this model can provide more accurate prediction than the Chiller:Electric:EIR model, it requires more performance data to develop the associated performance curves (at least 12 points from full-load performance and 7 points from part-load performance).

#### Field: Chiller Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for this chiller.

#### Field: Reference Capacity

This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the chiller in Watts. This should be the capacity of the chiller at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. Alternately, this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference COP

This numeric field contains the chiller’s coefficient of performance. This value should **not** include energy use due to pumps or cooling tower fans. This COP should be at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below.

#### Field: Reference Leaving Chilled Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller’s reference leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 6.67°C.

#### Field: Reference Leaving Condenser Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the chiller’s reference leaving condenser water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 35°C.

#### Field: Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate

For a variable flow chiller this is the maximum water flow rate and for a constant flow chiller this is the operating water flow rate through the chiller’s evaporator. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the chiller’s operating condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.

#### Field: Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the cooling capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Type

This choice field determines which type of the Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve is used in the chiller modeling. Two curve types are available: (1) Type LeavingCondenserWaterTemperature is based on the leaving condenser water temperature. (2) Type Lift is based on the normalized lift, which is the temperature difference between the leaving condenser water temperature and the leaving evaporator water temperature. 

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

The name of the Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve. The form of this curve is based on the input for Electric Input to Cooling Output RatioFunction of Part Load Ratio Curve Type. For the type of LeavingCondenserWaterTemperature, the curve object type should be Curve:Bicubic or Table:TwoIndependentVariables that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature. For the type of Lift, the curve object type should be Curve:ChillerPartLoadWithLiftCurves or Table:MultiVariableLookup that parameterizes the variation of EIR as a function of the normalized fractional Lift, normalized Tdev and the PLR. Tdev is the difference between Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and Reference Chilled Water Temperature. Lift is the Leaving Condenser Water Temperature and Leaving Chilled Water Temperature.  The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).

#### Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

The name of a bicubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving condenser water temperature and the part-load ratio (EIRfTPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller’s available cooling capacity. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference leaving condenser water temperature with the part-load ratio equal to 1.0. An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio’s would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0 (i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR’s slightly above or below this line (i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The bicubic curve should be valid for the range of condenser water temperatures and part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).

Note: Although a bicubic curve requires 10 coefficients (ref. Curve:Bicubic), coefficients 7, 9 and 10 are typically not used in the performance curve described here and should be entered as 0 unless sufficient performance data and regression accuracy exist to justify the use of these coefficients. Additionally, coefficients 2, 3, and 6 should not be used unless sufficient temperature data is available to accurately define the performance curve (i.e., negative values may result from insufficient data).

#### Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. Below this part-load ratio, the compressor cycles on and off to meet the cooling load. The Minimum Part Load Ratio must be less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.1.

#### Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.0. The Maximum Part Load Ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Minimum Unloading Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller’s minimum unloading ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum unloading ratio is where the chiller capacity can no longer be reduced by unloading and must be false loaded to meet smaller cooling loads. A typical false loading strategy is hot-gas bypass. The minimum unloading ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.2.

#### Field: Chilled Water Side Inlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) inlet node.

#### Field: Chilled Water Side Outlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) outlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Side Inlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side inlet node.

#### Field: Condenser Side Outlet Node

This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side outlet node.

#### Field: Fraction of Compressor Electric Power Rejected by Condenser

This numeric input represents the fraction of compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. Enter a value of 1.0 when modeling hermetic chillers. For open chillers, enter the compressor motor efficiency. This value must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, with a default value of 1.0.

#### Field: Leaving Chilled Water Lower Temperature Limit

This numeric field contains the lower limit for the leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the water doesn’t get too cold. This input field is currently unused. The default value is 2°C.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode Type

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device’s evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller’s request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate

This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 (or autosize), a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.  This field is autosizable.  When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side inlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified and it can only be used with a water-cooled condenser.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side outlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified and it can only be used with a water-cooled condenser.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Capacity, Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate and Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction

This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name

This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop’s demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop’s demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller’s that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluilds.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name

#### Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side outlet.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device’s evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller’s request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Maximum Temperature for Heat Recovery at Heat Recovery Outlet Node

This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.

As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply. The temperature is specified in degrees C.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller’s electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0, a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side inlet.  If a loop is connected, then the jacket and lubricant heat will be recovered.  There is no need for an effectiveness term, since the jacket and lubricant recovered heat energies are the actual recovered energies.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side outlet.

#### Field: Chiller Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device’s evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller’s request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Fuel Type

This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the chiller uses. Valid choices are: **NaturalGas, PropaneGas, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, OtherFuel1** or **OtherFuel2**. The default is **NaturalGas**.

#### Field: Heat Recovery Maximum Temperature

This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery.  The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit.  This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.

As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller.  For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field.  The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting.  This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.

The temperature is specified in degrees C.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller’s electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

### ChillerHeater:Absorption:DirectFired

This chiller is a direct fired absorption chiller-heater which is modeled using performance curves similar to the equivalent chiller in DOE-2.1E.

The model is based the following two equations:

<div>\[FuelUsed = \frac{{TheoreticalFuelUse}}{{NormalizedBoilerEfficiencyCurveOutput}}\]</div>

<div>\[Linear \to Eff = {A_0} + {A_1}\cdot PLR\]</div>

#### Field: Nominal Thermal Efficiency

This required numeric field contains the heating efficiency (as a fraction between 0 and 1) of the boiler’s burner.  This is the efficiency relative to the higher heating value (HHV) of fuel at a part load ratio of 1.0 and the temperature entered for the Design Boiler Water Outlet Temp. Manufacturers typically specify the efficiency of a boiler using the higher heating value of the fuel. For the rare occurences when a manufacturers (or particular data set) thermal efficiency is based on the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel, multiply the thermal efficiency by the lower-to-higher heating value ratio. For example, assume a fuel’s lower and higher heating values are approximately 45,450 and 50,000 kJ/kg, respectively. For a manuracturers thermal effiency rating of 0.90 (based on the LHV), the nominal thermal efficiency entered here is 0.82 (i.e. 0.9 multiplied by 45,450/50,000).

#### Field: Efficiency Curve Temperature Evaluation Variable

This field is used to control which value for hot water temperature is used when evaluating the efficiency curve specified in the next field (if applicable).  There are two options,  EnteringBoiler or LeavingBoiler.  EnteringBoiler indicates that the efficiency curves will be evaluated using the temperature at boiler inlet node.  LeavingBoiler indicates that the efficiency curves will be evaluated using the temperature at the boiler outlet.  This field is only used if type of curve is one that uses temperature as a independent variable.

#### Field: Normalized Boiler Efficiency Curve Name

This alpha field contains the curve name which describes the normalized heating efficiency (as a fraction of nominal thermal efficiency) of the boiler’s burner. If this field is left blank, the nominal thermal efficiency is assumed to be constant (i.e., Fuel Used is equal to the Theoretical Fuel Use in the equation above). When a boiler efficiency curve is used, the curve may be any valid curve object with 1 (PLR) or 2 (PLR and boiler outlet water temperature) independent variables. A tri-quadratic curve object is not allowed since it uses 3 independent variables. The linear, quadratic, and cubic curve types may be used when the boiler efficiency is solely a function of boiler part-load ratio (PLR). When this type of curve is used, the boiler should operate at (or very near) the design boiler water outlet temperature. Other curve types may be used when the boiler efficiency is a function of both PLR and boiler water temperature. Examples of valid single and dual independent variable equations are shown below. For all curve types PLR is always the x independent variable. When using 2 independent variables, the boiler outlet water temperature (Toutlet) is always the y independent variable.

<div>\[Quadratic \to Eff = {A_0} + {A_1}\cdot PLR + {A_2}\cdot PL{R^2}\]</div>

<div>\[Cubic \to Eff = {A_0} + {A_1}\cdot PLR + {A_2}\cdot PL{R^2} + {A_3}\cdot PL{R^3}\]</div>

<div>\[Cubic \to Eff = {A_0} + {A_1}\cdot PLR + {A_2}\cdot PL{R^2} + {A_3}\cdot PL{R^3}\]</div>

<div>\[BiQuadratic \to Eff = {A_0} + {A_1}\cdot PLR + {A_2}\cdot PL{R^2} + {A_3}\cdot {T_w} + {A_4}\cdot {T_w}^2 + {A_5}\cdot PLR\cdot {T_w}\]</div>

<div>\[QuadraticLinear \to Eff = {A_0} + {A_1}\cdot PLR + {A_2}\cdot PL{R^2} + {A_3}\cdot {T_w} + {A_4}\cdot PLR\cdot {T_w} + {A_5}\cdot PL{R^2}\cdot {T_w}\]</div>

<div>\[\begin{array}{l}Bicubic \to Eff = {A_0} + {A_1}\cdot PLR + {A_2}\cdot PL{R^2} + {A_3}\cdot {T_w} + {A_4}{T_w}^2 + {A_5}PLR\cdot {T_w} + {A_6}PL{R^3}\\\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad  + {A_7}\cdot {T_w}^3 + {A_8}\cdot PL{R^2}\cdot {T_w} + {A_9}\cdot PLR\cdot {T_w}^2\end{array}\]</div>

where

Eff = normalized boiler efficiency

PLR = boiler part-load ratio

T<sub>w</sub> = boiler water temperature [ºC] ], this can be either entering or leaving temperature depending on the setting in the previous field

#### Field: Design Water Outlet Temperature

This numeric field contains the desired boiler water outlet temperature in Celsius.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the maximum design water volumetric flow rate in m<sup>3</sup>/sec. This should be the largest flow rate than can be heated to the design outlet temperature. This field is autosizable.

#### Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the minimum part load ratio. If the ratio of demand to boiler nominal capacity is less than the minimum part load ratio, then the Min PLR will determine the operating PLR. The expected range is between 0 and 1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.0.

#### Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the maximum part load ratio. If the ratio of demand to boiler nominal capacity is greater than the maximum part load ratio, then the Max PLR will determine the operating PLR. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the optimum part load ratio. This is the part load ratio at which the boiler performs at its maximum efficiency. If this field is left blank, the default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Boiler Water Inlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the water inlet node name.

#### Field: Boiler Water Outlet Node Name

This required alpha field contains the water outlet node name.

#### Field: Water Outlet Upper Temperature Limit

This numeric field contains the outlet temperature upper limit. If this field is left blank, the default value is 99.9ºC.

#### Field: Boiler Flow Mode

This choice field determines how the boiler operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler’s request for flow is more strict and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the boiler model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the boiler matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the boiler -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.   The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

#### Field: Parasitic Electric Load

This optional numeric field contains the parasitic electric power (W) consumed by a forced draft fan or other electrical device associated with the boiler. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the boiler is operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if the field is left blank.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity and Design Water Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

### Water to Water Heat Pumps

The EnergyPlus has two water-to-water heat pump models, parameter estimation and equation fit, to choose from:

**HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling**

**HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating**

This model is an equation-fit model from the catalog data which resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The performance of the heat pump is modeled using curves fitted from the catalog data.

**HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Cooling**

**HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Heating**

This model is a parameter estimation based model that uses physical parameters generated from the catalog data. The physical parameters are then used to predict the performance of the heat pump using thermodynamic laws and heat transfer equations. The heat pump has a reciprocating compressor that serves both the hot water and the chilled water loop. Note that this model is currently “hardwired” to fluid property R22.

Descriptions and strength of each respective model is available in the following references:

Since the heat pump is defined with two separate objects (one for heating, one for cooling), the connections to the condenser has to be done carefully. The example below shows the configuration for parameter estimation objects. The same specifications and configuration also applies to the equation fit model.

#### Steps to specify the Ground Source Heat Pump

For the heating mode:

1. Specify a branch for the Heat pump in hot water loop .

2. Include the branch name in the splitter and mixer branches.

3. Add a branch in condenser loop and include its name in the respective splitter and mixer.

### CentralHeatPumpSystem

This is a central geothermal application that contains one or more chiller-heaters centrally located in the building; the available chilled and/or hot water is then piped to the individual zones. Chiller-heaters used for this particular system can be of two types: 1) standard vapor-compression, non-reversible cycle chillers designed for heat recovery or 2) reversible-cycle, water-to-water heat pump chillers. Unlike a distributed ground source heat pump configuration where individual heat pumps are located in each zone, a centralized geothermal configuration has one or more chiller-heaters. Its function is to encapsulate the extra controls needed to turn individual chiller-heater modules on/off and whether they are to operate in cooling-only, heating-only or simultaneous cooling-heating mode and whether to connect the source water to the evaporator or condenser side. A variety of control schemes can be designed by setting schedules for both zone control types and individual chiller-heaters schedules.

The fluid used in this central system is usually water, and there is no sharing of condenser or evaporator water between multiple machines. However, the control logic is such that the source water can be delivered to individual chiller-heaters depending on their operating mode, e.g., modules in simultaneous cooling-heating mode receive no source water, modules in heating-only mode can have source water directed to their evaporator, or modules in cooling-only mode can have source water directed to their condenser; the decision on which module(s) receives the source water dictated by the ‘smart’ controls. The following figures illustrate node interconnections between this central geothermal application and plant and condenser loops in various situations.

The order of the multiple chiller-heaters’ operation is assumed to be sequential. In other words, the very first chiller-heater will be called at first to see if it meets all loads that the central heat pump system should meet. If the chiller-heater meets all loads, the rest chiller-heaters are assumed to be turned off. If not, the following chiller-heater will be called to meet the remaining loads until all loads are met in the order as defined in the set of individual chiller-heater objects below. The order of individual chiller-heater modules needs to be carefully arranged in case users are intended to see the performance of various combinations of different sizes of chiller-heaters in a central heat pump system.

Figure 76. Diagram of a central heat pump system with three chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode (Condensers reject heat to the ground source loop)



![](media/image186.png)

Figure 77. Diagram of a central heat pump system with three chiller-heaters in heat recovery mode         (No heat is exchanged with the ground source loop)



![](media/image187.png)

Figure 78. Diagram of a central heat pump system with one chiller-heater in heat recovery mode and two chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode

In the above example, the cooling load needs 3 chiller-heaters and the heating load needs 1 chiller heater. Chiller 1 is in heat recovery mode and isolated from the ground source loop while chillers 2 and 3 are in cooling-only mode, their condensers rejecting heat to the ground source loop.



![](media/image188.png)

Figure 79. Diagram of a central heat pump system with two chiller-heaters in heat recovery mode and one chiller-heater in heating-only mode

In the above example, the heating load needs 3 chiller-heaters and the cooling load needs two chiller-heaters. Chillers 1 and 2 are in heat recovery mode and isolated from the ground source loop while chiller 3 is in heating-only mode, its evaporator extracting heat from the ground source loop.

Users are required to define three different nodes such as chilled water, hot water, and source water nodes. Only this central heat pump system will be metered, and individual chiller-heaters’ energy will be available for reporting only, but not metered.

#### Field Set: Individual Chiller-Heater Module Objects

The following four items are repeated up to a maximum of 20 individual chiller-heater modulesets. At least one module set must appear in an input file. In other words, a central heat pump system must include at least one chiller-heater module component. A set of the following four fields helps to define the specific type of a chiller-heater module, its operation control, and the number of identical chiller-heater module objects.

#### Field: Chiller Heater Module Performance Component Object Type &lt;x&gt;

This alpha field describes the type of the chiller-heater comprising this module set. Only the chiller-heater type ChillerHeaterPerformance:EIectric:EIR is currently available. Note that up to 20 sets of chiller-heater module name, schedule, and number of identical chiller-heater may be entered for a single central heat pump system.

#### Field: Chiller Heater Module Performance Component Name &lt;x&gt;

This alpha field is paired with the preceding chiller-heater module type to define the name of the module.

#### Field: Chiller Heater Module Control Schedule Name &lt;x&gt;

This alpha field is paired with the preceding chiller-heater module type and name to define its on/off control. This schedule will be used for all identical module components as defined in the next field. Currently, this schedule only controls the module set’s availability, i.e., schedule values equal to 1 indicate that the chiller-heater set is available while schedule values equal to 0 indicate that the chiller-heater set is off.

### ChillerHeaterPerformance:EIectric:EIR

The performance of the chiller-heater will be defined by two sets of curves meant to describe unloading for: 1) cooling-only mode, and 2) heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. Reference conditions must be defined for both because each has its own set of three unloading curves based on their associated reference conditions. The cooling-mode curves are typically (but not always) based on condenser entering water temperature while the heating-only mode curves are typically based on condenser leaving water temperature. This chiller-heater object allows the user to specify whether to use condenser leaving or condenser entering as a dependent variable to differentiate, if necessary, the condenser temperature basis used to generate the cooling- and heating-only mode curves.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name of the chiller-heater to be included in a central heat pump system.

#### Field: Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity

This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the evaporator in cooling mode in Watts. This value should be based on the reference temperatures and design water flow rates defined below. This field can be autosized.

#### Field: Reference Cooling Mode COP

This numeric field contains the reference coefficient of performance of the evaporator for cooling. It must be based on the values of Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and Reference Cooling Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature defined in the next two fields.

#### Field: Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference leaving chilled water temperature of the evaporator for cooling in Celsius. The default value is 6.67°C.

#### Field: Reference Cooling Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference entering condenser water temperature of the condenser in the cooling mode in Celsius. The default value is 29.4°C.

#### Field: Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Condenser Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference leaving condenser water temperature of the condenser in the cooling mode in Celsius. The default value is 35.0°C.

#### Field: Reference Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Ratio

This numeric field contains the evaporator’s capacity during the reference heating-only or simultaneous cooling-heating mode as a ratio of reference cooling capacity. For example, the ratio may be expressed as follows:

<div>\[Ratio = \frac{{EvapCapHt{g_{@Tchw,l = 6.67C,Tcond,l = 51.67C}}}}{{EvapCapC{{\lg }_{@Tchw,l = 6.67C,Tcond,l = 35.0C}}}}\]</div>

where Tchw,l is the leaving chilled water temperature and Tcond,l is the leaving condenser water temperature representing the heating-mode and cooling-mode reference temperatures defined elsewhere in this object.

The default is 0.75. This field is used to determine evaporator capacity in heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode, multiplying it by the value entered in the field of the Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity. Note that even when there is no cooling load, i.e., the machine is in heating-only mode, the evaporator must still run and extract heat from the source water. In heating-only mode, the leaving chilled water temperature (Tchw,l) may  float depending on the evaporator water flow rate and the source water temperature. In simultaneous cooling and heating mode, the leaving chilled water temperature (Tchw,l) does not float but is determined by the chilled water setpoint controls. For both heating-only and simultaneous cooling and heating mode, the leaving condenser temperature (Tcond,l) is determined by the hot water supply setpoint controls. This value of Tchw,l, combined with Tcond,l is plugged into the CAPFT and EIRFT curves to determine the off-rated heating-mode evaporator capacity and associated compressor power.

#### Field: Reference Heating Mode Cooling Power Ratio

This numeric field contains the compressor power during simultaneous cooling-heating mode as a ratio of reference cooling compressor power. For example, the ratio may be expressed as follows:

<div>\[Ratio = \frac{{Powe{r_{@Tchw,l = 6.67C,Tcond,l = 51.67C}}}}{{Powe{r_{@Tchw,l = 6.67C,Tcond,l = 35.0C}}}}\]</div>

The default value is 1.5. This field is used to determine full load compressor power at the simultaneous cooling-heating mode’s reference chilled water leaving and condenser water leaving temperatures. Note: In heating-only mode, the chilled water leaving temperature floats so the EIRFT curve is used to modify the simultaneouos cooling-heating full load compressor power value.

#### Field: Reference Heating Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference leaving chilled water temperature of the evaporator in simultaneous cooling-heating mode in Celsius. This is typically the same as the reference cooling mode value and is used to create the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode unloading curves. The leaving chilled water temperature for the chiller-heater is not allowed to fall below this value during the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode. The default value is 6.67°C.

#### Field: Reference Heating Mode Leaving Condenser Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference leaving condenser water temperature of the condenser in heating mode in Celsius. This field is typically controlled to the design hot water supply temperature, and used to create the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode unloading curves. The default value is 60.0°C.

#### Field: Reference Heating Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature

This numeric field contains the reference entering condenser water temperature of the condenser in heating mode in Celsius. This field typically represents the upper limit of the source water temperature. The default value is 29.44°C.

#### Field: Heating Mode Entering Chilled Water Temperature Low Limit

This numeric field contains the low limit of the entering chilled water temperature in heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode in Celsius. This field typically represents the lower limit of the source water temperature. If necessary, auxiliary heat will be activated to prevent source water temperature falling below the chilled water entering minimum. The default value is 12.2°C.

#### Field: Chilled Water Flow Mode Type

This alpha field contains the chilled water flow control mode. Valid water flow mode includes constant flow and variable flow, and the default water flow mode is constant flow.

#### Field: Design Chilled Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design chilled water flow rate in m<sup>3</sup>/s. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this field is autosizable.

#### Field: Design Condenser Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design condenser water flow rate in m<sup>3</sup>/s. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this field is autosizable.

#### Field: Design Hot Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design hot water flow rate in m<sup>3</sup>/s. The minimum value and default value for this field are zero, and this field is autosizable.

#### Field: Compressor Motor Efficiency

This numeric field contains the fraction of efficiency of the compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. This value must be between 0.0 and 1.0, and the default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Condenser Type

This alpha field contains the type of condenser. WaterCooled is the only valid type, and it requires the full specification of the condenser loop and its associated equipment.

#### Field: Cooling Mode Temperature Curve Condenser Water Independent Variable

This alpha field determines whether the entering or leaving condenser water temperature is used in the cooling mode unloading performance curves that follow. Valid variables include EnteringCondenser and LeavingCondenser, and the default variable is EnteringCondenser. The condenser temperature used for the cooling mode unloading performance curves will be dependent on this field input. For example, leaving condenser water temperature will be used when the LeavingCondenser is chosen, otherwise entering condenser water temperature.

#### Field: Cooling Mode Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the evaporator capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined in the previous field. It is then multiplied by the reference evaporator capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Cooling Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined by the user. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. It is then multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Cooling Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRFPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the available cooling capacity of the chiller-heater. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. Note that the bi-cubic formulation is generally only valid when LeavingCondenser variable is chosen for the field of Cooling Mode Condenser Water Temperature Curve Input Variable whereas the quadratic curve can be used both choices, i.e., LeavingCondenser and EnteringCondenser. The output of this curve is then multiplied by the reference full-load EIR and the EIRFT to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. The curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Cooling Mode Cooling Capacity Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller-heater’s optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the minimum part-load ratio, and less than or equal to the maximum part-load ratio. (Note: Both the minimum part-load ratio and maximum part-load ratio are taken from the Cooling Mode EIRFPLR curve definition.) The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Heating Mode Temperature Curve Condenser Water Independent Variable

This alpha field determines whether the entering or leaving condenser water temperature is used in the heating mode unloading performance curves that follow. Valid variables include EnteringCondenser and LeavingCondenser, and the default variable is EnteringCondenser. The condenser temperature used for the cooling mode unloading performance curves will be dependent on this field input. For example, leaving condenser water temperature will be used when the LeavingCondenser is chosen, otherwise entering condenser water temperature.

#### Field: Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the evaporator capacity in heating mode as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined in the previous field. This curve is used to evaluate the adjusted evaporator capacity during heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. This adjusted capacity is used as part of the cooling part-load calculation for the EIRFPLR curve. It is then multiplied by the reference evaporator capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Heating Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined by the user. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. It is then multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Heating Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRFPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual evaporator load divided by the available evaporator capacity of the chiller-heater at the reference heating and simultaneous cooling-heating mode temperatures. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. Note that the bicubic formulation below can only be used when the chiller-heater uses a variable speed compressor motor drive. It is also generally valid only when LeavingCondenser variable is chosen for the field of Cooling Mode Condenser Water Temperature Curve Input Variable whereas the quadratic curve can be used both choices, i.e., LeavingCondenser and EnteringCondenser. The output of this curve is then multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the EIRFT to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. The curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.

#### Field: Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Optimum Part Load Ratio

This numeric field contains the chiller-heater’s optimum part-load ratio during heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the minimum part-load ratio, and less than or equal to the maximum part-load ratio. (Note: Both the minimum part-load ratio and maximum part-load ratio are taken from the Heating Mode EIRFPLR curve definition.) The default value is 1.0.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The Sizing Factor is a multiplier on the design plant chilled water loop flow rate associated with the chiller-heaters parent CentralHeatPumpSystem object. The chiller-heater's modified chilled water flow can then be used to autocalculate the Design Condenser Water Flow Rate and Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity values. In general, it is best to autosize all three fields or set fixed values for all three fields.

Note that much of these output variables are adapted from the definitions above under “Generic Chiller Outputs” and “Electric EIR Chiller Outputs.” The following outputs are repeated up to the maximum of individual chiller-heater module objects. The maximum number may be different from the number of object defined in this object when users define two or more identical chiller-heater modules for a single chiller heater object in the central heat pump system.

#### Chiller Heater Operation Mode Unit &lt;x&gt; [  ]

This output represents the operating mode of the chiller-heater module. Two single mode outputs and three simultaneous cooling-heating mode outputs are possible:

0. off

1. cooling-only mode

2. heating-only mode

3. heat recovery mode

4. cooling dominant simultaneous cooling-heating mode

5. heating dominant simultaneous cooling-heating mode.

The first mode 0 is reported when the chiller-heater is turned off. The next two modes 2 and 3 are reported when the chiller-heater provides only either cooling or heating, respectively. The last three modes 3 to 5 indicate when the chiller-heater is in a simultaneous cooling-heating mode. Mode 3 indicates the chiller-heaters provides simultaneous cooling and heating ***without*** heat exchange with the ground source. Mode 4 denotes that at least one of the chiller-heater modules in the central heat pump system provides both cooling and heating, and the chiller-heater is meeting remaining cooling demand (see Figure 78. Diagram of a central heat pump system with one chiller-heater in heat recovery mode and two chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode) Similarly, mode 5 indicates that at least one of the chiller-heater modules in the central heat pump system is in the heat recovery mode, and the chiller-heater is meeting remaining heating demand (see Figure 79).

Note that the decision to operate individual chiller-heater modules is solely dependent on the chiller-heater schedule and loads. A fraction may appear in case the chiller-heater mode varies within a zone time step. In this particular case, users may define a detailed reporting frequency for this output variable.

#### Chiller Heater Part Load Ratio Unit &lt;x&gt; [  ]

This output is the ratio of the evaporator heat transfer rate plus the false load heat transfer rate (if applicable) to the available chiller-heater capacity. This value is used to determine ChillerEIRFPLR.

#### Chiller Heater Cycling Ratio Unit &lt;x&gt; [  ]

The cycling ratio is the amount of time the chiller-heater operates during each simulation time step. If the chiller-heater part-load ratio falls below the minimum part-load ratio, the chiller-heater cycles on and off to meet the loads.

#### Chiller Heater Cooling Electric Power Unit &lt;x&gt; [W]

#### Chiller Heater Cooling Electric Energy Unit &lt;x&gt; [J]

These outputs are the cooling electric power consumption of the chiller-heater.

#### Chiller Heater Heating Electric Power Unit &lt;x&gt; [W]

#### Chiller Heater Heating Electric Energy Unit &lt;x&gt; [J]

These outputs are the heating electric power consumption of the chiller-heater.

#### Chiller Heater Cooling Rate Unit &lt;x&gt; [W]

#### Chiller Heater Cooling Energy Unit &lt;x&gt; [J]

These outputs are the evaporator heat transfer which is the cooling delivered by the chiller-heater module.

#### Chiller Heater False Load Heat Transfer Rate Unit &lt;x&gt; [W]

#### Chiller Heater False Load Heat Transfer Energy Unit &lt;x&gt; [J]

These outputs are the heat transfer rate and total heat transfer due to false loading of the chiller-heater. When the chiller-heater part-load ratio is below the minimum unloading ratio, the chiller-heater false loads (e.g. hot-gas bypass) to further reduce capacity.

#### Chiller Heater Condenser Heat Transfer Rate Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

#### Chiller Heater Condenser Heat Transfer Energy Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

These outputs are the heat transfer which is the heating delivered by the chiller-heater module in heating mode.

#### Chiller Heater Evaporator Inlet Temperature Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

#### Chiller Heater Evaporator Outlet Temperature Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

#### Chiller Heater Evaporator Mass Flow Rate Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

These outputs are the evaporator water inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rate. Note that these represent the chilled water temperatures and flow rate in cooling mode or the source water temperature and flow rate in heating mode.

#### Chiller Heater Condenser Inlet Temperature Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

#### Chiller Heater Condenser Outlet Temperature Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

#### Chiller Heater Condenser Mass Flow Rate Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

These outputs are the condenser water inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rate. Note that these represent the hot water temperatures and flow rate in heating mode or the source water temperature and flow rate in cooling mode.

#### Chiller Heater COP Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

This output is the coefficient of performance for the chiller-heater. It is calculated as the evaporator heat transfer rate divided by the chiller-heater electric power.

#### Chiller Heater Capacity Temperature Modifier Multiplier Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

This is the output of the curve object Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve.

#### Chiller Heater EIR Temperature Modifier Multiplier Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve.

#### Chiller Heater EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier Unit &lt;x&gt; [C]

This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve.

### Thermal Storage Objects

There are four types of cold thermal storage objects:

- ThermalStorage:Ice:Simple

- ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed

- ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed

- ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified

These objects are typically placed on the supply side of a primary chilled water loop in series or in parallel with one or more chillers.  Using the the component set point (PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint) plant operation scheme type, the chiller and storage tank setpoints are used to control operation. Using a SetpointManager:Scheduled object (or other appropriate type of set point manager), the setpoints on the chiller outlet node and the ice storage outlet node can be used to control how the cooling load is shared and when charging of storage occurs.  Example setpoints to use for various modes of operation are shown in the table below:

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr>
<th>Mode</th>
<th>Chiller Setpoint</th>
<th>Storage Setpoint</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Charging ice storage tank</td>
<td>-5C</td>
<td>7C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cooling with chiller only</td>
<td>7C</td>
<td>99C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cooling with chiller and storage (fully load chiller before using storage))</td>
<td>7C</td>
<td>7C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cooling with chiller and storage (chiller carries portion of load, valid if chiller is upstream of storage)</td>
<td>10C</td>
<td>7C</td>
</tr>
</table>

Example files have been developed for three common storage configurations:

1. Series – Chiller Upstream:  In this configuration, a chiller is placed first on the same branch as the storage unit and both use the **SeriesActive** branch control type.

2. Series – Chiller Downstream:  In this configuration, a chiller is placed second on the same branch as the storage unit and both use the **SeriesActive** branch control type.

3. Parallel:  In this configuration, the chiller is on a branch parallel to the storage unit branch when it is not charging.  During charging mode, valves will be changed so that the chiller is in series upstream of the storage.  To accomplish this in EnergyPlus, the chiller must be modeled using two different chiller objects to represent the same chiller.  One chiller object on a parallel branch operates only when storage is not being charged.  The other chiller object, in series upstream of the storage unit operates only during charging mode.

Other considerations for applying cold thermal storage objects include:

- In the PlantLoop object, the "Minimum Loop Temperature" must be set equal to or less than the lowest setpoint to be used anywhere in the loop.

- To end the storage charging cycle, use a AvailabilityManager:LowTemperatureTurnOff to shut off the primary chilled water loop when the temperature leaving the storage tank nears the charging mode chiller setpoint indicating that the tank is fully charged.  For example, if the chiller is set to provide –5C chilled water during charging, then charging can be shut down when the water temperature leaving the storage unit reaches –4C.  When using a primary-secondary loop arrangement, it may be necessary to schedule this availability manager to be active only when the HVAC systems are off to avoid fighting between the demand controls and the availability manager.

### ThermalStorage:Ice:Simple

This thermal storage model is based on a simple simulation of an ice storage tank with a fixed capacity.  The tank is charged, or frozen, in an ice-on-coil configuration where ice builds up on the outside of the tubes carrying the brine or glycol solution from the chiller.  There are two discharge (melt) options, internal or external.  Internal melt uses the same fluid tubes for charging and discharging.  External melt uses a separate fluid path for discharge such that the outer layers of ice melt first.  The ice storage model includes an implied 3-way valve to control the amount if charge/discharge based on the incoming water temperature and the outlet node setpoint temperature.  The storage tank is assumed to be fully charged (full of ice) at the beginning of each environment.  The tank is then allowed to charge and discharge during the warmup days of the environment.  The tank is best controlled using the PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint plant operation scheme, and requires that a setpoint be placed by a set point manager on the ice storage Plant Outlet Node.

The input fields for the object are described in detail below:

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the ice storage tank.

#### Ice Thermal Storage Outlet Temperature [C]

The water temperature leaving the ice storage component.

### ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed

The detailed ice storage model allows the users of EnergyPlus to model more closely specific manufacturers’ ice storage units. This is possible due to the use of curve fits to simulate the performance of the ice storage unit during charging and discharging. In this implementation, both charging and discharging are a function of the fraction charged/discharged as well as the log mean temperature difference across the storage unit. More information on the model is provided in the Engineering Reference for EnergyPlus. The remainder of this section describes the input required for the detailed ice storage model and the output that it can produce.

#### Field: Name

This field is the name of the detailed ice storage system given to it by the user.

#### Field: Availability Schedule Name

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that determines whether or not the ice storage system is available during a particular time period. This allows the system to be turned off during a particular season. A value of less than or equal to zero indicates that the ice storage system is not available. Any value greater than zero indicates that the system is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Capacity

This number is the maximum amount of latent thermal storage available in the ice storage system. This model does not allow the removal or addition of sensible energy from the tank. Thus, it is always assumed to be at the freezing temperature of the storage material. The capacity is expressed in units of GJ.

#### Field: Inlet Node Name

This is the name of the node that connects the ice storage system to the plant loop. It is the inlet node to the ice storage component. The next field defines the outlet node. Due to presence of an internal bypass in this model, there are other “nodes” that are handled internally within the program. Users do not need to define any nodes other than the inlet and outlet nodes.

#### Field: Outlet Node Name

This is the name of the other node that connects the ice storage system to the plant loop. It is the outlet node to the ice storage component.

#### Field: Discharging Curve Object Type

The detailed ice storage model in EnergyPlus takes advantage of the Curve feature of the program. Currently, the only two allowed curve fit types for the detailed ice storage model are the QuadraticLinear and the CubicLinear curves. More information on this curve can be found in the section on Curves.

#### Field: Discharging Curve Name

This field specifies the name of the actual curve fit to be used to model the discharging process of the detailed ice storage system.

#### Field: Charging Curve Object Type

The detailed ice storage model in EnergyPlus takes advantage of the Curve feature of the program. Currently, the only two allowed curve fit types for the detailed ice storage model are the QuadraticLinear and the CubicLinear curves. More information on this curve can be found in the section on Curves.

#### Field: Charging Curve Name

This field specifies the name of the actual curve fit to be used to model the charging process of the detailed ice storage system.

#### Field: Timestep of the Curve Data

This field defines what timestep was used to produce the curve fits named in the previous inputs. This parameter is important because the curve fit is non-dimensional. Thus, the data used to develop the curve fits were based on a specific length of time. In many cases, this is probably one hour or 1.0. The units for this parameter are hours.

#### Field: Parasitic Electric Load During Discharging

This field defines the amount of parasitic electric consumption (for controls or other miscellaneous electric consumption associate with the ice storage unit itself) during the discharge phase. This parameter is dimensionless and gets multiplied by the current load on the tank.

#### Field: Parasitic Electric Load During Charging

This field defines the amount of parasitic electric consumption (for controls or other miscellaneous electric consumption associate with the ice storage unit itself) during the charge phase. This parameter is dimensionless and gets multiplied by the current load on the tank.

#### Field: Tank Loss Coefficient

This field defines the loss of ice stored during a particular hour. This field is dimensionless (per hour). It is not multiplied by any temperature difference between the tank and the environment in which it might be located.

#### Field: Freezing Temperature of Storage Medium

This parameter defines the freezing/melting temperature of the ice storage medium in degrees Celsius. For most tanks, this is simply 0.0°C (the default value). However, some tanks may use other materials or salts which would change the freezing temperature. This can be changed using this parameter.

#### Field: Thaw Process Indicator

This input field assists in more accurate modeling of the charging process by defining how the thawing of ice takes place. There are two options for this input: **InsideMelt** and **OutsideMelt**. Some ice storage systems, by their nature, start the charging process with a bare coil or no ice left on the charging surface even though there is still ice stored in the tank.  An example of such a system is sometimes referred to as an ice-on-coil inside melt system, and these systems would define this parameter using the “InsideMelt” option for this field.  Other systems melt the ice from the outside, leaving ice still on the charging surface when charging begins. These systems are modeled using the “OutsideMelt” option.  For systems that have a charging process that does not vary significantly with fraction charged can ignore this input by accepting the default value.  The default value for this field is “OutsideMelt”.

### ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed

The ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed object analytically solves the differential equation governing the energy balance of the water tank.  The chilled water is “used” by drawing from the “Use Side” of the water tank.  The tank is indirectly charged by circulating cold water through the “Source Side” of the water tank.

Control is based on cycling flow through the source side.  When the tank temperature rises above a “cut-in” temperature, source side flow is requested.  Source side flow will continue until the tank is cooled to below the tank set point or “cut-out” temperature.

For heat gains from the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, the skin gains are removed from the zone heat balance as negative internal heat gains.

#### Field: Name

The unique name of the ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed object.

#### Field: Tank Volume

The volume of the thermal storage tank [m<sup>3</sup>].

#### Field: Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name

#### Field: Nominal Cooling Capacity

This field describes the typical cooling capacity that the chilled water tank will provide.  Since this is a passive device, the actual cooling capacity depends on water temperatures and flow rates.  However, this field is used to describe the chilled water tank’s nominal cooling capacity for supervisory control where plant operation schemes require a cooling capacity to model how equipment is dispatched.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Indicator

The Ambient Temperature Indicator specifies how the ambient air temperature will be indicated. The field can be “Schedule”, “Zone”, or “Exterior.” If *Schedule* is used, the Ambient Temperature Schedule Name field provides the values for ambient temperature.

If the effectiveness is set to 1 then complete heat transfer occurs, simulating perfect mixing of the use side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is lower, then the use side outlet water temperature will not be as cold as the tank water, simulating a heat exchanger.

#### Field: Use Side Availability Schedule Name

This field contains the name of an availability schedule for the use side of the water tank. If the schedule’s value is 0.0, then the use side is not available and flow will not be requested.  If the schedule’s value is note equal to 0.0 (usually 1 is used), the use side is available.

#### Field: Source Side Inlet Node Name

The inlet node connection to the plant loop for the source side of the chilled water storage tank. Typically the source side draws somewhat warm water from the tank and returns colder water.  The source side volume flow rate is obtained from the plant loop.  The magnitude of the flow rates through the source side can be controlled by setting the Maximum Branch Flow Rate field in the BRANCH object that connects the source inlet node.

#### Field: Source Side Outlet Node Name

The outlet node connection to the plant loop for the source side of the chilled water storage tank. Typically the source side draws somewhat warm water from the tank and returns colder water.

If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Source Side Design Flow Rate

This field is used to specify the design flow rate through the Source Side of the chilled water tank.  The volumetric design flow rate is specified in m<sup>3</sup>/s.  The field can be autosized.  If autosized, then the input file should include a Plant Sizing object for the plant loop.  Sizing results are reported in the EIO file.

### ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified

The ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified object divides the water tank into multiple nodes of equal volume. The nodes are coupled by vertical conduction effects, internode fluid flow, and temperature inversion mixing. The object simultaneously solves the differential equations governing the energy balances on the nodes using a numerical method. The system timestep is divided into many small substeps that allow the simulation to capture events that occur on a very short time scale.  The chilled water is “used” by drawing from the “Use Side” of the water tank.  The tank is indirectly charged by circulating cold water through the “Source Side” of the water tank.

Control is based on cycling flow through the source side.  When the tank temperature rises above a “cut-in” temperature, source side flow is requested.  Source side flow will continue until the tank is cooled to below the tank set point or “cut-out” temperature.

For heat gains from the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, the skin gains are removed from the zone heat balance as negative internal heat gains.

#### Field: Name

The unique name of the ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified object.

#### Field: Tank Volume

The volume of the thermal storage tank [m<sup>3</sup>].

#### Field: Tank Height

The height [m] of the tank. For the HorizontalCylinder shape (see below) the height of the tank is the measure in the axial direction, i.e., the height if you were to stand the cylinder up on its end.

#### Field: Tank Shape

The tank shape determines the size and skin losses of the stratified nodes. There are three options:  “VerticalCylinder,” “HorizontalCylinder,” and “Other.”

*VerticalCylinder* describes most upright cylindrical water tanks.

*HorizontalCylinder* describes a few specialty water tanks and some large commercial storage tanks. *HorizontalCylinder* implies that the tank is divided into nodes of equal mass, but not equal height.

*Other* describes water storage tanks that have a uniform horizontal cross-section, but are not cylinders, e.g., a cuboid or other shape. The length of the perimeter is then specified by the Tank Perimeter field.

#### Field: Tank Perimeter

#### Field: Temperature Sensor Height

This field is used to describe the location in the tank where the temperature is sensed for control descisions.  The program will associate one of the nodes with this height and use that node’s temperature for control decisions.  The location is described in meters from the bottom of the tank.

#### Field: Minimum Temperature Limit

The temperature [°C] at which the tank water becomes too cold.  No source side flow is allowed when the tank temperature is below this limit.  The minimum temperature must be lower than the setpoint temperature at all times.

#### Field: Nominal Cooling Capacity

This field describes the typical cooling capacity that the chilled water tank will provide.  Since this is a passive device, the actual cooling capacity depends on water temperatures and flow rates.  However, this field is used to describe the chilled water tank’s nominal cooling capacity for supervisory control where plant operation schemes require a cooling capacity to model how equipment is dispatched.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Indicator

If *Exterior* is used, the outdoor dry-bulb air temperature provides the ambient temperature.

This field is applicable only when the Ambient Temperature Indicator is specified as *Exterior*, otherwise this field should be left blank. The node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

#### Field: Uniform Skin Loss Coefficient per Unit Area to Ambient Temperature

The uniform skin loss coefficient [W/m<sup>2</sup>-K] or U-Value of the tank to the ambient air temperature. The uniform skin loss accounts for the tank insulation.

If the effectiveness is set to 1 then complete heat transfer occurs, simulating perfect mixing of the use side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is lower, then the use side outlet water temperature will not be as cold as the tank water, simulating a heat exchanger.

#### Field: Use Side Availability Schedule Name

This field contains the name of an availability schedule for the use side of the water tank.  If the schedule’s value is 0.0, then the use side is not available and flow will not be requested.  If the schedule’s value is not equal to 0.0 (usually 1 is used), then the use side is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Use Side Inlet Height

The height of the use side inlet to the tank. If blank, the inlet defaults to the top of the tank. The inlet height cannot be higher than the tank height.

#### Field: Use Side Outlet Height

The height of the use side outlet from the tank. If blank or **autocalculate**, the inlet defaults to the bottom of the tank. The outlet height cannot be higher than the tank height.

#### Field: Use Side Design Flow Rate

This field is used to specify the design flow rate through the Use Side of the water tank.  The volumetric design flow rate is specified in m<sup>3</sup>/s.  The field is needed when the Use Side is connected to a plant loop.  The field can be autosized.  If autosized, then the input file should include a Plant Sizing object for the plant loop.  Sizing results are reported in the EIO file.

#### Field: Source Side Inlet Node Name

The inlet node connection to the plant loop for the source side of the chilled water storage tank. Typically the source side draws somewhat warm water from the tank and returns colder water.  The source side volume flow rate is obtained from the plant loop.  The magnitude of the flow rates through the source side can be controlled by setting the Maximum Branch Flow Rate field in the BRANCH object that connects the source inlet node.

#### Field: Source Side Outlet Node Name

The outlet node connection to the plant loop for the source side of the chilled water storage tank. Typically the source side draws somewhat warm water from the tank and returns colder water.

#### Field: Source Side Heat Transfer Effectiveness

This field specifies the heat transfer effectiveness between the source side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is set to 1 then complete heat transfer occurs, simulating perfect mixing of the source side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is less than 1.0, then the source side outlet water temperature will be less than the tank water at the outlet node, simulating a heat exchanger.

#### Field: Source Side Availability Schedule Name

This field contains the name of an availability schedule for the source side of the water tank.  If the schedule’s value is 0.0, then the source side is not available and flow will not be requested. If the schedule’s value is not equal to 0.0 (usually 1 is used), then the source side is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Source Side Inlet Height

The height of the source side inlet to the tank. If blank or **autocalculate**, the inlet defaults to the bottom of the tank. The inlet height cannot be higher than the tank height.

#### Field: Source Side Outlet Height

The height of the source side outlet from the tank. If blank, the inlet defaults to the top of the tank. The outlet height cannot be higher than the tank height.

#### Field: Source Side Design Flow Rate

This field is optional and is used to specify the design flow rate through the Source Side of the water heater.  The volumetric design flow rate is specified in m<sup>3</sup>/s.  The field is needed when the Source Side is connected to a plant loop.  The field can be autosized.  If autosized, then the input file should include a Plant Sizing object for the plant loop.  Sizing results are reported in the EIO file.

#### Field: Tank Recovery Time

This field is used to autosize the Source Side Design Flow Rate.  The field is used if the previous field is set to autosize and the water tank’s source side is on the demand side of a plant loop.  This the the time, in hours, that the chilled water tank is to be indirectly cooled from 14.4C to 9.0C using the exit temperature of in the associated Plant Sizing object.

#### Field: Inlet Mode

The inlet mode of entering fluid from the use and source sides. There are two options:  “Fixed” or “Seeking.” In *Fixed* mode, the fluid enters at the fixed heights specified above. In *Seeking* mode, the fluid "seeks out" the stratified node that is closest to the inlet temperature and adds all flow to that node. The *Seeking* mode provides maximum stratification.

#### Field: Number of Nodes

The number of stratified nodes in the tank. There must be at least one node. The maximum number of nodes is 10, although this limit can be increased by editing the IDD.

#### Field: Additional Destratification Conductivity

An additional destratification conductivity [W/m-K] is added to the fluid conductivity of water (0.6 W/m-K) to account for vertical conduction effects along the inside of the tank wall, and perhaps other vertical components such as a dip tube pipe or anode rod.

#### Field: Node 1-10 Additional Loss Coefficient

An additional heat gain coefficient [W/K] added to the skin gains for a given node to account for thermal shorting due to pipe penetrations, tank feet, and any other loss effects.

Group – Water Heaters
---------------------

Water heater objects are components for storing and heating water. They can be coupled to a plant loop simulation or used stand-alone. Typical water heater applications are for domestic hot water heating, low-temperature radiant space heating, and energy storage for solar hot water systems or waste heat recovery.

When coupled to the plant loop, the water heater has an inlet node and outlet node on the "source side" and an inlet node and outlet node on the "use side". The source side typically draws cold water from the tank and returns warmer water, for instance, from solar hot water systems or waste heat recovery systems. The use side typically draws hot water from the tank and returns cooler water from the cold water supply mains or from the outlet of a heating system. The distinction between source and use sides is merely a convenience for reporting. They can actually be used interchangeably. If so desired, either source side or use side can be used by itself, without the other side being connected to the plant loop.

However, for a water heater that is indirectly heated (e.g. with a separate boiler), the source side can be used to provide remotely heated water to the tank.  The source side is configured to operate as a component on the demand side of a plant loop.  The design flow rate through the source side can be set by the user or autosized.  If autosized, then a Plant Sizing object is needed elsewhere in the input file for the Plant Loop serving the source side.  The water heater input includes an additional design parameter that describes how rapidly the tank can recover.

![WHFig](media/image191.png)

Figure 80. Water Heater Configuration

If the use side only consists of domestic hot water usage, a simple scheduled use flow rate can be specified in lieu of the full plant loop connections. The scheduled use flow rate can be used simultaneously with source side plant connections, but cannot be used with use side plant connections.

For stand-alone operation, there are no node connections to the plant loop on either source or use sides. The scheduled use flow rate determines all fluid exchange with the water tank.

There are currently two water heater objects in EnergyPlus:

- WaterHeater:Mixed

- WaterHeater:Stratified

There are also compound objects that uses the WaterHeater:Mixed and/or WaterHeater:Stratified as part of their strategy:

- WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser (WaterHeater:Mixed or WaterHeater:Stratified)
- WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser (WaterHeater:Stratified only)

The WaterHeater:Mixed object simulates a well-mixed, single-node water tank. The WaterHeater:Stratified object simulates a stratified, multi-node water tank. Both water heater objects can be appropriate for simulating many types of water heaters and storage tanks, including gas and electric residential water heaters, and a variety of large commercial water heaters. Both objects share similar features, such as stand-alone operation, on- and off-cycle parasitic loads, and thermal losses to the zone. However, each object has its advantages which may make one water heater object more appropriate than the other depending on the application.

Advantages of **WaterHeater:Mixed**:

- can simulate instantaneous/tankless water heaters

- requires less input than the stratified tank

- faster execution time than the stratified tank

- adequate for modeling gas water heaters with no source connections.

Advantages of **WaterHeater:Stratified**:

- better modeling of electric water heaters with two heating elements

- better modeling of thermal storage applications which rely on stratification to improve heat transfer peformance.

### Standard Ratings

The EIO file reports the industry standard ratings of Recovery Efficiency and Energy Factor for water heater objects. The rating method is based on the GAMA and 10CFR430 test procedures. Under certain input parameters, the rating method will not succeed and a warning message will be generated. Problems occur when inputs do not allow the tank to recover to the setpoint temperature within the test period. This can occur if the maximum heater capacity is undersized, or if the deadband temperature difference is large enough that the first draw of the test does not trigger the heater to come on. In either case, the Recovery Efficiency test will not compute properly because recovery to the setpoint was not achieved.

Standard ratings for storage-only water tanks (Heater Maximum Capacity = 0) cannot be calculated and do not report anything in the EIO file.

### WaterHeater:Mixed

The WaterHeater:Mixed object analytically solves the differential equation governing the energy balance of the water tank. Within a timestep, conditions are solved separately for when the heater element or burner is "on" (on-cycle) and when it is "off" (off-cycle). This approach allows ambient losses and parasitic loads to be divided into on-cycle and off-cycle effects and accounted for in detail.

For losses to the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, a fraction of the skin losses can be added to the zone heat balance as internal heat gains.

Control options allow the heater to cycle or modulate to meet the load. When cycling, the heater element or burner is either on or off. The heater remains fully on while heating the tank up to the setpoint temperature. When the setpoint is reached, the heater turns off. The heater remains off until the tank temperature falls below the "cut-in" temperature, i.e., the setpoint temperature minus the deadband temperature difference. The heater continuously cycles on and off to maintain the tank temperature within the deadband. Most storage-tank water heaters cycle.

When modulating, the heater power varies between the maximum and minimum heater capacities. The heater stays on as long as the required total demand is above the minimum capacity. Below the minimum capacity, the heater will begin to cycle on and off based on the deadband temperature difference. Equipment is usually designed and rated to avoid this condition. Most tankless/instantaneous water heaters modulate.

#### Field: Name

The name of the WaterHeater:Mixed object.

#### Field: Tank Volume

The volume of the storage tank [m<sup>3</sup>].  This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.  Although this field is allowed to go down to zero, even so-called "tankless" water heaters have some volume of water that is maintained around the heating elements or in the heat exchanger, typically around 0.00379 m<sup>3</sup> (1 gallon).

#### Field: Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name

The reference to the schedule object specifying the hot water temperature setpoint [°C]. Also known as the "cut-out" temperature.

#### Field: Deadband Temperature Difference

The delta temperature difference [Δ°C] between the setpoint and the "cut-in" temperature at which the heater will turn on. In other words, the "cut-in" temperature is Setpoint – Deadband.

#### Field: Maximum Temperature Limit

The temperature [°C] at which the tank water becomes dangerously hot and is vented through boiling or an automatic safety. The tank temperature will never exceed the maximum. Any extra heat added to the tank is immediately vented. Note:  The maximum temperature must be greater than the setpoint temperature at all times.

#### Field: Heater Control Type

The control type can be **Cycle** or **Modulate**. Cycle is appropriate for most storage tank-type water heaters. Modulate is appropriate for most instantaneous/tankless water heaters.

#### Field: Heater Maximum Capacity

The maximum heat rate [W] that can be supplied to the water, probably the same as the "nominal" capacity.  This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.

#### Field: Heater Minimum Capacity

The minimum heat rate [W] that can be supplied to the water. This field is only used when the Heater Control Type is **Modulate**. If the total demand rate for heating is less than the minimum, even a modulating water heater will begin to cycle.

#### Field: Heater Ignition Minimum Flow Rate

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

#### Field: Heater Ignition Delay

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

#### Field: Heater Fuel Type

The type of fuel used for heating. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or DistrictHeating.

#### Field: Heater Thermal Efficiency

The thermal conversion efficiency from fuel energy to heat energy for the heater element or burner. This is not the same as the overall efficiency of the water heater.

#### Field: Part Load Factor Curve Name

The reference to the curve object that relates the overall efficiency of the water heater to the Runtime Fraction (if Control Type **Cycle**) or Part Load Ratio (if Control Type **Modulate**). This is an additional multiplier applied to the Heater Thermal Efficiency to compute fuel energy use. The Part Load Factor Curve should not have a value less than 0.1 in the domain from 0 to 1. If the Part Load Factor Curve accounts for ambient losses and/or parasitic fuel consumption, these effects should not also be input into the related fields in this object as that would result in double-counting.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Consumption Rate

Off-cycle parasitics include parts of the water heater that consume fuel when the heater is off, for example, a pilot light, or stand-by electronic control circuits. The fuel consumption rate [W] is strictly the total fuel that is consumed by all of the off-cycle parasitics.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Type

The type of fuel used by the off-cycle parasitics. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or DistrictHeating. The fuel type can be the same or different from the Heater Fuel Type.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Heat Fraction to Tank

The fraction of off-cycle parasitic fuel energy that is converted to heat energy that ends up in the tank water. For example, a pilot light would deliver most of its heat to the tank water, as long as the thermal conversion efficiency must be taken into account, so perhaps 0.80 is reasonable. Electronic control circuits, on the other hand, do not add any heat to the tank and should be 0.

#### Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Consumption Rate

On-cycle parasitics include parts of the water heater that consume fuel when the heater is on, for example, an induction fan, or stand-by electronic control circuits. The fuel consumption rate [W] is strictly the total fuel that is consumed by all of the on-cycle parasitics.

#### Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Type

The type of fuel used by the on-cycle parasitics. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or DistrictHeating. The fuel type can be the same or different from the Heater Fuel Type.

#### Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Heat Fraction to Tank

The fraction of on-cycle parasitic fuel energy that is converted to heat energy that ends up in the tank water. For example, an induction fan might (maybe) deliver a small fraction of its energy to the tank water for a value of 0.05. Electronic control circuits, on the other hand, do not add any heat to the tank and should be 0.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Indicator

The Ambient Temperature Indicator specifies how the ambient air temperature will be indicated. The field can be **Schedule**, **Zone**, or **Outdoors**. If **Schedule** is used, the Ambient Temperature Schedule field provides the ambient temperature. If **Zone** is used, the zone air temperature of the zone specified in the Ambient Temperature Zone field provides the ambient temperature. If **Outdoors** is used, the outdoor dry-bulb air temperature provides the ambient temperature.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Schedule Name

The reference to the schedule object specifying the ambient air temperature around the tank for skin losses. This field is only used if Ambient Temperature Indicator is **Schedule**.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Zone Name

The reference to the zone object specifying the ambient air temperature around the tank for skin losses. This field is only used if Ambient Temperature Indicator is **Zone**.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Outdoor Air Node Name

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the ambient conditions surrounding the water heater tank. This field is applicable only when the Ambient Temperature Indicator is specified as **Outdoors**, otherwise this field should be left blank. The node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Loss Coefficient to Ambient Temperature

The loss coefficient [W/K] to the ambient air temperature. Often this coefficient is identical to the "UA" for skin losses. However, it can also be used to model the loss effects of the flue in a combustion water heater, in addition to the skin losses.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Loss Fraction to Zone

If the Ambient Temperature Indicator is **Zone**, this field adds the specified fraction of the off-cycle losses to the zone heat balance as an internal gain.

#### Field: On-Cycle Loss Coefficient to Ambient Temperature

The loss coefficient [W/K] to the ambient air temperature. Often this coefficient is identical to the "UA" for skin losses. If the loss effects of the flue are being modeled in the Off-Cycle Loss Coefficient, than this field would have a different value accounting only for the skin losses.

#### Field: On-Cycle Loss Fraction to Zone

If the Ambient Temperature Indicator is **Zone**, this field adds the specified fraction of the on-cycle losses to the zone heat balance as an internal gain.

#### Field: Peak Use Flow Rate

The peak flow rate [m<sup>3</sup>/s] of domestic hot water usage for stand-alone operation, i.e., without plant loop node connections. The peak value is multiplied by the Use Flow Rate Fraction Schedule. If there are node connections, this field is not used.

#### Field: Use Flow Rate Fraction Schedule Name

The reference to the schedule object specifiying the current fraction of Peak Volumetric Use Flow Rate of domestic hot water usage for stand-alone operation.

#### Field: Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name

The reference to the schedule object specifying the cold water temperature [°C] from the supply mains that makes up for the hot water lost down the drain. If blank, water temperatures are calculated by the Site:WaterMainsTemperature object. This field is for stand-alone operation only. If there are node connections, this field is not used.

#### Field: Use Side Inlet Node Name

The inlet node connection to the plant loop for the use side of the water heater. Typically the use side draws hot water from the tank and returns cooler water.

#### Field: Use Side Outlet Node Name

The outlet node connection to the plant loop for the use side of the water heater. Typically the use side draws hot water from the tank and returns cooler water.

#### Field: Use Side Effectiveness

This field specifies the heat transfer effectiveness between the use side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is set to 1 then complete heat transfer occurs, simulating perfect mixing of the use side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is lower, then the use side outlet water temperature will not be as hot as the tank water, simulating a heat exchanger.

#### Field: Source Side Inlet Node Name

The inlet node connection to the plant loop for the source side of the water heater. Typically the source side draws cold water from the tank and returns warmer water.  The source side volume flow rate is obtained from the plant loop.  The magnitude of the flow rates through the source side can be controlled by setting the Maximum Branch Flow Rate field in the **Branch** object that connects the source inlet node.

#### Field: Source Side Outlet Node Name

The outlet node connection to the plant loop for the source side of the water heater. Typically the source side draws cold water from the tank and returns warmer water.

#### Field: Source Side Effectiveness

This field specifies the heat transfer effectiveness between the source side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is set to 1 then complete heat transfer occurs, simulating perfect mixing of the source side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is lower, then the source side outlet water temperature will not be as hot as the tank water, simulating a heat exchanger.

#### Field: Use Side Design Flow Rate

This field is optional and is used to specify the design flow rate through the Use Side of the water heater.  The volumetric design flow rate is specified in m<sup>3</sup>/s.  The field is needed when the Use Side is connected to a plant loop.  The field can be autosized.  If autosized, then the input file should include a Plant Sizing object for the plant loop.  Sizing results are reported in the EIO file.

#### Field: Source Side Design Flow Rate

This field is optional and is used to specify the design flow rate through the Source Side of the water heater.  The volumetric design flow rate is specified in m<sup>3</sup>/s.  The field is needed when the Source Side is connected to a plant loop.  The field can be autosized.  If autosized, then the input file should include a Plant Sizing object for the plant loop.  Sizing results are reported in the EIO file.

#### Field: Indirect Water Heating Recovery Time

This field is optional and is used to provide a design parameter for autosizing design flow rates when the water heater is connected to the demand side of a plant loop.  The recovery time is expressed in hours.  This is the time that the entire volume of the tank can be heated from 14.4ºC to 57.2ºC (58ºF to 135ºF) with an inlet temperature defined as the exit temperature in the associated Plant Sizing object.  The default is 1.5 hours.  The calculation is based on log-mean temperature difference (LMTD) and includes the heat transfer effectiveness factor entered above.

#### Field: Source Side Flow Control Mode

This field is optional and is used to provide control over the logic used by the source side of the water heater to request flow. There are three choices for different modes: IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint, IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint, or StorageTank.    The mode called IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint is the historical behavior prior to version 8.1.  In this mode the water heater will request flow at the source side when the main setpoint, in the input field called Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name, and deadband call for the tank to be heated.  This mode is typical for a water heater indirectly heated by a boiler.  The mode called IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint is similar but it bases its control decisions on an alternate setpoint given in the following field.  This mode is useful when the indirect source of heat may not satisfy the load and an internal heater is used for backup.  The mode called StorageTank is for a passive tank and it always requests flow unless the tank temperature is equal to or higher than the maximum limit given in the input field called Maximum Temperature Limit.

#### Field: Indirect Alternate Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name

This field is optional and is used to provide a schedule with alternate setpoints for use with the IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint mode in the previous field.  The input field should contain a reference to a schedule object specifying the hot water temperature setpoint [°C] to use as the "cut-out" temperature for control logic at the source side.

### WaterHeater:Stratified

The WaterHeater:Stratified object divides the water tank into multiple nodes of equal volume. The nodes are coupled by vertical conduction effects, internode fluid flow, and temperature inversion mixing. The object simultaneously solves the differential equations governing the energy balances on the nodes using a numerical method. The system timestep is divided into many small substeps that allow the simulation to capture events that occur on a very short time scale. This approach allows ambient losses and parasitic loads to be divided into on-cycle and off-cycle effects and accounted for in detail.

For losses to the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, a fraction of the skin losses can be added to the zone heat balance as internal heat gains.

The WaterHeater:Stratified object allows two heating elements to be simulated. The two elements can cycle on and off to maintain the node temperature within the deadband. The Heater Priority Control field determines how the heaters work together. There are two options:  MasterSlave or Simultaneous. In the MasterSlave option, Heater 1 is the master and Heater 2 is the slave. That is, both heaters are not allowed to turn on at the same time. If the thermostats ask for heat at both Heater 1 and 2, only Heater 1 will turn on. Once Heater 1 has met the set point, it turns off and Heater 2 can turn on, if necessary. In the Simultaneousoption, Heater 1 and Heater 2 can turn on and off independently.  Autosizing is available for only Heater 1.

#### Field: Name

The name of the WaterHeater:Stratified object.

#### Field: End-Use Subcategory

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., "Laundry", "Dish Washing", etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory  (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table under the "Water Systems" end-use category. If this field is omitted or blank, the water use will be assigned to the "General" end-use subcategory.

#### Field: Tank Volume

The actual volume [m3] of fluid in the tank. This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.  The actual volume is typically not equal to the nominal volume specified by the manufacturer. Actual volume is almost always 10% lower for electric water heaters, and 5% lower for gas water heaters (Burch and Erickson 2004).

Burch, J., and P. Erickson. 2004. "Using Ratings Data to Derive Simulation-Model Inputs for Storage-Tank Water Heaters". *Proceedings of the Solar 2004 Conference, 11-14 July 2004, Portland, Oregon*, American Solar Energy Society (ASES), pp. 393-398.

#### Field: Tank Height

The height [m] of the tank. For the **HorizontalCylinder** shape (see below) the height of the tank is the measure in the axial direction, i.e., the height if you were to stand the cylinder up on its end. This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.

#### Field: Tank Shape

The tank shape determines the size and skin losses of the stratified nodes. There are three options:  **VerticalCylinder**, **HorizontalCylinder**, and **Other**.

**VerticalCylinder** describes most upright residential water heaters.

HorizontalCylinder describes a few specialty water heaters and large commercial storage tanks. HorizontalCylinder can also be used to model an outdoor storage tank located above a solar collector in a thermosiphon configuration. HorizontalCylinder implies that the tank is divided into nodes of equal mass, but not equal height.

Other describes water heaters or storage tanks that have a uniform horizontal cross-section, but are not cylinders, e.g., a cuboid or other shape. The length of the perimeter is then specified by the Tank Perimeter field.

If blank, the default shape is **VerticalCylinder**.

#### Field: Tank Perimeter

The length of the tank perimeter [m]. This field is only used if Tank Shape is **Other**.

#### Field: Maximum Temperature Limit

The temperature [°C] at which the tank water becomes dangerously hot and is vented through boiling or an automatic safety. The tank temperature will never exceed the maximum. Any extra heat added to the tank is immediately vented. Note:  The maximum temperature must be greater than the setpoint temperature at all times.

#### Field: Heater Priority Control

The heater priority control determines how Heater 1 and Heater 2 work together. There are two options:  **MasterSlave** or **Simultaneous**. In the MasterSlave option, Heater 1 is the master and Heater 2 is the slave. In most residential electric water heaters, the heaters operate in a MasterSlave relationship. That is, both heaters are not allowed to turn on at the same time. If the thermostats ask for heat at both Heater 1 and 2, only Heater 1 will turn on. Once Heater 1 has met the set point, it turns off and Heater 2 can turn on, if necessary. In other words, only one heater can be on at any time, and Heater 1 is always has priority over Heater 2.

In the Simultaneous option, Heater 1 and Heater 2 can turn on and off independently.

If blank, the default is **MasterSlave**.

#### Field: Heater 1 Set Point Temperature Schedule Name

#### Field: Heater 1 Height

The height [m] of Heater 1 in the tank.

#### Field: Heater 2 Set Point Temperature Schedule Name

The reference to the schedule object specifying the hot water temperature set point [°C] for Heater 2. Also known as the "cut-out" temperature.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Consumption Rate

Off-cycle parasitics include parts of the water heater that consume fuel when the heater is off, for example, a pilot light, or stand-by electronic control circuits. The fuel consumption rate [W] is strictly the total fuel that is consumed by all of the off-cycle parasitics.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Type

The type of fuel used by the off-cycle parasitics. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or DistrictHeating. The fuel type can be the same or different from the Heater Fuel Type.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Heat Fraction to Tank

The fraction of off-cycle parasitic fuel energy that is converted to heat energy that ends up in the tank water. For example, a pilot light would deliver most of its heat to the tank water, as long as the thermal conversion efficiency must be taken into account, so perhaps 0.80 is reasonable. Electronic control circuits, on the other hand, do not add any heat to the tank and should be 0.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Height

The height [m] where any off-cycle parasitic heat gains are added to the tank.

#### Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Consumption Rate

On-cycle parasitics include parts of the water heater that consume fuel when the heater is on, for example, an induction fan, or stand-by electronic control circuits. The fuel consumption rate [W] is strictly the total fuel that is consumed by all of the on-cycle parasitics.

#### Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Type

The type of fuel used by the on-cycle parasitics. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or DistrictHeating. The fuel type can be the same or different from the Heater Fuel Type.

#### Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Heat Fraction to Tank

The fraction of on-cycle parasitic fuel energy that is converted to heat energy that ends up in the tank water. For example, an induction fan might (maybe) deliver a small fraction of its energy to the tank water for a value of 0.05. Electronic control circuits, on the other hand, do not add any heat to the tank and should be 0.

#### Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Height

The height [m] where any on-cycle parasitic heat gains are added to the tank.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Indicator

The Ambient Temperature Indicator specifies how the ambient air temperature will be indicated. The field can be **Schedule**, **Zone**, or **Outdoors**. If **Schedule** is used, the Ambient Temperature Schedule value provides the ambient temperature. If **Zone** is used, the zone air temperature of the zone specified in the Ambient Temperature Zone field provides the ambient temperature. If **Outdoors** is used, the outdoor dry-bulb air temperature of the outdoor air node specified in the Ambient Temperature OutdoorAir:Node field provides the ambient temperature.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Schedule Name

The reference to the zone object specifying the ambient air temperature around the tank for skin losses. This field is only used if Ambient Temperature Indicator is **Zone**.

#### Field: Ambient Temperature Outdoor Air Node

#### Field: Uniform Skin Loss Coefficient Per Unit Area to Ambient Temperature

The uniform skin loss coefficient [W/m2-K] or U-Value of the tank to the ambient air temperature. The uniform skin loss accounts for the tank insulation and applies during both off- and on-cycle operation. The overall losses at any particular node can be further modified using the Additional Loss Coefficient fields to account for thermal shorting due to pipe penetrations, water heater feet, and any other loss effects.

#### Field: Skin Loss Fraction to Zone

If the Ambient Temperature Indicator is **Zone**, this field adds the specified fraction of the skin losses to the zone heat balance as an internal gain.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Flue Loss Coefficient to Ambient Temperature

The off-cycle flue loss coefficient [W/K] to the ambient air temperature. This field mainly applies to gas water heaters that have a flue.

#### Field: Off-Cycle Flue Loss Fraction to Zone

If the Ambient Temperature Indicator is **Zone**, this field adds the specified fraction of the off-cycle flue losses to the zone heat balance as an internal gain.

#### Field: Peak Use Flow Rate

The peak flow rate [m<sup>3</sup>/s] of domestic hot water usage for stand-alone operation, i.e., without plant loop node connections. The peak value is multiplied by the Use Flow Rate Fraction Schedule. If there are node connections, this field is not used.

If blank, water temperatures are calculated by the Site:WaterMainsTemperature object. This field is for stand-alone operation only. If there are node connections, this field is not used.

#### Field: Use Side Inlet Node Name

#### Field: Use Side Effectiveness

This field specifies the heat transfer effectiveness between the use side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is set to 1 then complete heat transfer occurs, simulating perfect mixing of the use side water and the tank water.

#### Field: Use Side Inlet Height

The height of the use side inlet to the tank. If blank, the inlet defaults to the bottom of the tank. The inlet height cannot be higher than the tank height.

#### Field: Use Side Outlet Height

The height of the source side outlet from the tank. If blank, the inlet defaults to the bottom of the tank. The outlet height cannot be higher than the tank height.

#### Field: Inlet Mode

The inlet mode of entering fluid from the use and source sides. There are two options:  **Fixed** or **Seeking**. In Fixed mode, the fluid enters at the fixed heights specified above. In Seeking mode, the fluid "seeks out" the stratified node that is closest to the inlet temperature and adds all flow to that node. The Seekingbmode provides maximum stratification. The default is **Fixed**.

#### Field: Use Side Design Flow Rate

This field is optional and is used to specify the design flow rate through the Use Side of the water heater.  The volumetric design flow rate is specified in m<sup>3</sup>/s.  The field is needed when the Use Side is connected to a plant loop.  The field can be autosized.  If autosized, then the input file should include a Plant Sizing object for the plant loop.  Sizing results are reported in the EIO file.

#### Field: Source Side Design Flow Rate

#### Field: Indirect Water Heating Recovery Time

This field is optional and is used to provide a design parameter for autosizing design flow rates when the water heater is connected to the demand side of a plant loop.  The recovery time is expressed in hours.  This is the time that the entire volume of the tank can be heated from 14.4ºC to 57.2ºC (58ºF to 135ºF) with an inlet temperature defined as the exit temperature in the associated Plant Sizing object.  The default is 1.5 hours.  The calculation is based on log-mean temperature difference (LMTD) and includes the heat transfer effectiveness factor entered above.

#### Field: Number Of Nodes

The number of stratified nodes in the tank. There must be at least one node. The maximum number of nodes is 12, although this limit can be increased by editing the IDD.

#### Field: Additional Destratification Conductivity

An additional destratification conductivity [W/m-K] is added to the fluid conductivity of water (0.6 W/m-K) to account for vertical conduction effects along the inside of the tank wall, and perhaps other vertical components such as the flue, the cold water inlet pipe (dip tube), and the anode rod.

#### Field: Node 1-12 Additional Loss Coefficient

#### Field: Source Side Flow Control Mode

This field is optional and is used to provide control over the logic used by the source side of the water heater to request flow. There are three choices for different modes: IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint, IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint, or StorageTank.    The mode called IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint is the historical behavior prior to version 8.1.  In this mode the water heater will request flow at the source side when the main setpoint, in the input field called Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name, and deadband call for the tank to be heated.  This mode is typical for a water heater indirectly heated by a boiler.  The mode called IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint is similar but it bases its control decisions on an alternate setpoint given in the following field.  This mode is useful when the indirect source of heat may not satisfy the load and an internal heater is used for backup.  The mode called StorageTank is for a passive tank and it always requests flow unless the tank temperature is equal to or higher than the maximum limit given in the input field called Maximum Temperature Limit.

#### Field: Indirect Alternate Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name

This field is optional and is used to provide a schedule with alternate setpoints for use with the IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint mode in the previous field.  The input field should contain a reference to a schedule object specifying the hot water temperature setpoint [°C] to use as the "cut-out" temperature for control logic at the source side.

### WaterHeater:Sizing

The WaterHeater:Sizing object is used to provide additional input data needed for designing tank volume and/or heater capacity for either the Mixed or Stratified water heaters.  This object is only needed if volume or capacity is being automatically sized.  There are no output variable associated with this object --  sizing results are reported to the EIO output file and some predefined summary reports.

A source of design input data for use with this object can be found in the current ASHRAE Handbook HVAC Applications chapter on Service Water Heating.

The idd entry for this object follows.

#### Field: WaterHeater Name

This field contains the unique name of the water heater being sized.  This name should match the name of a Water Heater:Mixed or a Water Heater:Stratified input object defined elsewhere in the input file.

#### Field: Design Mode

This field describes which of several methods are to be used for sizing the water heater.  There are six possible choices and one of the following should be selected:

- **PeakDraw**. This design method uses the design flow rates of all the different demands placed on the water heater.  The tank size is based on how long it can meet the demand and how quickly it can recover.  The user enters the time in hours that the water heater can meet the demands.  Only the hot water uses connected to an individual water heater, or scheduled in the water heater object for stand-alone units, are included in that water heater’s peak draw.

- **ResidentialHUD-FHAMinimum** This design method is based on minimum permissible water heater sizes (established by HUD-FHA in its Minimum Property Standards for One- and Two-Family Living Units, No. 4900.1-1982).  The user enters the number of bathrooms and bedrooms in this input object.  The smallest allowable water heater sizes are used.

- **PerPerson** This design method scales sizes based on the total number of people in all zones in the building.  Each water heater in the model will be sized using the total (peak, design) number of people for the entire model.  The number of people is determined from People objects defined elsewhere in the input file

- **PerFloorArea** This design method scales sizes based on the total floor area in all the zones in the building.  Each water heater in the model will be sized using all the floor area in the model.  The floor areas are determined from the geometry input elsewhere in the input file.

- **PerUnit** This design method scales sizes based on an arbitrary number of units.  This can be used, for example, to size based on the number of rooms in a lodging building.  The user provides the number of units in an input field in this object.

- **PerSolarCollectorArea** This design method scales tank volume based on the collector area for a solar hot water collector.  The collector area is summed for all the collectors in the model and each tank is sized for the total.  The collector area is determined from input for Solar Collectors defined elsewhere in the input file.

#### Field: Time Storage Can Meet Peak Draw

This field provides the time, in hours, that the tank’s volume can sustain a peak draw.  It is used to size the tank’s volume which is the simple product of peak draw volume flow rate and the draw time.  There is no assurance that the water will be at the desired temperature for the entire draw.  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PeakDraw**.” For a water heater connected to a full plant loop, it should be on the supply side and the plant loop needs a Plant Sizing object and the draw rate is the Use side design flow rate. For a stand-alone water heater, the draw rate is the maximum scheduled peak use flow rate.

#### Field: Time for Tank Recovery

This field provides the the time, in hours, that tank’s heater needs to recover the volume of the tank. The temperatures used to define recovery are a starting temperature of 14.4ºC (58ºF) and a final temperature of 57.2ºC (135ºF). This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PeakDraw**.”

#### Field: Nominal Tank Volume for Autosizing Plant Connections

This field is used in case the water heater is indirectly heated by its source side connections and they are also autosized.  Because of the complexity of such a water heater and the timing for when sizing calculation happen inside EnergyPlus, the Source side connection flow rates need to be reported before the tank’s volume can be sized to meet Peak Draw.  This input field is used to provide a nominal tank volume to use temporarily while the flow connections are sized.  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PeakDraw**” and the water heater has autosized plant connections on the demand side.

#### Field: Number of Bedrooms

This field is used to enter the numer of bedrooms in the model.  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**ResidentialHUD-FHAMinimum**.”

#### Field: Number of Bathrooms

This field is used to enter the number of bathrooms in the model.  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**ResidentialHUD-FHAMinimum**.”

#### Field: Storage Capacity per Person

This field is used to enter the tank’s storage volume on per-person basis.  The units are m<sup>3</sup>/person.  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PerPerson**.”

#### Field: Recovery Capacity per Person

This field is used to enter the recovery capacity per person in units of m<sup>3</sup>/person/hr.  This is the volume of water the heater can recover in one hour per person.  Recovery is heating water from a starting temperature of 14.4ºC (58ºF) to a final temperature of 57.2ºC (135ºF).  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PerPerson**.”

#### Field: Storage Capacity per Floor Area

This field is used to enter the tank’s storage volume on a per-floor-area basis.  The units are m<sup>3</sup> /m<sup>2</sup> (water/floor area).  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PerFloorArea**.”

#### Field: Recovery Capacity per Floor Area

This field is used to enter the recovery capacity per floor area in units of m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/hr.  This is the volume water the heater can recover in an hour per floor area.  Recovery is heating water from a starting temperature of 14.4ºC (58ºF) to a final temperature of 57.2ºC (135ºF).  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PerFloorArea**.”

#### Field: Number of Units

This field is used to enter the number of Units for use in sizing on per-Unit basis with the next two fields.  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PerUnit**.”  This can be used to account for any arbitrary item such as lodging rooms, desks, water fixtures, restrooms, etc.

#### Field: Storage Capacity per Unit

This field is used to enter the tanks’ storage volume on per-Unit basis.  The units are m<sup>3</sup>/Unit.  The number of Units is entered in the previous field.  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PerUnit**.”

#### Field: Recovery Capacity per Unit

This field is used to enter the recover capacity per Unit in units of m<sup>3</sup>/Unit/hr.  This is the volume of water the heater can recover in an hour per Unit.  Recovery is heating water from a starting temperature of 14.4ºC (58ºF) to a final temperature of 57.2ºC (135ºF).  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PerUnit**.”

#### Field: Storage Capacity per Collector Area

This field is used to enter the tank’s storage volume on per-solar-collector-area basis.  The units are m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>.  This field is only used if the Design Mode is “**PerSolarCollectorArea**.”

#### Field: Height Aspect Ratio

This field is used to scale the height of a stratified tank to preserve relative geometry for different size tanks. The Height Aspect Ratio is defined at the length scale in the vertical direction (height) divided by the length scale in the horizontal direction (diameter).  This field is only used if the water heater being sized is a Water Heater:Stratified, the tank height has been set to Autosize, and the tank shape is set to **VerticalCylinder**. This field can be used with any Design Mode.

### WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser

The heat pump water heater with pumped condenser (HPWH) is a compound object consisting of a water heater tank (e.g., `WaterHeater:Mixed` or `WaterHeater:Stratified`), a direct expansion (DX) “coil” (i.e., an air-to-water DX compression system which includes a water heating coil, air coil, compressor, and water pump), and a fan to provide air flow across the air coil associated with the DX compression system. These objects work together to model a system which heats water using zone air, outdoor air, or a combination of zone and outdoor air as the primary heat source. Numerous configurations of tank location, inlet air source, and DX coil compressor location can be modeled, with one common configuration shown below.

![HPHotWaterHeater](media/image192.png)

Figure 81. Schematic diagram for a heat pump water heater located in a zone

In this model, the heat pump water heater’s DX coil is considered the primary heat source and the water tank’s heater (element or burner) provides supplemental heat as necessary. The model also assumes that the heat pump’s fan and water pump cycle on and off with the compressor.

To model a heat pump water heater, the input data file must include some combination of the following objects depending on the configuration to be modeled:

- `WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser` (required)

- `WaterHeater:Mixed` or `WaterHeater:Stratified` (required)

- `Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped` or `Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:VariableSpeed` (required)

- `Fan:OnOff` (required)

- `ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList` (when the HPWH draws some or all of its air from the zone, the heat pump water heater type and name must be in this list)

- `ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections` (when the HPWH draws some or all of its air from the zone, the HPWH air inlet and outlet node names must be provided in this object)

- `OutdoorAir:NodeList` (for HPWHs that use outdoor air as all or part of the heat source, the HPWH outdoor air node name must be provided in this list)

The input fields for the compound object are described in detail below:

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a heat pump water heater. Any reference to this heat pump water heater by another object will use this name.

#### Field: Availability Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump compressor is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump compressor is off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the heat pump compressor is available to operate during that time period. During times when the heat pump compressor is scheduled off, the heater (element or burner) in the water tank object operates based on its tank set point temperature schedule and the heat pump’s parasitic electric power is also off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Compressor Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that specifies the set point (or “cut-out”) temperature for the heat pump compressor. Temperature values used in this schedule should be in degrees Celsius. The heat pump compressor cycles off when the tank water reaches this set point temperature. Once the heat pump compressor cycles off, the tank water temperature floats downward until it falls below the set point temperature minus the dead band temperature difference defined below (i.e., the “cut-in” temperature). At this point, the heat pump compressor cycles on and remains on until the heat pump compressor set point temperature is reached.

#### Field: Dead Band Temperature Difference

This numeric field contains the dead band temperature difference in degrees Celsius. The heat pump compressor “cut-in” temperature is defined as the compressor set point temperature defined above minus this dead band temperature difference. The heat pump compressor cycles on when the water temperature in the tank falls below the “cut-in” temperature. The heat pump compressor remains on until the water temperature in the tank rises above the compressor set point (“cut-out”) temperature defined above. The dead band temperature difference must be greater than 0°C and less than or equal to 20°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5°C.

In this model, the heat pump water heater’s DX compression system is considered the primary heat source and the water tank’s heater (element or burner) provides supplemental heat as necessary. Therefore, the cut-in temperature for the heat pump compressor (set point minus dead band temperature difference) is usually higher than the set point temperature for the heater (element or burner) in the associated water heater tank object. At times when the water heater tank set point temperature is greater than the cut-in temperature of the heat pump compressor, the heat pump compressor is disabled and the tank’s heater is used to heat the water.

#### Field: Condenser Water Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the inlet water node for the heat pump’s water heating coil (condenser). This node name must also be specified in the water heater tank object as the source outlet node name, and in the DX coil object as the condenser water inlet node name.

#### Field: Condenser Water Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the outlet water node for the heat pump’s water heating coil (condenser). This node name must also be specified in the water heater tank object as the source inlet node name, and in the DX coil object as the condenser water outlet node name.

#### Field: Condenser Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the heat pump’s condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. It is the actual condenser water flow rate to be simulated, which may differ from the rated condenser water volumetric flow rate specified for the heat pump’s DX coil (Ref. Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump). This water flow rate must be greater than 0 or this field is autocalculatable. If autocalculated (field value = **autocalculate**), the condenser water flow rate is set equal to the rated heating capacity of the heat pump’s DX coil multiplied by 4.487E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s/W. When this flow rate is different from the Rated Condenser Water Volumetric Flow Rate specified in the heat pump’s DX coil object (Ref. Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump), the user should also specify a Total Heating Capacity Modifier Curve Name (function of water flow fraction) and a Heating COP Modifier Curve Name (function of water flow fraction) in the associated DX coil object to account for differences in capacity and power consumption at the off-rated water flow rate.

#### Field: Evaporator Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the air flow rate across the heat pump’s air coil (evaporator) in cubic meters per second. It is the actual air flow rate to be simulated, which may differ from the rated evaporator air volumetric flow rate specified for the heat pump’s DX coil (Ref. Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped). Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autocalculatable. If autocalculated (field value = **autocalculate**), the evaporator air flow rate is set equal to the rated heating capacity of the heat pump’s DX coil multiplied by 5.035E-5 m<sup>3</sup>/s/W. When this flow rate is different from the Rated Evaporator Air Volumetric Flow Rate specified in the heat pump’s DX coil object (Ref. Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped), the user should also specify a Total Heating Capacity Modifier Curve Name (function of air flow fraction) and a Heating COP Modifier Curve Name (function of air flow fraction) in the associated DX coil object to account for differences in capacity and power consumption at the off-rated air flow rate.

#### Field: Inlet Air Configuration

This choice field defines the configuration of the air flow path through the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan section. Valid entries are **Schedule**, **ZoneAirOnly**, **OutdoorAirOnly**, or **ZoneAndOutdoorAir**. If ‘Schedule’ is selected, names for an inlet air temperature schedule and an inlet air humidity schedule must be defined in the fields below. If ‘ZoneAirOnly’ is selected, the corresponding zone name must be entered in the Inlet Air Zone Name field below. If ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’ is selected, the corresponding Inlet Air Zone Name, Inlet Air Mixer Node Name, Outlet Air Splitter Node Name, and an Inlet Air Mixer Schedule Name must be entered in the corresponding fields below.

#### Field: Air Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the node from which the heat pump water heater draws its inlet air. If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’, then this node name should be the name of a zone air exhaust node (Ref. ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections). If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘OutdoorAirOnly’, this node name should be left blank. If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘Schedule’, this node name should simply be a unique name that allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node for verification purposes.

#### Field: Air Outlet Node Name

If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’, then this node name should be the name of a zone air inlet node (Ref. ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections). If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘OutdoorAirOnly’, this node name should be left blank. If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘Schedule’, this node name should simply be a unique name that allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node for verification purposes.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the node from which the heat pump water heater draws its outdoor air. If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘Schedule’, this node name should be left blank.

#### Field: Exhaust Air Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the node to which the heat pump water heater sends its exhaust air. If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘Schedule’, this node name should be left blank.

#### Field: Inlet Air Humidity Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule used to define the humidity of the inlet air to the heat pump evaporator and fan section. Schedule values must be entered as relative humidity fraction from 0 to 1 (e.g., a schedule value of 0.5 means 50%RH). This field is only used when the Inlet Air Configuration defined above is specified as ‘Schedule’, otherwise leave this field blank.

#### Field: Inlet Air Zone Name

#### Field: Tank Use Side Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the use side inlet node of the water heater tank used by this heat pump water heater. This name must match the Use Side Inlet Node Name in the water heater tank object (Ref. `WaterHeater:Mixed`). This field is required if the water heater tank use side nodes are connected to a plant loop, otherwise leave this field blank. When used, the branch object should reflect that this node is part of a `WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser` object (see branch object example below).

#### Field: Tank Use Side Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the use side outlet node of the water heater tank used by this heat pump water heater.

The minimum inlet air dry-bulb temperature should be greater than or equal to -5°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 10°C.

#### Field: Compressor Location

This alpha (choice) field contains the location of the heat pump compressor and the air temperature for this location is used to control operation of the compressor’s crankcase heater in the Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped object. Valid entries are **Schedule**, **Zone**, or **Outdoors**. If ‘Schedule’ is selected, a compressor ambient temperature schedule name must be defined in the field below; otherwise, the field below should be left blank. If ‘Zone’ is selected, the crankcase heater operation is controlled based on the air temperature in the zone defined in the field Inlet Air Zone Name, and the Inlet Air Configuration must be ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’. If ‘Outdoors’ is selected, crankcase heater operation is controlled based on the outdoor air temperature.

#### Field: Compressor Ambient Temperature Schedule Name

#### Field: On Cycle Parasitic Electric Load

This numeric field contains the on-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the heat pump water heater. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the heat pump compressor is operating and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. This parasitic load does, however, affect the zone air heat balance when the heat pump water heater sends some or all of its outlet air to a zone (i.e., Inlet Air Configuration field specified as ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’) and the Parasitic Heat Rejection Location field is specified as ‘Zone’. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Off Cycle Parasitic Electric Load

This numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the heat pump compressor. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the heat pump water heater is available but the compressor is not operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. This parasitic load does, however, affect the zone air heat balance when the heat pump water heater sends some or all of its outlet air to a zone (i.e., Inlet Air Configuration field specified as ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’) and the Parasitic Heat Rejection Location field is specified as ‘Zone’. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Parasitic Heat Rejection Location

This alpha (choice) field determines where the on-cycle and off-cycle parasitic heat is rejected. Valid choices are Zone and Exterior. If ‘Zone’ is selected, both the on-cycle and off-cycle parasitic heat is rejected to the zone defined in the field Inlet Air Zone Name, and the Inlet Air Configuration must be ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir. If ’Outdoors’ is selected, this parasitic heat is rejected outdoors (does not impact the zone air heat balance) regardless of the specified Inlet Air Configuration. If this field is left blank, the default value is ’Outdoors’.

#### Field: Inlet Air Mixer Node Name

This optional alpha field defines the name of the HVAC node which represents the mixture of outdoor air and zone air that enters the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan section. The model mixes outdoor air with zone air and places the result on this inlet air mixer node based on the Inlet Air Mixer Schedule defined below. When the schedule value is equal to 0, 100% zone air enters the evaporator coil and fan section of the heat pump water heater. When the schedule value is equal to 1, 100% outdoor air enters the evaporator coil and fan section. This node name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field above is specified as ‘ZoneAndOutdoor Air’, otherwise this field should be left blank.

#### Field: Outlet Air Splitter Node Name

This alpha field defines the name of the air node to which the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan sends all of its outlet air. The supply air flow downstream of this node is split between the zone and outdoors based on the Inlet Air Mixer schedule defined below. When the schedule value is equal to 0, the entire outlet air stream is diverted to the zone. When the schedule value is equal to 1, the entire outlet air stream is exhausted to outdoors. This node name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field above is specified as ‘Zone and Outdoor Air’, otherwise this field should be left blank.

#### Field: Inlet Air Mixer Schedule Name

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump draws its inlet air from the zone, outdoors, or a combination of zone and outdoor air. A schedule value equal to 0 indicates that the heat pump draws its inlet air from the zone. A schedule value equal to 1 denotes that the heat pump draws its inlet air from outdoors. Values between 0 and 1 denote a mixture of zone and outdoor air proportional to the schedule value. The Inlet Air Mixer schedule controls both the inlet air mixer and outlet air splitter nodes in unison to ensure that the operation of the heat pump does not contribute to zone pressurization or depressurization. For example if the Inlet Air Mixer schedule value is 0.4, then the inlet air mixer node is composed of 40% outdoor air and 60% zone air. For this same case, the outlet air splitter directs 60% of the HPWH outlet air back to the zone and 40% of the outlet air flow is exhausted outdoors. This schedule name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field is specified as ‘Zone and Outdoor Air’, otherwise this field should be left blank.

#### Field: Tank Element Control Logic

This alpha field defines settings for the control logic of when to run the tank element in relation to whether the heat pump is running. 

  - **MutuallyExclusive** means that once the tank heating element(s) are active, the heat pump is shut down until the heating element setpoint is reached. 
  - **Simultaneous** (default) means that both the tank heating element and heat pump are used at the same time to recover the tank temperature. 

#### Field: Control Sensor 1 Height In Stratified Tank

This alpha field defines where the tank temperature is sensed for heat pump control when the tank type is `WaterHeater:Stratified`.  The stratified tank model produces tank temperature at different nodes in the vertical direction and various options are available for how this temperature should be sensed to control the heat pump.  This is measured in height from the bottom of the tank. Internally the appropriate node is determined based on this height. If omitted, this defaults to the height of Heater1.

#### Field: Control Sensor 1 Weight

The model can optionally use two control sensor locations in stratified tanks. When that is the case, the temperature sensed at each location is weighted. This alpha input specifies the weight associated with Control Sensor 1. It is input as a value between 0 and 1. The weight of Control Sensor 2 is determined by subtracting this weight from 1. The default for this field is 1, indicating that only Control Sensor 1 is used. 

#### Field: Control Sensor 2 Height in Stratified Tank

This alpha field defines the optional second location where the tank temperature is sensed for heat pump control when the tank type is `WaterHeater:Stratified`. If omitted, this defaults to the height of Heater2.

Following is an example input for the `WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser` compound object and the other required component objects that it references.

### Pumped Condenser Heat Pump Water Heater Outputs

* **HVAC,Average,Water Heater Compressor Part Load Ratio**

* **HVAC,Average,Water Heater On Cycle Ancillary Electric Power [W]**

* **HVAC,Sum,Water Heater On Cycle Ancillary Electric Energy [J]**

* **HVAC,Average,Water Heater Off Cycle Ancillary Electric Power [W]**

* **HVAC,Sum,Water Heater Off Cycle Ancillary Electric Energy [J]**



#### Water Heater Compressor Part Load Ratio

This output is the average part-load ratio of the heat pump water heater’s compressor (as well as its water pump and fan) for the timestep being reported. This output is independent of the “Water Heater Part Load Ratio” (Ref. Water Heater Outputs) which represents the part-load ratio of the supplemental heater (element or burner) in the water tank. When the water tank’s (supplemental) heater set point temperature is higher than the cut-in temperature of the heat pump water heater’s compressor, the heat pump compressor is disabled and the water tank’s heater (element or burner) is used to heat the water. During these times the Water Heater Compressor Part Load Ratio is equal to 0.

#### Water Heater On Cycle Ancillary Electric Power [W]

#### Water Heater On Cycle Ancillary Electric Energy [J]

#### Water Heater Off Cycle Ancillary Electric Power [W]

#### Water Heater Off Cycle Ancillary Electric Energy [J]

These outputs are the parasitic electric power and consumption associated with the heat pump water heater. Specific outputs represent parasitic electrical usage during the compressor/fan on and off cycles. These outputs represent electronic controls or other electric component. The model assumes that the parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water, but it can impact the zone air heat balance depending on user inputs. The parasitic electric consumption outputs are also added to a meter with Resource Type = Electricity, End Use Key = DHW, Group Key = Plant (ref. Output:Meter objects).

### WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser

The heat pump water heater with wrapped condenser is a compound object very similar to the `WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser` object. It likewise combines a water heater tank, a direct expansion (DX) “coil”, and a fan to provide air flow across the air coil associated with the DX compression system. The primary difference is that instead of pumping water through an external condenser, the heating coils are wrapped around or submerged in the tank. This type of HPWH is most common in packaged units meant for residential applications.

To model a wrapped condenser heat pump water, the input data file must include some combination of the following objects depending on the configuration to be modeled:

- `WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser` (required)

- `WaterHeater:Stratified` (required)

- `Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped` (required)

- `Fan:OnOff` (required)

- `ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList` (when the HPWH draws some or all of its air from the zone, the heat pump water heater type and name must be in this list)

- `ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections` (when the HPWH draws some or all of its air from the zone, the HPWH air inlet and outlet node names must be provided in this object)

- `OutdoorAir:NodeList` (for HPWHs that use outdoor air as all or part of the heat source, the HPWH outdoor air node name must be provided in this list)

The input fields for the compound object are described in detail below:

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a heat pump water heater. Any reference to this heat pump water heater by another object will use this name.

#### Field: Availability Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump compressor is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump compressor is off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the heat pump compressor is available to operate during that time period. During times when the heat pump compressor is scheduled off, the heater (element or burner) in the water tank object operates based on its tank set point temperature schedule and the heat pump’s parasitic electric power is also off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

#### Field: Compressor Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that specifies the set point (or “cut-out”) temperature for the heat pump compressor. Temperature values used in this schedule should be in degrees Celsius. The heat pump compressor cycles off when the tank water reaches this set point temperature. Once the heat pump compressor cycles off, the tank water temperature floats downward until it falls below the set point temperature minus the dead band temperature difference defined below (i.e., the “cut-in” temperature). At this point, the heat pump compressor cycles on and remains on until the heat pump compressor set point temperature is reached.

#### Field: Dead Band Temperature Difference

This numeric field contains the dead band temperature difference in degrees Celsius. The heat pump compressor “cut-in” temperature is defined as the compressor set point temperature defined above minus this dead band temperature difference. The heat pump compressor cycles on when the water temperature in the tank falls below the “cut-in” temperature. The heat pump compressor remains on until the water temperature in the tank rises above the compressor set point (“cut-out”) temperature defined above. The dead band temperature difference must be greater than 0°C and less than or equal to 20°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5°C.

In this model, the heat pump water heater’s DX compression system is considered the primary heat source and the water tank’s heater (element or burner) provides supplemental heat as necessary. Therefore, the cut-in temperature for the heat pump compressor (set point minus dead band temperature difference) is usually higher than the set point temperature for the heater (element or burner) in the associated water heater tank object. At times when the water heater tank set point temperature is greater than the cut-in temperature of the heat pump compressor, the heat pump compressor is disabled and the tank’s heater is used to heat the water.

#### Field: Condenser Bottom Location

This numeric field contains the distance from the bottom of the tank to the bottom of the wrapped condenser. 

#### Field: Condenser Top Location

This numeric field contains the distance from the bottom of the tank to the top of the wrapped condenser.

#### Field: Evaporator Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the air flow rate across the heat pump’s air coil (evaporator) in cubic meters per second. It is the actual air flow rate to be simulated, which may differ from the rated evaporator air volumetric flow rate specified for the heat pump’s DX coil (Ref. Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped). Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autocalculatable. If autocalculated (field value = **autocalculate**), the evaporator air flow rate is set equal to the rated heating capacity of the heat pump’s DX coil multiplied by 5.035E-5 m<sup>3</sup>/s/W. When this flow rate is different from the Rated Evaporator Air Volumetric Flow Rate specified in the heat pump’s DX coil object (Ref. Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped), the user should also specify a Total Heating Capacity Modifier Curve Name (function of air flow fraction) and a Heating COP Modifier Curve Name (function of air flow fraction) in the associated DX coil object to account for differences in capacity and power consumption at the off-rated air flow rate.

#### Field: Inlet Air Configuration

This choice field defines the configuration of the air flow path through the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan section. Valid entries are **Schedule**, **ZoneAirOnly**, **OutdoorAirOnly**, or **ZoneAndOutdoorAir**. If ‘Schedule’ is selected, names for an inlet air temperature schedule and an inlet air humidity schedule must be defined in the fields below. If ‘ZoneAirOnly’ is selected, the corresponding zone name must be entered in the Inlet Air Zone Name field below. If ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’ is selected, the corresponding Inlet Air Zone Name, Inlet Air Mixer Node Name, Outlet Air Splitter Node Name, and an Inlet Air Mixer Schedule Name must be entered in the corresponding fields below.

#### Field: Air Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the node from which the heat pump water heater draws its inlet air. If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’, then this node name should be the name of a zone air exhaust node (Ref. ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections). If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘OutdoorAirOnly’, this node name should be left blank. If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘Schedule’, this node name should simply be a unique name that allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node for verification purposes.

#### Field: Air Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the node to which the heat pump water heater sends its outlet air. If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’, then this node name should be the name of a zone air inlet node (Ref. ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections). If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘OutdoorAirOnly’, this node name should be left blank. If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘Schedule’, this node name should simply be a unique name that allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node for verification purposes.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the node from which the heat pump water heater draws its outdoor air. If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘Schedule’, this node name should be left blank. If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’ or ‘OutdoorAirOnly’, this node name should be the name of an outdoor air node (Ref. OutdoorAir:NodeList).

#### Field: Exhaust Air Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the node to which the heat pump water heater sends its exhaust air. If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘Schedule’, this node name should be left blank. If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’ or ‘OutdoorAirOnly’, then this node name should be a unique name that allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node for verification purposes.

#### Field: Inlet Air Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule used to define the dry-bulb temperature of the inlet air to the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan section. Schedule values should be in degrees Celsius. This field is only used when the Inlet Air Configuration defined above is specified as ‘Schedule’, otherwise leave this field blank.

#### Field: Inlet Air Humidity Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule used to define the humidity of the inlet air to the heat pump evaporator and fan section. Schedule values must be entered as relative humidity fraction from 0 to 1 (e.g., a schedule value of 0.5 means 50%RH). This field is only used when the Inlet Air Configuration defined above is specified as ‘Schedule’, otherwise leave this field blank.

#### Field: Inlet Air Zone Name

This alpha field contains the name of the zone from which the heat pump evaporator and fan section draws some or all of its inlet air. This field is only used when the Inlet Air Configuration defined above is specified as ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’.

#### Field: Tank Object Type

This alpha (choice) field contains the type of water heater tank used by this heat pump water heater. Currently, the only valid choice is WaterHeater:Stratified.

#### Field: Tank Name

This alpha field contains the name of the specific water heater tank used by this heat pump water heater. This must be a tank of type `WaterHeater:Stratified`.

#### Field: Tank Use Side Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the use side inlet node of the water heater tank used by this heat pump water heater. This name must match the Use Side Inlet Node Name in the water heater tank object (Ref. `WaterHeater:Stratified`). This field is required if the water heater tank use side nodes are connected to a plant loop, otherwise leave this field blank. When used, the branch object should reflect that this node is part of a `WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser` object (see branch object example below).

#### Field: Tank Use Side Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the name of the use side outlet node of the water heater tank used by this heat pump water heater. This name must match the Use Side Outlet Node Name in the water heater tank object (Ref. `WaterHeater:Stratified`). This field is required if the water heater tank use side nodes are connected to a plant loop, otherwise leave this field blank. When used, the branch object should reflect that this node is part of a `WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser` object (see branch object example below).

#### Field: DX Coil Object Type

This alpha (choice) field contains the type of DX coil used by this heat pump water heater. Currently, the only valid choice is Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped.

#### Field: DX Coil Name

This alpha field contains the name of the specific DX coil (`Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped`) used by this heat pump water heater.

#### Field: Minimum Inlet Air Temperature for Compressor Operation

This numeric field contains the minimum inlet air dry-bulb temperature entering the air coil (evaporator) and fan section, in degrees Celsius, below which the heat pump compressor does not operate. The minimum inlet air dry-bulb temperature should be greater than or equal to -5°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 10°C.

#### Field: Compressor Location

This alpha (choice) field contains the location of the heat pump compressor and the air temperature for this location is used to control operation of the compressor’s crankcase heater in the Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped object. Valid entries are **Schedule**, **Zone**, or **Outdoors**. If ‘Schedule’ is selected, a compressor ambient temperature schedule name must be defined in the field below; otherwise, the field below should be left blank. If ‘Zone’ is selected, the crankcase heater operation is controlled based on the air temperature in the zone defined in the field Inlet Air Zone Name, and the Inlet Air Configuration must be ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’. If ‘Outdoors’ is selected, crankcase heater operation is controlled based on the outdoor air temperature.

#### Field: Compressor Ambient Temperature Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of a schedule that defines the ambient air temperature surrounding the heat pump compressor, which is used to control the compressor’s crankcase heater operation. This field is only used when the compressor location field defined above is specified as ‘Schedule’, otherwise it should be left blank.

#### Field: Fan Object Type

This alpha (choice) field contains the type of fan used by this heat pump water heater. Currently, the only valid choice is Fan: OnOff.

#### Field: Fan Name

This alpha field contains the name of the specific fan (`Fan:OnOff` object) used by this heat pump water heater.

#### Field: Fan Placement

This alpha (choice) field defines the placement of the fan in the heat pump water heater. Valid choices are **BlowThrough** (fan upstream of the air coil) and **DrawThrough** (fan downstream of the air coil). If this field is left blank, the default value is DrawThrough.

#### Field: On Cycle Parasitic Electric Load

This numeric field contains the on-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the heat pump water heater. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the heat pump compressor is operating and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. This parasitic load does, however, affect the zone air heat balance when the heat pump water heater sends some or all of its outlet air to a zone (i.e., Inlet Air Configuration field specified as ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’) and the Parasitic Heat Rejection Location field is specified as ‘Zone’. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Off Cycle Parasitic Electric Load

This numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the heat pump compressor. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the heat pump water heater is available but the compressor is not operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. This parasitic load does, however, affect the zone air heat balance when the heat pump water heater sends some or all of its outlet air to a zone (i.e., Inlet Air Configuration field specified as ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir’) and the Parasitic Heat Rejection Location field is specified as ‘Zone’. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Parasitic Heat Rejection Location

This alpha (choice) field determines where the on-cycle and off-cycle parasitic heat is rejected. Valid choices are Zone and Exterior. If ‘Zone’ is selected, both the on-cycle and off-cycle parasitic heat is rejected to the zone defined in the field Inlet Air Zone Name, and the Inlet Air Configuration must be ‘ZoneAirOnly’ or ‘ZoneAndOutdoorAir. If ’Outdoors’ is selected, this parasitic heat is rejected outdoors (does not impact the zone air heat balance) regardless of the specified Inlet Air Configuration. If this field is left blank, the default value is ’Outdoors’.

#### Field: Inlet Air Mixer Node Name

This optional alpha field defines the name of the HVAC node which represents the mixture of outdoor air and zone air that enters the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan section. The model mixes outdoor air with zone air and places the result on this inlet air mixer node based on the Inlet Air Mixer Schedule defined below. When the schedule value is equal to 0, 100% zone air enters the evaporator coil and fan section of the heat pump water heater. When the schedule value is equal to 1, 100% outdoor air enters the evaporator coil and fan section. This node name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field above is specified as ‘ZoneAndOutdoor Air’, otherwise this field should be left blank.

#### Field: Outlet Air Splitter Node Name

This alpha field defines the name of the air node to which the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan sends all of its outlet air. The supply air flow downstream of this node is split between the zone and outdoors based on the Inlet Air Mixer schedule defined below. When the schedule value is equal to 0, the entire outlet air stream is diverted to the zone. When the schedule value is equal to 1, the entire outlet air stream is exhausted to outdoors. This node name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field above is specified as ‘Zone and Outdoor Air’, otherwise this field should be left blank.

#### Field: Inlet Air Mixer Schedule Name

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump draws its inlet air from the zone, outdoors, or a combination of zone and outdoor air. A schedule value equal to 0 indicates that the heat pump draws its inlet air from the zone. A schedule value equal to 1 denotes that the heat pump draws its inlet air from outdoors. Values between 0 and 1 denote a mixture of zone and outdoor air proportional to the schedule value. The Inlet Air Mixer schedule controls both the inlet air mixer and outlet air splitter nodes in unison to ensure that the operation of the heat pump does not contribute to zone pressurization or depressurization. For example if the Inlet Air Mixer schedule value is 0.4, then the inlet air mixer node is composed of 40% outdoor air and 60% zone air. For this same case, the outlet air splitter directs 60% of the HPWH outlet air back to the zone and 40% of the outlet air flow is exhausted outdoors. This schedule name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field is specified as ‘Zone and Outdoor Air’, otherwise this field should be left blank.

#### Field: Tank Element Control Logic

This alpha field defines settings for the control logic of when to run the tank element in relation to whether the heat pump is running. 

  - **MutuallyExclusive** means that once the tank heating element(s) are active, the heat pump is shut down until the heating element setpoint is reached. 
  - **Simultaneous** (default) means that both the tank heating element and heat pump are used at the same time to recover the tank temperature. 

#### Field: Control Sensor 1 Height In Stratified Tank

This alpha field defines where the tank temperature is sensed for heat pump control when the tank type is `WaterHeater:Stratified`.  The stratified tank model produces tank temperature at different nodes in the vertical direction and various options are available for how this temperature should be sensed to control the heat pump.  This is measured in height from the bottom of the tank. Internally the appropriate node is determined based on this height. If omitted, this defaults to the height of Heater1.

#### Field: Control Sensor 1 Weight

The model can optionally use two control sensor locations in stratified tanks. When that is the case, the temperature sensed at each location is weighted. This alpha input specifies the weight associated with Control Sensor 1. It is input as a value between 0 and 1. The weight of Control Sensor 2 is determined by subtracting this weight from 1. The default for this field is 1, indicating that only Control Sensor 1 is used. 

#### Field: Control Sensor 2 Height in Stratified Tank

This alpha field defines the optional second location where the tank temperature is sensed for heat pump control when the tank type is `WaterHeater:Stratified`. If omitted, this defaults to the height of Heater2.

Following is an example input for the `WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser` compound object and the other required component objects that it references.

#### Water Heater Compressor Part Load Ratio

This output is the average part-load ratio of the heat pump water heater’s compressor (as well as its water pump and fan) for the timestep being reported. This output is independent of the “Water Heater Part Load Ratio” (Ref. Water Heater Outputs) which represents the part-load ratio of the supplemental heater (element or burner) in the water tank. When the water tank’s (supplemental) heater set point temperature is higher than the cut-in temperature of the heat pump water heater’s compressor, the heat pump compressor is disabled and the water tank’s heater (element or burner) is used to heat the water. During these times the Water Heater Compressor Part Load Ratio is equal to 0.

#### Water Heater On Cycle Ancillary Electric Power [W]

#### Water Heater On Cycle Ancillary Electric Energy [J]

#### Water Heater Off Cycle Ancillary Electric Power [W]

#### Water Heater Off Cycle Ancillary Electric Energy [J]

These outputs are the parasitic electric power and consumption associated with the heat pump water heater. Specific outputs represent parasitic electrical usage during the compressor/fan on and off cycles. These outputs represent electronic controls or other electric component. The model assumes that the parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water, but it can impact the zone air heat balance depending on user inputs. The parasitic electric consumption outputs are also added to a meter with Resource Type = Electricity, End Use Key = DHW, Group Key = Plant (ref. Output:Meter objects).


Group – Condenser Equipment
---------------------------

### Equipment Types

In each CondenserEquipmentList, various equipment types and names must be given. Each type-name pair must then have a corresponding equipment definition. This subsection lists the various equipment types that are available and examples from an IDF. Where appropriate, notes and comments on the input structure are provided.

### CoolingTower:SingleSpeed

Cooling towers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a single-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel’s theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the “free convection” regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for “free convection”, they must specify the corresponding airflow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field “Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference” for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of “free convection”, if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on “free convection” is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature based on “free convection” is below the set point, the tower will operate in FluidBypass mode – portion of the water goes through the tower media and gets cooled while the remaining water flow gets bypassed, two water flows then mix together trying to meet the water setpoint temperature. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after “free convection” is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan on for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the tower cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.

Cooling towers here are “wet” and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e. WaterUse:Storage objects).

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method – between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:

- Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

- Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity

- BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.

#### Field: Water Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower’s water inlet node.

#### Field: Water Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower’s water outlet node.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m<sup>3</sup>/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower (not the flow rate of water being sprayed on the outside of the heat exchange coil). If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically assumes a water flow rate of 5.382E-8 m3/s per watt (3 gpm/ton) of tower capacity specified in the field “Nominal Capacity”.

#### Field: Design Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design air flow rate induced by the tower fan in m<sup>3</sup>/s. A value greater than zero must be defined regardless of the tower performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. If autosized, the design air flow rate is calculated as follows:

<div>\[Design\;Air\;Flow\;Rate = \frac{{0.5{\rho_{air}}(Fan\;power\;at\;Design\;Air\;Flow\;Rate)}}{{190.}}\]</div>

where a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals and total fan efficiency of 0.5 are assumed.

***Field: Design Fan Power***

This numeric field contains the fan power (in watts) at the design air flow rate specified in the previous field. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of the tower performance input method, or this field can be autosized. If autosized, the fan power is calculated as follows:

If“Performance Input Method” is specified as “*UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate*”, then

<div>\[Fan\;power = 0.0105\cdot {\rho_{water}}\cdot {C_{p,water}}\cdot Design\;Water\;Flow\;Rate\cdot Design\;Loop\Delta T\]</div>

is used.

If“Performance Input Method” is specified as “*NominalCapacity*”, then

<div>\[Fan\;power = 0.0105\cdot Tower\;Nominal\;Capacity\]</div>

is used.

#### Field: Design U-Factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design tower UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), assuming a tower water inlet temperature of 35C and tower inlet air at 35C drybulb/25.6C wetbulb. If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field “Nominal Capacity”.

#### Field:Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the air flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/s) when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field “Design Air Flow Rate”. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “Design Air Flow Rate” determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model “free convection” and is using the Performance Input Method “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies the U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate or Free Convection Capacity as a value greater than zero, then the free convection air flow rate must be specified greater than 0.0.

#### Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime air flow rate.  The default is 0.1.

#### Field:Free Convection Regine U-Factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (W/K) when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field “U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate”. This field may be autosized, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate” determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model “free convection” and is using the  Performance Input Method “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field “Free Convection Capacity”.\\

#### Field: Free Convection U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime U-Factor times area value.  The default is 0.1.

#### Field: Performance Input Method

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: “**UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate**” or “**NominalCapacity**”. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be “**UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate**”. If the method “**UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate**” is selected, then the user must enter design UA values, design water flow rates and air flow rates as described for the previous input fields. If the method “NominalCapacity” is selected then the fields “Design Water Flow Rate”, “U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate” and “U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate” must be left blank, but the fields “Nominal Capacity” and “Free Convection Capacity” must be entered as described below.

#### Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio

This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.  This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.  The default is 1.25.

#### Field: Nominal Capacity

This numeric input field contains the “nominal” heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The value in the previous field times this nominal tower capacity gives the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions (based on historical assumption that the tower must dissipate additional heat from the compressor heat for heat removed at the evaporator).

#### Field: Free Convection Capacity

This numeric input field contains the “nominal” heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off), with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of nominal tower capacity (input field above). The heat rejection capacity and nominal capacity sizing ratio is applied tof this free convection tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions (typical value is 1.25 based on historical assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25W of compressor heat for every watt of heat removed by the evaporator). The value specified for this field must be less than the value specified for the field “Tower Nominal Capacity”. If the user does not wish to model “free convection”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies a value greater than zero, then the “Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime” field must contain a value greater than zero. This field can be automatically calculated using the sizing factor in the following field.

#### Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Free Convection Capacity. The default is 0.1.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower’s electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Mode

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: **LossFactor** or **SaturatedExit**. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Factor

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to **LossFactor**. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 [percent/K]. The default is 0.2.

#### Field: Drift Loss Percent

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Typical values for towers with efficient drift eliminators are between 0.002 and 0.2% of the condenser water flow rate. The default value is 0.008%.

#### Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options **ConcentrationRatio** or **ScheduledRate**. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

#### Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.

#### Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m<sup>3</sup>/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m<sup>3</sup>/s (17.3 to 112.3 m<sup>3</sup>/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

#### Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as ‘Starved’ water).

#### Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

#### Field:Capacity Control

This alpha field contains the cooling capacity control for the cooling tower. Two choices are available: **FanCycling** and **FluidBypass**. During part-load conditions, there are two ways to maintain the exiting water temperature at the setpoint: either cycling the tower fan, or bypassing portion of the tower water with a three-way valve. For FluidBypass, the tower fan still runs at full speed for the entire timestep, but only portion of the water flow goes through the cooling tower media to get cooled while the remaining portion of the water flow gets bypassed. Two water flows then mix at the common water sump to meet the setpoint temperature.

#### Field: Number of Cells

This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower

#### Field: Cell Control

This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:

**MinimalCell** : the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the *Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.*

**MaximalCell**: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the *Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction*.

#### Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction

This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.

#### Field: Cell Maximum  Water Flow Rate Fraction

This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.

***Field: Sizing Factor***

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.    Design Water Flow Rate;

2.    Design Air Flow Rate;

3.    Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

4.    U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate;

5.    Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime;

6.    U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate.

Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate is not *multiplied* by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design tower load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate is set to 10% of the new design Tower UA.

### CoolingTower:TwoSpeed

The two-speed cooling tower is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed tower. The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a two-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel’s theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the airflow rate and corresponding fan power at both high and low fan speed must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the “free convection” regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for “free convection”, they must specify the corresponding air flow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field “Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference” for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of “free convection”, if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on “free convection” is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after “free convection” is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature. If operating the tower fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the tower fan is increased to its high speed.

The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

Cooling towers here are “wet” and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a WaterUse:Storage object.

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method – between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:

- Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

- Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity

- BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)

***Field: Name***

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.

#### Field: Water Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower’s water inlet node.

#### Field: Water Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower’s water outlet node.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m<sup>3</sup>/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower (not the flow rate of water being sprayed on the outside of the heat exchange coil). If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically assumes a design water flow rate of 5.382E-8 m3/s per watt (3 gpm/ton) of tower capacity specified in the field “Tower High-Speed Nominal Capacity”.

#### Field: High Fan Speed Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the tower air flow rate at high fan speed in m<sup>3</sup>/s. A value greater than zero must be defined regardless of the tower performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. If autosized, the design air flow rate is calculated as follows:

<div>\[Air\,Flow\,Rate\,at\,High\,Fan\,Speed\, = \,\frac{{0.5{\rho_{air}}(Fan\,Power\,at\,High\,Fan\,Speed\,)}}{{190.}}\]</div>

where a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals and total fan efficiency of 0.5 are assumed.

***Field: High Fan Speed Fan Power***

This numeric field contains the fan power (in Watts) at the high-speed air flow rate specified in the previous field. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of the tower performance input method, or this field can be autosized. If autosized, the fan power is calculated as follows:

If“Performance Input Method” is specified as “*UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate*”, then

<div>\[Fan\;powe{r_{High\;Fan\;Speed}} = 0.0105\cdot {\rho_{water}}\cdot {C_{p,water}}\cdot Design\;Water\;Flow\;Rate\cdot Design\;Loop\Delta T\]</div>

is used.

If“Performance Input Method” is specified as “*NominalCapacity*”, then

<div>\[Fan\;powe{r_{High\;Fan\;Speed}} = 0.0105\cdot Tower\;High - Speed\;Nominal\;Capacity\]</div>

is used.

#### Field: High Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per degree Celsius corresponding to the high-speed air flow rate and design water flow rate specified above. If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the tower UA value at high fan speed is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), assuming a tower water inlet temperature of 35C and tower inlet air at 35C drybulb/25.6C wetbulb. If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the capacity specified in the field “High-Speed Nominal Capacity”.

#### Field: Low Fan Speed Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the tower air flow rate at low fan speed in m<sup>3</sup>/s. This value must be greater than zero, less than the value specified for the field “Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed”, and greater than the value specified for the field “Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime”. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed” determined in the next field.

#### Field: Low Fan Speed Air Flow Rate Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the low fan speed air flow rate.  The default is 0.5.

#### Field: Low Fan Speed Fan Power

This numeric field contains the fan power (in Watts) at the low-speed air flow rate specified in the previous field. This value must be specified greater than zero or the field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “Fan Power at High Fan Speed” determined in the next field.

#### Field: Low Fan Speed Fan Power Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the low speed fan power.  The default is 0.16.

#### Field: Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per degree Celsius corresponding to the design water flow rate and low-speed air flow rate specified above. If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, this value must be greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000, less than the value specified for the field “U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed”, and greater than the value specified for the field “U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate”. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed” determined in the following field. If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field “Low Speed Nominal Capacity”.

#### Field: Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the low speed heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA).  The default is 0.6.

#### Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the air flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/s) when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field “Air Flow Rate at Low Fan Speed”. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed” determined in the following field. If the user does not wish to model “free convection” and is using the Performance Input Method “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies the U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate or Free Convection Capacity as a value greater than zero, then the free convection air flow rate must be specified greater than 0.0.

#### Field: Free Convection Air Flow Rate Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime air flow rate.  The default is 0.1.

#### Field: Free ConvectionU-Factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (W/°C) when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field “U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed”. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed” determined in the following field. If the user does not wish to model “free convection” and is using the Performance Input Method “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field “Free Convection Capacity”.

#### Field: Free Convection U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime U-Factor times area value.  The default is 0.1.

#### Field: Performance Input Method

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate” or “NominalCapacity”. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”. If the method “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate” is selected, then the user must enter UA values, design water flow rate and air flow rates as described for the previous input fields. If the method “NominalCapacity” is selected then the fields “Design Water Flow Rate”, “U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed”, “U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed” and “U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate” must be left blank, but the fields “High Speed Nominal Capacity”, “Low Speed Nominal Capacity” and “Free Convection Capacity” must be entered as described below.

#### Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio

This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.  This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.  The default is 1.25.

#### Field: High Speed Nominal Capacity

This numeric input field contains the “nominal” heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts under high-speed fan operation, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of high-speed nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio set in the previous field is applied to this nominal tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating.

#### Field: Low Speed Nominal Capacity

This numeric input field contains the “nominal” heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts under low-speed fan operation, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of high-speed nominal tower capacity (input field above). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this nominal tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions. The value specified for this field must be greater than zero but less than the value specified for the field “High-Speed Nominal Capacity”.  This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the High Speed Nominal Capacity determined in the following field.

#### Field: Low Speed Nominal Capacity Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Low Speed Nominal Capacity. The default is 0.5.

#### Field: Free Convection Capacity

This numeric input field contains the “nominal” heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off), with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of high-speed nominal tower capacity (input field above). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this free convection tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.The value specified for this field must be less than the value specified for the field “Tower Low-Speed Nominal Capacity”. If the user does not wish to model “free convection”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies a value greater than zero, then the “Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime” field must contain a value greater than zero. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the High Speed Nominal Capacity determined in the following field.

#### Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Free Convection Capacity. The default is 0.1.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower’s electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Mode

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: ‘LossFactor’ or ‘SaturatedExit’. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Factor

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 [percent/K]. The default is 0.2.

#### Field: Drift Loss Percent

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Typical values for towers with efficient drift eliminators are between 0.002 and 0.2% of the condenser water flow rate. The default value is 0.008%.

#### Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options ConcentrationRatio or ScheduledRate. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio

#### Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.

#### Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m<sup>3</sup>/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m<sup>3</sup>/s (17.3 to 112.3 m<sup>3</sup>/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

#### Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as ‘Starved’ water).

#### Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

#### Field: Number of Cells

This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower

#### Field: Cell Control

This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:

**MinimalCell**: the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the *Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.*

**MaximalCell**: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the *Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction*.

#### Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction

This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.

#### Field: Cell Maximum  Water Flow Rate Fraction

This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.    Design Water Flow Rate;

2.    Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed;

3.    Fan Power at High Fan Speed;

4.    U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed;

5.    Air Flow Rate at Low Fan Speed;

6.    Fan Power at Low Fan Speed;

7.    U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed;

8.    Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime;

9.    U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate.

Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed is not *multiplied* by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design tower load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed is set to a fraction of the full load design UA determined by the field Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate is set to a fraction of the design Tower UA determined by the field Free Convection Air U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor.

### CoolingTower:VariableSpeed:Merkel

This variable speed tower model is based on Merkel's theory and is similar to the single-speed and two-speed tower models.  The open wet cooling tower is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with a variable-speed fan drawing air through the tower (induced-draft configuration). The model also includes a “free convection” regime where cooling tower performance modeled with the fan off.

For this model, Merkel’s theory is modified to include adjustments developed by Scheier to alter the heat transfer effectiveness based on current wetbulb, air flow rates, and water flow rates. The input requires performance curves or lookup tables to describe these three adjustment factors.

For a multi-cell tower, the capacity and air/water flow rate inputs are for the entire tower.

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.

#### Field: Water Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower’s water inlet node.

#### Field: Water Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower’s water outlet node.

#### Field: Performance Input Method

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: “**UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate**” or “**NominalCapacity**”. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be “**NominalCapacity**”. If the method “” is selected, then the user must enter design UA values, design water flow rates and air flow rates as described for the previous input fields. If the method “NominalCapacity” is selected then the fields “Design Water Flow Rate”, “U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate” and “U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate” must be left blank, but the fields “Nominal Capacity” and “Free Convection Capacity” must be entered as described below.

#### Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio

This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.  This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.  The default is 1.25.

#### Field: Nominal Capacity

This numeric input field contains the “nominal” heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts under full-speed fan operation, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio set in the previous field is applied to this nominal tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.  This field can be autosized, in which case a Sizing:Plant object is needed for the condenser loop.

#### Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity

This numeric input field contains the “nominal” heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off), with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this free convection tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.The value specified for this field must be less than the value specified for the field “Tower Low-Speed Nominal Capacity”. If the user does not wish to model “free convection”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies a value greater than zero, then the “Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime” field must contain a value greater than zero. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the High Speed Nominal Capacity determined in the following field.

#### Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Free Convection Capacity. The default is 0.1.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m<sup>3</sup>/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower. If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Sizing:Plant object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field can be autocalculated using the sizing factor in the following field.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate per Unit of Nominal Capacity

This numeric field contains a scalable sizing factor for design water flow rate that scales with nominal capacity, in units of m<sup>3</sup>/s/W. The default value is 5.382\*10<sup>-8</sup>. This field is only used if the previous field is set to autocalculate and performance input method is NominalCapacity.  (If the performance input method is set to UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate then the design water flow rate is obtained from the plant sizing result.)

#### Field: Design Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the tower air flow rate at full fan speed, in m<sup>3</sup>/s.  The value can be autocalculated, in which case the air flow rate is based off of the scalable sizing factor in the following input field.

#### Field: Design Air Flow Rate Per Unit of Nominal Capacity

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the design air flow rate from the nominal capacity, in units of m<sup>3</sup>/s/W.  The default is 2.76316\*10<sup>-5</sup>.  When this field is left blank, then the default value is used but the flow rate is also scaled to account for elevation (with larger volume flow rates at higher altitudes).  When a hard value is entered, even if it is the same as the default, then the design air flow rate is not also adjusted for elevation and the scaling factor is used directly.

#### Field: Minimum Air Flow Rate Ratio

This numeric field contains the minimum air flow rate ratio. The tower fan is allowed to operate between the ratio defined here and a maximum air flow rate ratio of 1.0 (which corresponds to the design [maximum] tower air flow rate). Below this value the tower is assumed to operate in the “free convection” regime with the tower fan off. The minimum air flow rate ratio must be greater than or equal to 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.5, with a default value of 0.2 if the field is left blank.

#### Field: Design Fan Power

This numeric field contains the fan power in watts at the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autocalculated. When the field is autocalculated the following input field is used to size the fan power based on nominal capacity.

#### Field: Design Fan Power Per Unit of Nominal Capacity

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the design fan power from the nominal capacity, in units of Watts per Watt. This field is only used if the previous is set to autocalculate. The default values is 0.0105.

#### Field: Fan Power Modifier Function of Air Flow Rate Ratio Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a curve or table object that describes fan power ratio (fan power/design fan power) as a function of air flow rate ratio (air flow rate/design air flow rate). The curve or table object must be for one independent variable, typically a cubic, and should be normalized to 1.0 at an air flow rate ratio of 1.0.  This field is required.

#### Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the air flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/s) when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field “Design Air Flow Rate”. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “Design Air Flow Rate” determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model “free convection” and is using the Performance Input Method “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies the U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate or Free Convection Capacity as a value greater than zero, then the free convection air flow rate must be specified greater than 0.0.

#### Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime air flow rate.  The default is 0.1.

#### Field: Design Air Flow Rate U-Factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design tower UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), assuming a tower water inlet temperature of 35C and tower inlet air at 35C drybulb/25.6C wetbulb. If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field “Nominal Capacity”.

#### Field: Free Convection Regime U-Factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (W/K) when the tower is in the “free convection” regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field “U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate”. This field may be autosized, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate” determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model “free convection” and is using the  Performance Input Method “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then this field should be set to 0.0. If “Performance Input Method” is specified as “NominalCapacity”, then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field “Free Convection Capacity”.

#### Field: Free Convection U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime U-Factor times area value.  The default is 0.1. This field is only used if the previous field is set to autocalculate and the performance input method is UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate.

#### Field: U-Factor Times Area Modifier Function of Air Flow Ratio Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a curve or table object that describes how the UA value varies as a function of air flow rate ratio (air flow rate/design air flow rate).  The result of this curve is multiplied by the design UA value to adjust for air flow rate, along with the two other modifiers discussed below.  The curve or table object must be for one independent variable and should be normalized to 1.0 at an air flow rate ratio of 1.0.  This field is required.

#### Field: U-Factor Times Area Modifier Function of Wetbulb Temperature Difference Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a curve or table object that describes how the UA value varies as a function of the current wetbulb temperature.  The result of this curve is multiplied by the design UA value to adjust for wetbulb temperatures that differ from design conditions at 25.56°C (78°F), along with the two other modifiers discussed in the previous and following fields.  The independe variable is the design wetbulb minus the current outdoor air wetbulb, in units of degrees Celsius.  The curve or table object must be for one independent variable and should be normalized to 1.0 at a wetbulb temperature difference of 0.0.  This field is required.

#### Field: U-Factor Times Area Modifier Function of Water Flow Ratio Curve Name

This alpha field contains the name of a curve or table object that describes how the UA value varies as a function of the current water flow rate ratio (water flow rate/design water flow rate). The result of this curve is multiplied by the design UA value to adjust for water flow rates that differ from design level, along with the other two modifiers discussed above. The curve or table object must be for one independent variable and should be normalized to 1.0 at a water flow ratio of 1.0.  This field is required

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower’s electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Mode

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: **LossFactor** or **SaturatedExit**. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Factor

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to **LossFactor**. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 [percent/K]. The default is 0.2.

#### Field: Drift Loss Percent

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Typical values for towers with efficient drift eliminators are between 0.002 and 0.2% of the condenser water flow rate. The default value is 0.008%.

#### Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options **ConcentrationRatio** or **ScheduledRate**. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

#### Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.

#### Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m<sup>3</sup>/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m<sup>3</sup>/s (17.3 to 112.3 m<sup>3</sup>/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

#### Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as ‘Starved’ water).

#### Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

#### Field: Number of Cells

This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower

#### Field: Cell Control

This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:

**MinimalCell** : the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the *Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.*

**MaximalCell**: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the *Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction*.

#### Field: Cell Minimum  Water Flow Rate Fraction

This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.

#### Field: Cell Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction

This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

### CoolingTower:VariableSpeed

The variable speed tower model is based on empirical curve fits of manufacturer’s performance data or field measurements. The user specifies tower performance at design conditions, and empirical curves are used to determine the approach temperature and fan power at off-design conditions. The user defines tower performance by entering the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, tower range, and tower approach temperature at the design conditions. The corresponding water flow rate (within ±25% of the tower’s rated water mass flow rate), air flow rate, and fan power must also be specified. The model will account for tower performance in the “free convection” regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). Basin heater operation and makeup water usage (due to evaporation, drift, and blowdown) are also modeled.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule is defined by the field “Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference” for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of “free convection” on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on “free convection” is at or below the set point, then the variable-speed tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature is above the set point after “free convection” is modeled, then the variable-speed tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature. Tower fan power is calculated based on the tower air flow rate required to achieve the exiting water set point temperature.

Cooling towers here are “wet” and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a WaterUse:Storage object.

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method – between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:

- Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

- Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity

- BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the variable speed cooling tower.

#### Field: Water Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower’s water inlet node.

#### Field: Water Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower’s water outlet node.

#### Field: Model Type

This alpha field contains the type of empirical model used to simulate the tower’s thermal performance (approach temperature). Valid choices for this field are “CoolToolsCrossFlow”, “CoolToolsUserDefined”, “YorkCalc”, or “YorkCalcUserDefined”. “CoolToolsCrossFlow” and “YorkCalc” are empirical models with the equation form and model coefficients already defined within EnergyPlus. If “CoolToolsUserDefined” or “YorkCalcUserDefined” is selected, the user must specify a valid Model Coefficient Name in the next input field to reference an appropriate CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools or CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc object. If a user-defined model type is selected and the specified Model Coefficient Name is not found in the input data file (idf), then a severe message is issued and the simulation will terminate.

#### Field: Model Coefficient Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the object(s) CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools or CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc. A single model coefficient object may be used to define coefficients for multiple variable speed cooling tower objects (i.e., the same name may be used in this input field for more than one variable speed tower). This field is only used when the field Tower Model Type described above is set to “CoolToolsUserDefined” or “YorkCalcUserDefined”, and should be left blank otherwise.

#### Field: Design Inlet Air Wet-Bulb Temperature

This numeric field specifies the inlet air wet-bulb temperature (˚C) at design conditions. This design temperature should correspond with the design values for range temperature, approach temperature, water flow rate, and air flow rate specified in the following fields. The minimum value for this field is 20˚C and the default value is 25.6˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Design Approach Temperature

This numeric field specifies the tower approach temperature (˚C) at design conditions. The approach temperature is the outlet water temperature minus the inlet air wet-bulb temperature. The design approach temperature should correspond with the design values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, water flow rate, and air flow rate specified for this tower. The value for this field must be greater than 0˚C and the default value is 3.9˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Design Range Temperature

This numeric field specifies the range temperature (˚C) at design conditions. The range temperature is defined as the inlet water temperature minus the outlet water temperature. The design range temperature should correspond with the design values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, approach temperature, water flow rate, and air flow rate specified for this tower. The value for this field must be greater than 0˚C and the default value is 5.6˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m<sup>3</sup>/s. The value entered should be within ±25% of the tower’s rated water mass flow rate as specified by the manufacturer if Model Type is “CoolToolsCrossFlow” or “YorkCalc”. This constraint may be different for Model Type “CoolToolsUserDefined” or “YorkCalcUserDefined” (ref. CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools or CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc).

This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. A Plant Sizing object must be defined if the field is autosized and the design water flow rate is then derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). The design water flow rate should correspond with the design values specified for the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, approach temperature, range temperature, and air flow rate. When this field is not autosized, the condenser loop flow rate specified in other objects should be within ±25% of the tower’s rated water flow rate (different range is permissible if Model Type is “User Defined”).

#### Field: Design Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower in m<sup>3</sup>/s. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. Autosizing of this field does not require a Plant Sizing object since the design air flow rate is assumed to be the design fan power multiplied by a total fan efficiency of 0.5 and divided by a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals. A correction for altitude is also included as follows:

<div>\[Design\;Air\;Flow\;Rate = \frac{{0.5(Fan\;power\;at\;Design\;Air\;Flow\;Rate)}}{{190.}}\left( {\frac{{101325.}}{{{P_{atm}}}}} \right)\]</div>

#### Field: Design Fan Power

This numeric field contains the fan power in watts at the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the fan power is calculated as follows:

<div>\[Design\,fan\;power = 0.0105\cdot {\rho_{water}}\cdot {C_{p,water}}\cdot Design\;Water\;Flow\;Rate\cdot Design\;Loop\Delta T\]</div>

#### Field: Fan Power Ratio Function of Air Flow Rate Ratio Curve Name

This alpha field contains the curve object name for fan power ratio (fan power/design fan power) as a function of air flow rate ratio (air flow rate/design air flow rate) [ref. Performance Curves]. The curve object must be a cubic curve and should be normalized to 1.0 at an air flow rate ratio of 1.0. If this field is left blank, a theoretical fan curve is assumed where fan power ratio is directly proportional to the air flow rate ratio cubed.

#### Field: Minimum Air Flow Rate Ratio

This numeric field contains the minimum air flow rate ratio. The tower fan is allowed to operate between the ratio defined here and a maximum air flow rate ratio of 1.0 (which corresponds to the design [maximum] tower air flow rate). Below this value, the tower is assumed to operate either in the “free convection” regime with the tower fan off, or the tower fan is cycled on/off to maintain the exiting water set point temperature. The minimum air flow rate ratio must be greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than or equal to 0.5, with a default value of 0.2 if the field is left blank.

#### Field: Fraction of Tower Capacity in Free Convection Regime

This numeric field contains the fraction of tower capacity available in the free convection regime (i.e., when the tower fan is off but water continues to flow through the tower). The tower fan does not operate when the free convection tower capacity is able to meet or exceed the exiting water set point temperature. The air flow rate through the tower in the free convection regime is assumed to be this same fraction of the tower design air flow rate. The fraction of tower capacity in free convection regime must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0.2, with a default value of 0.125 if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Capacity

This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower’s electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

#### Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Mode

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: ‘LossFactor’ or ‘SaturatedExit’. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Factor

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 [percent/K]. The default is 0.2.

#### Field: Drift Loss Percent

This numeric field contains the percent (%) of design water flow rate lost to the atmosphere at the design air flow rate due to drift, which is water droplets that are entrained in the airstream as it passes through the tower. Drift is assumed to vary directly with tower air flow rate ratio, and is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or blowdown. Typical values for water usage due to drift are from 0.05 to 0.2% of the total water circulation rate with currently-available drift eliminators from tower manufacturers. The value entered in this field must be greater than or equal to zero, and the default is zero if the field is left blank.

#### Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options ‘ConcentrationRatio’ or ‘ScheduledRate’. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

#### Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.

#### Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m<sup>3</sup>/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the condenser loop of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m<sup>3</sup>/s (17.3 to 112.3 m<sup>3</sup>/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

#### Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUser:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as ‘Starved’ water).

#### Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

#### Field: Number of Cells

This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower

#### Field: Cell Control

This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:

**MinimalCell**: the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the *Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.*

**MaximalCel** : As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the *Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction*.

#### Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction

This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.

#### Field: Cell Maximum  Water Flow Rate Fraction

This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.    Design Water Flow Rate;

2.    Design Air Flow Rate;

3.    Design Fan Power.

#### Cooling Tower Fan Part Load Ratio []

This is the on/off cycling rate of the tower fan when free convection cannot meet the set point temperature and the tower capacity at the minimum air flow rate ratio drives the tower exiting water temperature below the set point temperature. The fan part-load ratio is calculated as the ratio of the exiting water temperature in the free convection regime minus the exiting water temperature set point divided by the exiting water temperature in the free convection regime minus the exiting water temperature at the minimum air flow rate ratio. If tower air flow is at or above the minimum air flow rate ratio, then the tower fan part-load ratio is 1.0.

During times when the tower can maintain the condenser loop set point temperature using free convection (when the fan in not operating), the air flow rate ratio is assumed to be equal to the field Fraction of Tower Capacity in Free Convection Regime. During times when the fan cycles on/off to maintain the outlet water set point temperature, the air flow rate ratio is calculated as the summation of Fan Part-Load Ratio multiplied by the Minimum Air Flow Rate Ratio and (1.0 - Fan Part-Load Ratio) multiplied by the fraction of Tower Capacity in Free Convection Regime.

### CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools

Variable speed cooling towers can be modeled by EnergyPlus with user-selectable performance based on the CoolTools correlation, YorkCalc correlation, or user-defined coefficients for either the CoolTools or YorkCalc correlations.The empirical CoolTools tower correlation uses a set of 35 coefficients to model the thermal performance (approach temperature) of a cooling tower based on four independent variables. If the user specifies Model Type = CoolToolsCrossFlow in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object, then the 35 coefficients derived for the CoolTools simulation model are used and these coefficients are already defined within EnergyPlus. If the user specifies Model Type = CoolToolsUserDefined, then the user must enter a CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools object to define the 35 coefficients that will be used by the CoolTools correlation.

The user must specify a name for the model coefficient object, and this name must be used in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object (field Model Coefficient Name) to tell the program to use these coefficients. Next, the user enters the minimum and maximum values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, approach temperature, and water mass flow rate ratio to specify the valid range for which the model coefficients were derived. For all of these variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range specified. For approach and range, the warnings are issued if the values are beyond the specified minimum/maximum range but the actual values are still used.

The CoolTools correlation has four independent variables: inlet air wet-bulb temperature (Twb), tower range temperature (Tr), water flow rate ratio (FRwater), and air flow rate ratio (FRair). Temperatures are in units of ˚C and flow rate ratios are dimensionless (actual flow rate divided by design flow rate). Using these independent variables, tower approach temperature (˚C) is calculated as follows:

Approach =   Coeff(1)  +  Coeff(2)•FRair  +  Coeff(3)•(FRair)<sup>2</sup>  +

Coeff(4)•(FRair)<sup>3</sup>  +  Coeff(5)•FRwater  +

Coeff(8)•(FRwater)<sup>2</sup>  +  Coeff(9)•FRair•(FRwater)<sup>2</sup>  +

Coeff(10)•(FRwater)<sup>3</sup>  +  Coeff(11)•Twb  +  Coeff(12)•FRair•Twb  +

Coeff(33)•FRwater•(Tr)<sup>2 </sup> +  Coeff(34)•Twb•(Tr)<sup>2 </sup> +  Coeff(35)•(Tr)<sup>3</sup>

This object allows the user to specify model coefficients for use with the CoolTools correlation shown above. It is recommended that a broad set of cooling tower performance data be used to generate these model coefficients. The data set used to create the model coefficients should cover the entire range of water and air flow rate ratios and inlet air wet-bulb, range, and approach temperatures expected during the simulation.

No additional cooling tower output variables are output when this object is used.

### CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc

Variable speed cooling towers can be modeled by EnergyPlus with user-selectable performance based on the CoolTools correlation, YorkCalc correlation, or user-defined coefficients for either the CoolTools or YorkCalc correlations.The empirical YorkCalc tower correlation uses a set of 27 coefficients to model the thermal performance (approach temperature) of a variable speed cooling tower based on three independent variables. If the user specifies Tower Model Type = YorkCalc in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object, then the 27 coefficients derived for the YorkCalc simulation model are used and these coefficients are already defined within EnergyPlus. If the user specifies Tower Model Type = YorkCalcUserDefined, then the user must enter a CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc object to define the 27 coefficients that will be used by the YorkCalc correlation.

The user must specify a name for the model coefficient object, and this name must be used in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object (field Model Coefficient Name) to tell the program to use these coefficients. Next, the user enters the minimum and maximum values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, approach temperature, and water mass flow rate ratio to specify the valid range for which the model coefficients were derived. The user also specifies the maximum valid liquid-to-gas ratio. For all of these variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range specified. For approach, range, and liquid-to-gas ratio the warnings are issued if the values are beyond the specified minimum/maximum range but the actual values are still used.

The YorkCalc correlation has three independent variables: inlet air wet-bulb temperature (Twb), tower range temperature (Tr), and the liquid-to-gas ratio (ratio of water flow rate ratio to air flow rate ratio = LGRatio). Temperatures are in units of ˚C and liquid-to-gas ratio is dimensionless. Using these independent variables, an approach temperature (˚C) is calculated as follows:

    Approach =      Coeff(1)  +  Coeff(2)•Twb  +  Coeff(3)•Twb<sup>2 </sup> +  Coeff(4)•Tr  +

Coeff(5)•Twb•Tr  +  Coeff(6)•Twb<sup>2</sup>•Tr  +  Coeff(7)•Tr<sup>2</sup>  +

Coeff(8)•Twb•Tr<sup>2 </sup> +  Coeff(9)•Twb<sup>2</sup>•Tr<sup>2</sup> + Coeff(10)•LGRatio  +

Coeff(11)•Twb•LGRatio  +  Coeff(12)•Twb<sup>2</sup>•LGRatio  +

Coeff(13)•Tr•LGRatio  +  Coeff(14)•Twb•Tr•LGRatio  +

### EvaporativeFluidCooler:SingleSpeed

Evaporative fluid coolers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The Evaporative fluid cooler is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with single-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of three methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or standard fluid cooler design capacity at a specific rating point or design capacity at non standard conditions. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.

The evaporative fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the evaporative fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field “Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference” for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan on for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the fluid cooler cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.

Evaporative fluid coolers consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the fluid coolers. For this purpose, the last seven input fields can either be provided in the input or if nothing is specified then the default values for these fields will be used. These fields provide the methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the building’s water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e. WaterUse:Storage objects). The schematic of the system is shown below:

#### Field: Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the fluid cooler.

#### Field: Water Inlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the fluid cooler’s water inlet node.

#### Field: Water Outlet Node Name

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the fluid cooler’s water outlet node.

#### Field: Design Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design air flow rate induced by the fluid cooler fan in m<sup>3</sup>/s. The field must contain a value greater than zero regardless of the fluid cooler performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. See Engineering Reference document for autosizing calculations.

#### Field: Design Air Flow Rate Fan Power

This numeric field contains the fan power (in watts) at the design air flow rate specified in the previous field. The field must contain a value greater than zero regardless of the fluid cooler performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. See Engineering Reference document for autosizing calculations.

#### Field: Design Spray Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design spray water flow rate through the fluid cooler in m<sup>3</sup>/s. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of the performance input method,

#### Field: Performance Input Method

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify fluid cooler performance: “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate” or “StandardDesignCapacity” or “UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity”.

#### Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the fluid cooler. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the fluid cooler are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

#### Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio

This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.  This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.  The default is 1.25.

#### Field: Standard Design Capacity

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). 125% of this capacity gives the actual fluid cooler heat rejection at these operating conditions (based on historical assumption that the evaporative fluid cooler must dissipate 0.25W of compressor heat for every watt of heat removed by the evaporator). This field is only used for performance input method =”StandardDesignCapacity”. For other input methods this field is ignored. The standard conditions mentioned above for “standard design capacity” are already specified in the EnergyPlus. So the input fields such as design entering water temp., design entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temp. and design water flow rate, if provided in the input, will be ignored for the StandardDesignCapacity performance input method. Also, the standard conditions are for water as a fluid type so this performance input method can only be used with water as a fluid type (ref. CondenserLoop object).

#### Field: Design Air Flow Rate U-factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design fluid cooler UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), the fluid cooler inlet air dry-bulb and wetbulb temperature are taken from the input. This field is only used for performance input method =” UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”. For other performance input methods, this field is ignored.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the fluid cooler in m<sup>3</sup>/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the fluid cooler. This field is ignored for the “StandardDesignCapacity” performance input method. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections).

#### Field: User Specified Design Capacity

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts. Design conditions for this capacity i.e. entering air dry-bulb temperature, entering air wet-bulb temperature and entering water temperature must be provided in the input. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field:Design Entering Water Temperature

This numeric field contains entering water temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering water temperature must be greater than the design entering air temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field:Design Entering Air Temperature

This numeric field contains entering air dry-bulb temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering air temperature must be greater than the design entering air wet-bulb temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field:Design Entering Air Wet-bulb Temperature

This numeric field contains entering air wetbulb temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering air wet-bulb temperature must be less than the design entering air (dry-bulb) temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field: Capacity Control

This alpha field contains the cooling capacity control for the evaporative fluid cooler. Two choices are available: FanCycling and FluidBypass. During part-load conditions, there are two ways to maintain the exiting water temperature at the setpoint: either cycling the evaporative fluid cooler fan, or bypassing portion of the evaporative fluid cooler water with a three-way valve. For FluidBypass, the evaporative fluid cooler fan still runs at full speed for the entire timestep, but only portion of the water flow goes through the evaporative fluid cooler media to get cooled while the remaining portion of the water flow gets bypassed. Two water flows then mix at the common water sump to meet the setpoint temperature.

#### Field: Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.   Design Water Flow Rate;

2.   Design Air Flow Rate;

3.   Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

4.   U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate;

Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate is not multiplied by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design evaporative fluid cooler load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual.

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Mode

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the evaporative fluid cooler. There are two options: LossFactor or SaturatedExit. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the evaporative fluid cooler is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the evaporative fluid cooler model (and does not require additional user input).

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Factor

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the evaporative fluid cooler and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Empirical correlation is used to calculate default loss factor if it not explicitly specified in the input file.

#### Field: Drift Loss Percent

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower’s evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

#### Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options ConcentrationRatio or ScheduledRate. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

#### Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the evaporative fluid cooler as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the evaporative fluid cooler in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower’s evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

#### Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m3/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the evaporative fluid cooler of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower’s evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the evaporative fluid cooler is active and water is flowing through the evaporative fluid cooler (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

#### Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the evaporative fluid cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the evaporative fluid cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the evaporative fluid cooler needs, then the evaporative fluid cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as ‘Starved’ water).

### EvaporativeFluidCooler:TwoSpeed

The two-speed evaporative fluid cooler is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed evaporative fluid cooler. The evaporative fluid cooler is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with two-speed fan (induced draft configuration. See schematic diagram in EvaporativeFluidCooler:SingleSpeed section). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of the three methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or standard fluid cooler design capacity at a specific rating point or design capacity at non standard conditions. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.

The evaporative fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the evaporative fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field “Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference” for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If operating the fluid cooler fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the fluid cooler fan is increased to its high speed.

The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

Evaporative fluid coolers consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the evaporative fluid coolers. For this purpose, the last seven input fields can either be provided in the input or if nothing is specified then the default values for these fields will be used. These fields provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e. WaterUse:Storage objects).

#### Field: High Fan Speed Fan Power

This numeric field contains the fan power (in Watts) at the high-speed air flow rate specified in the previous field. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of fluid cooler performance input method, or this field can be autosized. See Engineering Reference document for fluid cooler autosizing.

#### Field: Low Fan Speed Air Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the fluid cooler air flow rate at low fan speed in m<sup>3</sup>/s. This value must be greater than zero, less than the value specified for the field “Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed”.

This numeric field contains the sizing factor for calculating the low fan speed fan power as a fraction of the high fan speed fan power.  The default is 0.16.

#### Field: Design Spray Water Flow Rate

#### Field: Performance Input Method

#### Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the fluid cooler. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the fluid cooler are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

#### Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio

Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.  The default is 1.25.

#### Field: High Speed Standard Design Capacity

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio set in the previous field is applied to this capacity to give the actual fluid cooler heat rejection at these operating conditions. This field is only used for performance input method =”StandardDesignCapacity”. For other input methods this field is ignored. The standard conditions mentioned above for “standard design capacity” are already specified in the EnergyPlus. So the input fields such as design entering water temp., design entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temp. and design water flow rate, if provided in the input, will be ignored for the StandardDesignCapacity performance input method. Also, the standard conditions are for water as a fluid type so this performance input method can only be used with water as a fluid type (ref. CondenserLoop object).

#### Field: Low Speed Standard Design Capacity

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this capacity to give the actual fluid cooler heat rejection at these operating conditions. This field is only used for performance input method =”StandardDesignCapacity”. For other input methods this field is ignored. The standard conditions mentioned above for “standard design capacity” are already specified in the EnergyPlus. So the input fields such as design entering water temp., design entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temp. and design water flow rate, if provided in the input, will be ignored for the StandardDesignCapacity performance input method. Also, the standard conditions are for water as a fluid type so this performance input method can only be used with water as a fluid type (ref. CondenserLoop object). The value specified for this field must be greater than zero but less than the value specified for the field “High-Speed Standard Design Capacity”. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the High-Speed Standard Design Capacity determined in the following field.

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the high speed design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field “Performance Input Method” is specified as “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 2,100,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design fluid cooler UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), the fluid cooler inlet air dry-bulb and wetbulb temperature are taken from the input. This field is only used for performance input method =” UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”. For other input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field: Low Fan Speed U-factor Times Area Value

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per degree Kelvin corresponding to the low speed design air and water flow rates specified above.

This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a factor of the “U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed” determined in the following field. This field is only used for performance input method =” UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”. For other input methods this field is ignored.

This field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Value.  The default is 0.6.

#### Field: Design Water Flow Rate

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the fluid cooler in m<sup>3</sup>/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the fluid cooler. This field is ignored for the “StandardDesignCapacity” performance input method. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections).

#### Field: High Speed User Specified Design Capacity

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts. Design conditions for this capacity i.e. entering air dry-bulb temperature, entering air wet-bulb temperature and entering water temperature must be provided in the input. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field: Low Speed User Specified Design Capacity

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts. Design conditions for this capacity i.e. entering air dry-bulb temperature, entering air wet-bulb temperature and entering water temperature must be provided in the input. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the “High Speed User Specified Design Capacity” determined in the following field.

#### Field: Low Speed User Specified Design Capacity Sizing Factor

This field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Low-Speed User Specified Design Capacity.  The default is 0.5.

#### Field:Design Entering Water Temperature

This numeric field contains entering water temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering water temperature must be greater than the design entering air temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field:Design Entering Air Temperature

This numeric field contains entering air dry-bulb temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering air temperature must be greater than the design entering air wet-bulb temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field:Design Entering Air Wet-bulb Temperature

This numeric field contains entering air wetbulb temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering air wet-bulb temperature must be less than the design entering air (dry-bulb) temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

#### Field: High Speed Sizing Factor

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.    Design Water Flow Rate;

2.    Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed;

3.    Fan Power at High Fan Speed;

4.    U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed;

5.    Air Flow Rate at Low Fan Speed;

6.    Fan Power at Low Fan Speed;

7.    U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed;

Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed is not multiplied by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design evaporative fluid cooler load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed is set to Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor times the full load design UA.

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Mode

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the evaporative fluid cooler. There are two options: LossFactor or SaturatedExit. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the evaporative fluid cooler is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the evaporative fluid cooler model (and does not require additional user input).

#### Field: Evaporation Loss Factor

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the evaporative fluid cooler and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Empirical correlation is used to calculate default loss factor if it not explicitly specified in the input file.

#### Field: Drift Loss Percent

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower’s evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

#### Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options ConcentrationRatio or ScheduledRate. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

#### Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the evaporative fluid cooler as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the evaporative fluid cooler in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower’s evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

#### Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m3/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the evaporative fluid cooler of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower’s evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the evaporative fluid cooler is active and water is flowing through the evaporative fluid cooler (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

#### Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the evaporative fluid cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the evaporative fluid cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the evaporative fluid cooler needs, then the evaporative fluid cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as ‘Starved’ water).

### FluidCooler:SingleSpeed

Fluid coolers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The Fluid cooler is modeled as a cross flow heat exchanger (both streams unmixed) with single-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of the two methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal fluid cooler capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.

The fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field “Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference” for the CondenserLoop object. The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan on for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep).

### FluidCooler:TwoSpeed

The two-speed fluid cooler is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed fluid cooler. The fluid cooler is modeled as a cross flow heat exchanger (both stream unmixed) with  two-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of two methods: heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal fluid cooler capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the airflow rate and corresponding fan power at both high and low fan speed must be specified. The Fluid Cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the Fluid Cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule is defined by the field “Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference” for the CondenserLoop object. The model first runs at low speed and calculates the fluid cooler exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on “low speed” is at or below the set point, then the fluid cooler fan runs at this speed or below this speed. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after “low speed” is modeled, then the fluid cooler fan runs at high speed to reduce the exiting water temperature.

The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep,).
