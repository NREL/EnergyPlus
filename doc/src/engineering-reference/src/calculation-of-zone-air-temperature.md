# Calculation of Zone Air Temperature

The zone air heat balance is the primary mechanism for linking the loads calculation to the system simulation.  As such, the zone air temperature becomes the main interface variable.  Its role in the integration process was described previously ("Basis for the Zone and Air System Integration").
