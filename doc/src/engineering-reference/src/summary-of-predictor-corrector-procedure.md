# Summary of Predictor-Corrector Procedure

The predictor-corrector scheme can be summarized as follows:

- Using equation , an estimate is made of the air system energy required to balance the equation with the zone air temperature equal to the setpoint temperature.
- With that quantity as a demand, the air system is simulated to determine its actual supply capability at the time of the simulation. This will include a plant simulation if necessary.
- The actual air system capability is used in equation  to calculate the resulting zone temperature.
