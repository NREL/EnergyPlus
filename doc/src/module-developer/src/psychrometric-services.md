# Psychrometric services

EnergyPlus has a full complement of psychrometric functions. All the routines are Fortran functions returning a single precision real value.  All arguments and results are in SI units.

> Note that each of the psychrometric routines has a "calledfrom" optional parameter â€“ this has been implemented in some of the calling routines and is useful when errors are detected during simulation for support personnel to figure out where the psych routine is called from.

The Names for the different Psychrometric Routines are based on the following self-explanatory format; the different variables used in the Psych Routine taxonomy are as follows.

H = Enthalpy

W= Humidity Ratio

Rh= Relative Humidity

V= Specific Volume

Rhov= Vapor Density of Air

Hfg = Latent energy (heat of vaporization for moist air)

Hg= Enthalpy of gaseous moisture

Pb= Barometric Pressure

Twb=Temperature Wet Bulb

Twd= Temperature Dry Bulb

Tdp= Temperature Dew Point

Tsat and Psat= Saturation Temperature and Saturation Pressure

Psy## Fn ##     = Psy {## is a Function of  ##}

Note: Each of the two capital alphabets together have different meaning

       Eg:     **{Psy ## Fn HW}= {Psy ## Function of  Enthalpy and Humidity Ratio}**
