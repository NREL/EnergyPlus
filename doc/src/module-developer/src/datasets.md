# DataSets

Akin to the libraries of other programs, EnergyPlus uses data sets.  Data sets are similar to libraries but many items are contained in a single file (usually input file format or sometimes macro format).  Developers are encouraged, as appropriate, to submit data sets along with new features.  Some of the existing data sets include:

- Materials properties
- Construction elements (layers of materials)
- Composite construction definitions (equivalent constructions for complex elements)
- Solar Collector parameters
- Economic Tariffs
- Design Day definitions
- Location definitions
- Standard report definitions
