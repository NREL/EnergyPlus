# Build System 

The EnergyPlus internal development team uses two types of build systems.  Most developers who are not involved in release packages and external libraries use a simple project setup for their particular integrated development environment and Fortran compiler.  However, the main build system for external libriares is based on CMAKE (Cross Platform Make) http://www.cmake.org/.

Access to the separate repository where the CMAKE files and stored library code will be made available to those developers involved witth external library development. Currently (as of version 7.2) this repository uses SVN and internal development members will need to request access through their supervisors/EnergyPlus project POCs (Points of Contact).
