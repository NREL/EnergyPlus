# Reference Documents

This document is one of a set of documents for the EnergyPlus developer.  It describes the programming standards for EnergyPlus source code and shall be followed by all developers (whether funded directly from the EnergyPlus funding or collaborative developers who submit modules to the team for inclusion). Other documents in the set are:

**Guide for Interface Developers:** Everything you need to know about EnergyPlus Input and Output (to develop a user-friendly interface)

The Interface Developer's Guide will tell you all the information about using and developing IDD (Input Data Dictionary) statements, Input Data File (IDF) statements, EnergyPlus outputs, and essentials of running EnergyPlus.

**Guide for Module Developers:** Everything you need to know about developing for EnergyPlus

The Module Developer's Guide will tell you further about useful routines and functions built into the EnergyPlus code that will make getting items from the IDF for your simulation relatively easy.  Other parts of the guide tell about utility routines and functions as well as how to create the documents and how to document your example input files.

**Engineering Reference:** The Reference to EnergyPlus Calculations (in case you want or need to know)

The Engineering documentation gives details of the theory, equations and, occasionally, code snippets behind the EnergyPlus features.

**Input-Output Reference:** The Encyclopedic Reference to EnergyPlus Input and Output

Extensive details of the inputs used and outputs (reported variables) produced with EnergyPlus.

**Output Details and Examples:** An In-Depth Guide to EnergyPlus Output and Example Files

Extensive details output files and (future) examples files distributed with EnergyPlus.

**Auxiliary Programs:** To Increase Your Efficiency at Using EnergyPlus

*Guides for the Weather Converter program, Using Ground Heat Transfer in EnergyPlus, HVAC Templates, WinEPDraw, EP-Macro, VCompare, and Transition (Convert old IDFs to later release version IDFs).  (and more)*

**Getting Started:** Everything You Need to Know about Running EnergyPlus (and a start at building simulation)

A guide to running EnergyPlus and some of the auxiliary programs as well as an introduction to building simulation modeling for those who might be new to the field or new to the precepts of EnergyPlus.
