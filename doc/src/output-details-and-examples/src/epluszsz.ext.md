This file is a result of the zone sizing calculation. Zone Sizing (see Sizing:Zone object) performs a special calculation, using a theoretical ideal zonal system, and determines the zone design heating and cooling flow rates and loads, saving the results in the zone sizing arrays. The file has a similar format to the eplusssz.<ext> file.

The columns are:

### Field: Time

Calculation time â€“ this will show the time steps used by the simulation and by the sizing calculation.

### Sizing Calculation Fields

Each of the Zone Sizing output fields has the Zone Name, the Environment Name for the peak prepended to the item that has been calculated.  The four fields calculated are:

- Des Heat Load
- Des Sens Cool Load
- Des Heat Mass Flow
- Des Cool Mass Flow

These are repeated for the number of zones in the sizing calculation.

### Field:  Des Heat Load [W]

This is the calculated design/required heating load at the time step.

### Field:  Des Sens Cool Load [W]

This is the calculated design/required cooling load at the time step.

### Field:  Des Heat Mass Flow [kg/s]

This is the calculated design/required heating mass flow rate at the time step.

### Field: Des Cool Mass Flow [kg/s]

This is the calculated design/required cooling mass flow rate at the time step.

### Line: Peak

This indicates the peak calculation (load or mass flow) over the 24 hour condensed sizing period.

### Line: Peak Vol Flow [m3/s]

For the mass flow rates, this indicates the peak volume flow calculation (m3/s) over the 24 hour condensed sizing period.
