\section{Exporting~ EnergyPlus as a Functional Mock-up Unit for co-simulation}\label{exporting-energyplus-as-a-functional-mock-up-unit-for-co-simulation}

The FMU export of EnergyPlus allows EnergyPlus to be accessed from other simulation environments, as a FMU for co-simulation.

FMUs are formally specified in the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard, an open standard designed to enable links between disparate simulation programs. The standard is available from \href{http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/.\%20}{http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/}.

To export EnergyPlus as a FMU for co-simulation, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has developed a utility which exports EnergyPlus as a FMU for co-simulation. This utility is freely available from \url{http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov}.
