\chapter{View Factor Calculation Program}\label{view-factor-calculation-program}

EnergyPlus has the capability of accepting user defined view factors for special research situations. This option is not recommended for general use because the normal approximate view factor determination within EnergyPlus accounts for such practical things as thermal mass (furniture), and realistic exchange limits. However, when a user desires to supply view factors, this auxiliary program can be used to calculate them for a variety of configurations. The program is named View3D, and was developed at NIST (1). This document will describe how to use the program.
