\section{Running the CoeffConv or CoeffCheck programs}\label{running-the-coeffconv-or-coeffcheck-programs}

EP-Launch can be used to run both the CoeffConv and CoeffCheck programs. CoeffConv and CoeffCheck are two of the options on the Utilities tab in EP-Launch. See the EP-Launch section in this document for more information on how to use EP-Launch with the CoeffConv and CoeffCheck programs.

You can also run both programs as console applications and, because they are small, they are automatically installed with EnergyPlus. You will need to open a command window using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Open a DOS command prompt window (Start -\textgreater{} Programs -\textgreater{} Accessories -\textgreater{} Command Prompt)
\item
  Change to the directory where EnergyPlus is installed (modify the commands below if you did not install EnergyPlus in the default install path):
\end{enumerate}

C:

CD \textbackslash{}\textless{}rootfolder\textgreater{}\textless{}/span\textgreater{}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Change to the specific folder for the coefficient conversion applications:
\end{enumerate}

CD PreProcess\textbackslash{}CoeffConv

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Run the program:
\end{enumerate}

After creating your files as shown above, enter either CoeffConv or CoeffCheck as desired. The folder also contains a ``readme.txt'' file which you can peruse.
