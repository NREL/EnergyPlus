\section{Program Outputs}\label{program-outputs}

As noted earlier, there are three output parameters and they are automatically saved in the CalcSoilSurfTemp.out file. The basic concept and description of three output parameters are as follows.

\textbf{Annual Average Soil Surface Temperature}

This is the annual average value of soil surface temperature.

\textbf{Amplitude of Soil Surface Temperature}

This is the difference between the maximum and minimum soil surface temperature of the whole year divided by two.

\textbf{Phase Constant of Soil Surface Temperature}

This is the time elapsed from the beginning of the year at which the soil surface temperature reaches the minimum value in the year.

These values are placed in the ZoneEarthTube object numeric fields (12, 13, 14) of similar names. The ZoneEarthTube IDD definition with these fields highlighted is included:
