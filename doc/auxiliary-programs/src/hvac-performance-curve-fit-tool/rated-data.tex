\section{Rated Data}\label{rated-data}

The rated data is used to normalize the performance data set. The rated test conditions depend on the equipment type. For DX cooling coil the rated test temperatures are 67°F (19.4°C) indoor coil entering wet bulb, 80°F (26.7°C) indoor coil entering dry bulb and 95°F (35.0°C) outdoor coil entering dry bulb air temperatures per ANSI/AHRI Std. 210/240 (AHRI 2008). If the rated test temperatures are different from the values populated by the tool, then the user may enter the applicable values manually. The rated data can be one of the performance data points depending on the speed or stage. The rated data set is entered in the Cells range ``B11:E11'' of the INPUT tab as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:main-menu-screen-of-the-weather-converter}.
