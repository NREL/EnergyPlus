This tool has been tested on Ubuntu 11 using Libre Office and MS Office Macintosh 2011 machines. But the button for running the macro may not be imported properly on Ubuntu hence users may have to run the tool manually by selecting ``\textbf{ManageCurveFit}'' and ``\textbf{SaveCurveObjToTextFile}'' subroutine from the macro list.
