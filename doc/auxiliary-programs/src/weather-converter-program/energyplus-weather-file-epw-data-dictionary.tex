\section{EnergyPlus Weather File (EPW) Data Dictionary}\label{energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary}

The ``data dictionary'' for EnergyPlus Weather Data is shown below. Note that semi-colons do NOT terminate lines in the EnergyPlus Weather Data. It helps if you have familiarity with the IDD conventions please view them in the Input Output Reference document. Briefly, we have similar ``\textbackslash{}'' conventions that are important for reading the following tables:

\textbackslash{}minimum, \textbackslash{}minimum\textgreater{} - values for this field must be either \textgreater{} = or \textgreater{} than the following number

\textbackslash{}maximum, \textbackslash{}maximum\textless{} - values for this field must be either \textless{} = or \textless{} than the following number

\textbackslash{}missing - if values in this field are \textgreater{} = the following number, it is considered ``missing'' and missing data rules will apply

\textbackslash{}default - blank fields will receive the following as ``default'' values

\textbackslash{}units - expected units for the field. Standard EnergyPlus units are shown in the Input Output Reference Document.

Note that in the header records where ``date'' is used, the interpretation is shown in the following table.

The Location header record duplicates the information required for the Location Object. When only a Run Period object is used (i.e.~a weather file), then the Location Object Is not needed. When a Run Period and Design Day objects are entered, then the Location on the weather file (as described previously) is used and overrides any Location Object entry.

\begin{lstlisting}

     ...
     An, \field Design Condition Type (COOLING)
       \note same as note on Heating Design Conditions
\end{lstlisting}

The Design Conditions header record encapsulates matching (using WMO\# -- World Meteorological Organization Station Number) design conditions for a weather file location. Currently only those design conditions contained in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2009 are contained in the weather files. These conditions can be used as desired. In addition, Design Day definition files have been created of all World, Canada, and United States Design Conditions.

\end{lstlisting}

Using a heuristic method, the weather converter can determine typical and extreme weather periods for full year weather files. These will then be shown on the Typical/Extreme Periods header record. These are also reported in the statistical report output from the Weather Converter.

The weather converter program can use a full year weather data file to calculate ``undisturbed'' ground temperatures based on temperatures. Since an important part of soil heat transfer includes soil properties such as conductivity, density and specific heat AND these cannot be calculated from simple weather observations, this header record is provided primarilyfor user information. However, with the FC construction option, these are automatically selected (.5 depth) for use if the user does not include values in the Site:GroundTemperature:FcfactorMethod object.

As noted in the statistics report, the ``undisturbed'' ground temperatures calculated by the weather converter should not be used in building losses but are appropriate to be used in the GroundTemperatures:Surface and GroundTemperatures:Deep objects. The reasoning (for building losses) is that these values are too extreme for the soil under a conditioned building. For best results, use the Slab or Basement program described in this document to calculate custom monthly average ground temperatures (see the Ground Heat Transfer section). This is especially important for residential applications and very small buildings. If one of these ground temperature preprocessors is not used, for typical commercial buildings in the USA, a reasonable default value is 2C less than the average indoor space temperature.

\begin{lstlisting}

     A4, \field Holiday 1 Name
     A5, \field Holiday 1 Day
     \note repeat above two fields until Number of Holidays is reached
-- etc to # of Holidays entered
\end{lstlisting}

The Holidays / Daylight Saving header record details the start and end dates of Daylight Saving Time and other special days such as might be recorded for the weather file. These can be used by keying ``Yes'' for appropriate fields in the Run Period Object.

Note: EnergyPlus processed weather files available on the EnergyPlus web site: have neither special days specified nor daylight saving period.

For example, using a RunPeriod:

\begin{lstlisting}

RunPeriod,
  1,                       !- Begin Month
  1,                       !- Begin Day Of Month
  12,                      !- End Month
  31,                      !- End Day Of Month
  Wednesday,               !- Day Of Week For Start Day
  Yes,                     !- Use WeatherFile Holidays/Special Days
  No,                      !- Use WeatherFile DaylightSavingPeriod
  Yes,                     !- Apply Weekend Holiday Rule
  Yes,                     !- Use WeatherFile Rain Indicators
  Yes;                     !- Use WeatherFile Snow Indicators
\end{lstlisting}

Will use any holidays specified in the Holidays / Daylight Saving header record of the weather file but will not use the Daylight Saving Period that is specified there (if any). In addition, the user can specify Special Day Periods via the Special Day Period object and/or Daylight Saving Period via the Daylight Saving Period object to additionally specify these items.

\begin{lstlisting}
COMMENTS 1, A1 \field Comments_1
COMMENTS 2, A1 \field Comments_2
\end{lstlisting}

The Comment header records may provide additional information about the weather data source or other information which may not fit in other header record formats.

\begin{lstlisting}

     N1, \field Number of Data Periods
     N2, \field Number of Records per hour

\end{lstlisting}

A weather file may contain several ``data periods'' though this is not required (and, in fact, may be detrimental). In addition, a weather file may contain multiple records per hour BUT these must match the Number of Time Steps In Hour for the simulation. Multiple interval data files can be valued when you want to be sure of the weather values for each time step (rather than relying on ``interpolated'' weather data). A weather file may also contain several consecutive years of weather data. EnergyPlus will automatically process the extra years when the Number of Years field is used in the RunPeriod object. Sorry - there is no way to jump into a year in the middle of the EPW file.

Note that a Run Period object may not cross Data Period boundary lines.

For those interested in creating their own weather data in the CSV or EPW formats or reading the .csv and .epw files that are produced by the Weather Converter program, the fields are shown in the following ``IDD'' description. Items shown in bold are used directly in the EnergyPlus program.

\subsubsection{Field: Data Source and Uncertainty Flags}\label{field-data-source-and-uncertainty-flags}

The data source and uncertainty flags from various formats (usually shown with each field) are consolidated in the E/E+ EPW format. More is shown about Data Source and Uncertainty in Data Sources/Uncertainty section later in this document.

\subsubsection{Field: Dry Bulb Temperature}\label{field-dry-bulb-temperature}

This is the dry bulb temperature in C at the time indicated. Note that this is a full numeric field (i.e.~23.6) and not an integer representation with tenths. Valid values range from -70°C to 70°C. Missing value for this field is 99.9.

\subsubsection{Field: Dew Point Temperature}\label{field-dew-point-temperature}

This is the dew point temperature in C at the time indicated. Note that this is a full numeric field (i.e.~23.6) and not an integer representation with tenths. Valid values range from -70°C to 70°C. Missing value for this field is 99.9.

\subsubsection{Field: Relative Humidity}\label{field-relative-humidity}

This is the Relative Humidity in percent at the time indicated. Valid values range from 0\% to 110\%. Missing value for this field is 999.

\subsubsection{Field: Atmospheric Station Pressure}\label{field-atmospheric-station-pressure}

This is the station pressure in Pa at the time indicated. Valid values range from 31,000 to 120,000. (These values were chosen from the standard barometric pressure for all elevations of the World). Missing value for this field is 999999.

\subsubsection{Field: Extraterrestrial Horizontal Radiation}\label{field-extraterrestrial-horizontal-radiation}

This is the Extraterrestrial Horizontal Radiation in Wh/m2. It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. It should have a minimum value of 0; missing value for this field is 9999.

\subsubsection{Field: Extraterrestrial Direct Normal Radiation}\label{field-extraterrestrial-direct-normal-radiation}

This is the Extraterrestrial Direct Normal Radiation in Wh/m2. (Amount of solar radiation in Wh/m2 received on a surface normal to the rays of the sun at the top of the atmosphere during the number of minutes preceding the time indicated). It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. It should have a minimum value of 0; missing value for this field is 9999.

\subsubsection{Field: Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity}\label{field-horizontal-infrared-radiation-intensity}

This is the Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity in Wh/m2. If it is missing, it is calculated from the Opaque Sky Cover field as shown in the following explanation. It should have a minimum value of 0; missing value for this field is 9999.

\begin{equation}
Horizontal_{IR} = \epsilon\sigma T^4_{drybulb}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(Horizontal_{IR}\) is the horizontal IR intensity \{W/m\(^{2}\)\}
\item
  \(\epsilon\) is the sky emissivity
\item
  \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.6697e-8 W/m\(^{2}\)-K\(^{4}\)
\item
  \(T_{drybulb}\) is the drybulb temperature \{K\}
\end{itemize}

The sky emissivity is given by

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \left( 0.787 +0.764 \ln\left(\frac{T_{dewpoint}}{273}\right)\right)\left( 1 + 0.0224N - 0.0035N^2 + 0.00028N^3 \right)
\end{equation}

where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(T_{dewpoint}\) is the dewpoint temperature \{K\}
\item
  \(N\) is the opaque sky cover \{tenths\}
\end{itemize}

Example: Clear sky (\(N = 0\) ), \(T_{drybulb} = 273+20 = 293 K\) , \(T_{dewpoint} = 273+10 = 283 K\) :

\(\epsilon = 0.787 + 0.764*0.036 = 0.815\)

\(Horizontal_{IR} = 0.815*5.6697e-8*(293^4) = 340.6 W/m^2\)

References (Walton, 1983) (Clark, Allen, 1978) for these calculations are contained in the references section at the end of this list of fields.

\subsubsection{Field: Global Horizontal Radiation}\label{field-global-horizontal-radiation}

This is the Global Horizontal Radiation in Wh/m2.

It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. It should have a minimum value of 0; missing value for this field is 9999.

\subsubsection{Field: Direct Normal Radiation}\label{field-direct-normal-radiation}

This is the Direct Normal Radiation in Wh/m2. (Amount of solar radiation in Wh/m2 received directly from the solar disk on a surface perpendicular to the sun's rays, during the number of minutes preceding the time indicated.) If the field is missing (\(\ge 9999\) ) or invalid (\(<0\) ), it is set to 0. Counts of such missing values are totaled and presented at the end of the runperiod.

\subsubsection{Field: Diffuse Horizontal Radiation}\label{field-diffuse-horizontal-radiation}

This is the Diffuse Horizontal Radiation in Wh/m2. (Amount of solar radiation in Wh/m2 received from the sky (excluding the solar disk) on a horizontal surface during the number of minutes preceding the time indicated.) If the field is missing (\(\ge 9999\) ) or invalid (\(<0\) ), it is set to 0. Counts of such missing values are totaled and presented at the end of the runperiod.

\subsubsection{Field: Global Horizontal Illuminance}\label{field-global-horizontal-illuminance}

This is the Global Horizontal Illuminance in lux. (Average total amount of direct and diffuse illuminance in hundreds of lux received on a horizontal surface during the number of minutes preceding the time indicated.) It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. It should have a minimum value of 0; missing value for this field is 999999 and will be considered missing if greater than or equal to 999900.

\subsubsection{Field: Direct Normal Illuminance}\label{field-direct-normal-illuminance}

This is the Wind Direction in degrees where the convention is that North = 0.0, East = 90.0, South = 180.0, West = 270.0. (Wind direction in degrees at the time indicated. If calm, direction equals zero.) Values can range from 0 to 360. Missing value is 999.

\subsubsection{Field: Wind Speed}\label{field-wind-speed}

This is the wind speed in m/sec. (Wind speed at time indicated.) Values can range from 0 to 40. Missing value is 999.

\subsubsection{Field: Total Sky Cover}\label{field-total-sky-cover}

This is the value for total sky cover (tenths of coverage). (i.e.~1 is 1/10 covered. 10 is total coverage). (Amount of sky dome in tenths covered by clouds or obscuring phenomena at the hour indicated at the time indicated.) Minimum value is 0; maximum value is 10; missing value is 99.

\subsubsection{Field: Opaque Sky Cover}\label{field-opaque-sky-cover}

This is the value for opaque sky cover (tenths of coverage). (i.e.~1 is 1/10 covered. 10 is total coverage). (Amount of sky dome in tenths covered by clouds or obscuring phenomena that prevent observing the sky or higher cloud layers at the time indicated.) This is not used unless the field for Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity is missing and then it is used to calculate Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity. Minimum value is 0; maximum value is 10; missing value is 99.

\subsubsection{Field: Visibility}\label{field-visibility}

This is the value for visibility in km. (Horizontal visibility at the time indicated.) It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. Missing value is 9999.

\subsubsection{Field: Ceiling Height}\label{field-ceiling-height}

This is the value for ceiling height in m. (77777 is unlimited ceiling height. 88888 is cirroform ceiling.) It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. Missing value is 99999.

\subsubsection{Field: Present Weather Observation}\label{field-present-weather-observation}

If the value of the field is 0, then the observed weather codes are taken from the following field. If the value of the field is 9, then ``missing'' weather is assumed. Since the primary use of these fields (Present Weather Observation and Present Weather Codes) is for rain/wet surfaces, a missing observation field or a missing weather code implies no rain.

\subsubsection{Field: Present Weather Codes}\label{field-present-weather-codes}

The present weather codes field is assumed to follow the TMY2 conventions for this field. Note that though this field may be represented as numeric (e.g.~in the CSV format), it is really a text field of 9 single digits. This convention along with values for each ``column'' (left to right) is presented in Table~\ref{table:weather-codes-field-interpretation}. Note that some formats (e.g.~TMY) does not follow this convention - as much as possible, the present weather codes are converted to this convention during WeatherConverter processing. Also note that the most important fields are those representing liquid precipitation - where the surfaces of the building would be wet. EnergyPlus uses ``Snow Depth'' to determine if snow is on the ground.

For example, a Present Weather Observation (previous field) of 0 and a Present Weather Codes field of 929999999 notes that there is heavy rain for this data period (usually hourly but depends on the number of intervals per hour field in the ``Data Periods'' record).

\subsubsection{Field: Precipitable Water}\label{field-precipitable-water}

This is the value for Precipitable Water in mm. (This is not rain - rain is inferred from the PresWeathObs field but a better result is from the Liquid Precipitation Depth field)). It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations (primarily due to the unreliability of the reporting of this value). Missing value is 999.

\subsubsection{Field: Aerosol Optical Depth}\label{field-aerosol-optical-depth}

This is the value for Aerosol Optical Depth in thousandths. It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. Missing value is .999.

\subsubsection{Field: Snow Depth}\label{field-snow-depth}

This is the value for Snow Depth in cm. This field is used to tell when snow is on the ground and, thus, the ground reflectance may change. Missing value is 999.

\subsubsection{Field: Days Since Last Snowfall}\label{field-days-since-last-snowfall}

This is the value for Days Since Last Snowfall. It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. Missing value is 99.

\subsubsection{Field: Albedo}\label{field-albedo}

The ratio (unitless) of reflected solar irradiance to global horizontal irradiance. It is not currently used in EnergyPlus.

\subsubsection{Field: Liquid Precipitation Depth}\label{field-liquid-precipitation-depth}

The amount of liquid precipitation (mm) observed at the indicated time for the period indicated in the liquid
precipitation quantity field. If this value is not missing, then it is used and overrides the rain indicator (IsRain) as

field is missing or zero, it is set to 2.0 mm.

\subsubsection{Field: Liquid Precipitation Quantity}\label{field-liquid-precipitation-quantity}

The period of accumulation (hr) for the liquid precipitation depth field. It is not currently used in EnergyPlus.
