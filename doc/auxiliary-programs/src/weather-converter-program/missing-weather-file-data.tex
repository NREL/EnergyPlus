\section{Missing Weather File Data}\label{missing-weather-file-data}

The following data contains ``missing'' descriptors; a new concept not introduced previously in our IDD conventions. In this case, it will be processed as though those values are ``missing'' in the weather conversions. This may not always be desirable though the weather processor will fill in ``missing'' value with something ``appropriate''. Eventually, these missing values will be available through the weather processor. Until then, the following are used for initial missing conditions. When a valid value is encountered from weather data, however, it will become the new ``missing'' replacement value:
