 |  | |     |     echo of EnergyPlus input line
 |  | |     |
 |  | |    line number ( if the current line is being skipped
 |  | |                  by " ##if... " etc, this is indicated
 |  | |                  by printing "- 123 -" instead of
 |  | |                  "* 123 *" in the line number field;
 |  | |                  if the current line is part of a
 |  | |                  macro command, it is indicated by
