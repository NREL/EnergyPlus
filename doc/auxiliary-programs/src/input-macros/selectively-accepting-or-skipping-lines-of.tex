\section{Selectively Accepting or Skipping Lines of Input}\label{selectively-accepting-or-skipping-lines-of-input}

The \textbf{\#\#if} series of commands is used to selectively accept or skip lines of input according to the following sequence:

```idf \textbf{\#\#if} \{condition1\} line1a line1b \ldots{}

\textbf{\#\#elseif} \{condition2\} line2a line2b \ldots{}

\textbf{\#\#elseif} \{condition3\textbf{\}} line3a line3b \ldots{}

\textbf{\#\#else} line N a line N b \ldots{}

\textbf{\#\#endif}

Then the lines that will be included into the EnergyPlus input stream are:

\begin{lstlisting}

If {condition 1} is TRUE,
  line1a
  line1b
  ...

  otherwise

  If {condition 2} is TRUE,
  line2a
  line2b
  ...

  otherwise

  If {condition 3} is TRUE,
  line3a
  line3b
  ...

  otherwise

  If {condition 1}, {condition 2}, {condition 3} are all FALSE.
  line N a
  line N b
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

There are six different \textbf{\#\#if\ldots{}} commands:

Command

Result

\textbf{\#\#ifdef}

\begin{description}
\item[\{macro name\}]
if macro name defined, include following lines
\end{description}

\textbf{\#\#ifndef}

\begin{description}
\item[\{macro name\}]
if macro name NOT defined, include following lines
\end{description}

\textbf{\#\#if}

\begin{description}
\item[\{condition\}]
if condition is TRUE, include following lines
\end{description}

\textbf{\#\#elseif}

\begin{description}
\item[\{condition\}]
if condition is TRUE, and previous conditions are FALSE, include
\end{description}

following lines

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{\#\#else}]
if all previous conditions are FALSE, include following lines
\item[\textbf{\#\#endif}]
indicates the end of the if block
\end{description}

Notes:

\{macro name\} is explained in section \emph{Defining Blocks of Input}, below.

\{condition\} is 0 or BLANK meaning FALSE, and any other character meaning TRUE.

\textbf{\#\#ifdef} and \textbf{\#\#ifndef} do not have corresponding \textbf{\#\#elseif} commands, but they do have

\begin{lstlisting}
   corresponding  **\#\#else**  and  **\#\#endif**  commands.
\end{lstlisting}
