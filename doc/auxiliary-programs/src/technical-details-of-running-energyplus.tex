\chapter{Technical Details of Running EnergyPlus}\label{technical-details-of-running-energyplus}

This section will contain the details of running EnergyPlus - more (and some duplicated) information on EP-Launch (basic discussion included in the Getting Started manual) and ``by hand'' - describing the batch files that are included with the install. The first parts of this section deal with using EnergyPlus on a Wintel/Windows OS system. Though similar commands can be used on other OS - such as Linux, they will not be exactly the same commands (usually).
