\chapter{Weather Converter Program}\label{weather-converter-program}

The Weather Converter program is stored in the EnergyPlus folder area under ``PreProcess'' and subsequently in the ``WeatherConverter'' folder.

To perform annual/run period simulations in EnergyPlus, one needs weather data. Most weather data is still issued in an hour by hour (hourly) format though as you will see, EnergyPlus and its weather converter can accept data that has a finer resolution on the data (such as every 10 or 15 minutes).

The special weather format (EPW) used in EnergyPlus is a simple, ascii format as is common in the rest of the inputs for EnergyPlus.
