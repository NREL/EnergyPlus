\section{Using OSC (Other Side Coefficients) to create controlled panels}\label{using-osc-other-side-coefficients-to-create-controlled-panels}

The Other Side Coefficient (OSC) equation permits setting either the outside surface temperature or the outside air temperature to a constant value or a scheduled value based on the size of the first input parameter, N1. The original temperature equation was:

\begin{equation}
T = N_2 T_{zone} + N_3 T_{oadb} + N_4 N_5 + N_6 T_{grnd} + N_7 W_{spd} T_{oadb}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(T\) = Outside Air Temperature when N1 (Combined convective/radiative film Coeff) \textgreater{} 0
\item
  \(T\) = Exterior Surface Temperature when N1 (Combined convective/radiative film Coeff) \textless{} = 0
\item
  \(T_{zone}\) = MAT = Temperature of the zone being simulated (°C)
\item
  \(T_{oadb}\) = Dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (°C)
\item
  \(T_{grnd}\) = Temperature of the ground (°C) Wspd = Outdoor wind speed (m/sec)
\end{itemize}

The coefficients N\(_{2}\), N\(_{3}\), N\(_{4}\), N\(_{6}\), and N\(_{7}\) scale the contribution of the various terms that follow them.~ In the case of N\(_{4}\), it is followed by another term N\(_{5}\).~ This is a constant temperature that can also be overridden by a scheduled value. Note that in some EnergyPlus documentation, the N's are given as C's.

This object has been changed to permit the outside temperature, T, to be controlled to a set point temperature that is specified as N\(_{5}\) or comes from the schedule A2.

Note that since the surface that contains the panel subsurfaces (that must be called doors in EnergyPlus) receives that same outside temperature as the panels, it should have a construction with a very high thermal resistance to essentially take it out of the room heat balance calculation.

An Example input file object is shown below.

\end{lstlisting}

This object results in the following equation for T:

T = 1.0*Tlast +0.95*(Tsetpoint -- TzoneAir)~~ (with limits)

The result of this is that the surface temperature, T, will be changed to the temperature that will force the zone air temperature to the setpoint providing the temperature limits are not reached. When the zone air temperature is at the setpoint, T remains at the value it had in the prior time step.
