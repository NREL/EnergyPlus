\section{Rain Flag}\label{rain-flag}

\emph{Why is my exterior convection coefficient value 1000?}

When the outside environment indicates that it is raining, the exterior surfaces (exposed to wind) are assumed to be wet. The convection coefficient is set to a very high number (1000) and the outside temperature used for the surface will be the wet-bulb temperature. (If you choose to report this variable, you will see 1000 as its value.)
