\section{Cavity Algorithm Model}\label{cavity-algorithm-model}

\emph{Reading the documentation, I'm wondering if the Cavity algorithm is usable for other double facade types or only Trombe wall?~ In other words, does Cavity implicitly presume that the inner wall is highly solar absorbent and so generate specific convection?}

The Trombe wall convection algorithm is applicable to just about any vertical cavity with a high aspect ratio and relatively narrow width. I'm not sure if a double facade cavity would meet the aspect ratio requirement. But I do know the Trombe wall algorithm is not picky about whether the inner wall is highly absorbant, or about any particular properties of the walls. Actually the same basic algorithm is used by the window model to calculate the convection between the two panes of a window. The full reference is ISO 15099.
