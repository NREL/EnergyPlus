\section{Daylight Modeling}\label{daylight-modeling}

\emph{Why isn't my lighting energy being reduced with a daylighting system?}

In order to see changes in the lighting electric power consumption due to daylighting, the Fraction Replaceable in the \textbf{Lights} input object must be set to 1.0. This is documented in the I/O reference, and also a warning is generated in the ERR file.
