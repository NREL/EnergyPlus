\section{Comparing EnergyPlus to Other Programs}\label{comparing-energyplus-to-other-programs}

A paper comparing and contrasting Energy Simulation Programs can be found here:

\url{http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2005/BS05_0231_238.pdf}

As this paper was published in 2005, it is out of date (at least with current EnergyPlus capabilities).

The feature highlights from EnergyPlus releases can be seen here:

In addition you can see how EnergyPlus compares to other programs (which have submitted their models) in our testing reports:
