\section{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}

If you're familiar with building simulation, use the 300+ example files that come with the program and the Input/Output Reference to help you.

If you're new to building simulation, read and work through the tutorials in the ``Getting Started'' document or visit the online tutorial, \url{http://www.vibyor.com} (tutorial was created by Prof.~Vishal Garg from IIIT Hyberabad, India).

Another avenue you might use is the EnergyPlus Example File Generator (EEFG) program, which will not only produce an input file for your later use, but also run your specifications on EnergyPlus and send you the results. EEFG is available through the interface page referenced above or \url{http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/inputs/}.
