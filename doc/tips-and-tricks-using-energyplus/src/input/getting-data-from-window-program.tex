\section{Getting data from WINDOW program}\label{getting-data-from-window-program}

The WINDOW program is published from LBNL at \url{http://windows.lbl.gov/software}. More specifics on the program and its details are shown in the Input Output Reference under ``Importing Windows from WINDOW program'' topic.

\subsection{EnergyPlus IDF Excerpt Data}\label{energyplus-idf-excerpt-data}

The preferred method of using WINDOW data in EnergyPlus is to excerpt or ``report'' a specific Window from the Window library screen (see below):

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 1

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image001.jpg}
\caption{WINDOW screen for exporting IDF Window specifications \protect \label{fig:window-screen-for-exporting-idf-window}}
\end{figure}

The file can then be saved at a location of your choice and added into your overall simulation IDF file.

\subsection{WINDOW Data File}\label{window-data-file}

The other ``older'' option for creating data for EnergyPlus is to use the ``EnergyPlus'' option above and create a WindowDataFile. The general format of this data is described in the following paragraphs and must use the Construction:WindowDataFile object and an external file to be used in EnergyPlus. While this is a convenient small file (that can contain multiple windows), there is no way to import this file back into WINDOW and obtain the above, more preferred method.

Please note that there is a bug in WINDOW 5 that causes two of the lines in the EnergyPlus data file to be joined. This bug is fixed in versions of Window 5.02 (and above). To be sure, you can check the data file for a line that looks like:

GLAZING SYSTEM OPTICAL DATAAngle~~~~ 0~~~ 10~~~ 20~~~ 30~~~ 40~~~ 50~~~ 60~~~ 70~~~ 80~~~ 90 Hemis

The fixed version of the program will not show the above line; rather, there will be two lines such as shown below. If you have the above condition, with an editor you would break this into two lines:

GLAZING SYSTEM OPTICAL DATA

Angle~~~~ 0~~~ 10~~~ 20~~~ 30~~~ 40~~~ 50~~~ 60~~~ 70~~~ 80~~~ 90 Hemis

In EnergyPlus, the Window data file is searched for each ``Construction:WindowDataFile'' object in the EnergyPlus input. This object has a very simple form:

Construction:WindowDataFile,

ConstructionName,

FileName; ! Default is Window5DataFile.dat in the ``run'' folder.

If there is a window called ConstructionName on the Window data file, the data for that window is read from the file and the following EnergyPlus objects and their names are created. The ``W5'' prefixed to these names indicates that the object originated in the Window5 data file.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{WindowMaterial:Glazing} for each of the glass layers. They will be named \textbf{W5:ConstructionName:GLASS1}, \textbf{W5:ConstructionName:GLASS2} , etc.
\item
  \textbf{WindowMaterial:Gas} or \textbf{WindowMaterial:GasMixture} for each of the gap layers. They will be named \textbf{W5:ConstructionName:GAP1}, \textbf{W5:ConstructionName:GAP2} , etc.
\item
  \textbf{WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider} (if the window on the Window5 data file has a frame and/or divider). It will be named \textbf{W5:ConstructionName}. This WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider will be assigned to any window on the input file that has a construction called ``ConstructionName'' \emph{even if that window has~ referenced another WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider (i.e., if WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider Name for that window is specified).} In this case a warning will result.
\end{itemize}

Note that:

An entry on the WINDOW data file usually has just one glazing system. It is also possible to have an entry with two glazing systems separated by a horizontal or vertical mullion. In this case, the two glazing systems can have different dimensions and different properties. For example, one of the two glazing systems could be single glazed and the other could be double glazed. An example~ of the two glazing system case is given in the sample WINDOW data file shown below (although in this case the properties of the two glazing systems are the same).

EnergyPlus handles the ``one glazing system'' and ``two glazing systems'' cases differently. If there is one glazing system, the glazing system height and width from the Window5 data file are not used. Instead, the window dimensions are obtained from the window vertices that have been specified on the IDF file. However, a warning message will result if the height or width calculated from the window's vertex inputs differs from the corresponding Window5 data file values by more than 10\%. This warning is given since the effective frame and edge-of-glass conductances on the WINDOW data file can depend on the window dimensions if the frame is non-uniform, i.e., consists of sections with different values of width, projection, or thermal properties.

If the WINDOW data file entry has two glazing systems, System1 and System2, the following happens, as shown in the figure below. Assume that the original window is called WinOriginal. System1 is assigned to WinOriginal. Then EnergyPlus automatically creates a second window, called WinOriginal:2, and assigns System2 to it. The dimensions of WinOriginal are ignored; the dimensions of System1 on the data file are assigned to it, but the position of the lower left-hand vertex of WinOriginal is retained. The dimensions of System2 on the data file are assigned to WinOriginal:2. The lower left-hand vertex of WinOriginal:2 is determined from the mullion orientation and width.

\textbf{Note: WinOriginal would have been the IDF window definition -- it's dimensions will be overridden by the systems dimensions from the Window data file. Two windows will be made and called WinOriginal and WinOriginal:2.}

\caption{Window Glazing system with dual glazing constructions \protect \label{fig:window-glazing-system-with-dual-glazing}}
\end{figure}

The Window Data File contains no information on shading devices. See ``Specify the Material Name of the Shading Device'' under WindowShadingControl for a method to attach a shading layer to windows read in from this file.

Following is an example WINDOW data file for a slider window with two identical double low-E glazing systems separated by a horizontal mullion. Each system has a frame and divider. Note that all dimensions, such as glazing height and width, are in millimeters; when EnergyPlus reads the file these are converted to meters. Following the data file example is a description of the contents of the file. That data used by EnergyPlus is shown in bold.
