\section{Converting Older Version EnergyPlus Files}\label{converting-older-version-energyplus-files}

\emph{Can I convert an older file to a newer version of EnergyPlus?}

If the older version is from a previous release (since Version 7.2), then yes.  Use the IDF Version Updater utility in the PreProcess folder of your EnergyPlus install.  Simply select the file that needs to be updated by finding it on your computer and the click on the Update File button. This will update the older IDF file to the latest version of EnergyPlus installed on the computer.

If the older version is older than Version 7.2, then you must use the multiple transition program. You can request the transition programs from the \href{https://energyplushelp.freshdesk.com/}{EnergyPlus Help Desk Support} site.  After clicking on this link, go to the ``downloads'' tab.

The Multiple Transition folder is set up on the EnergyPlus install.

Unzip the file into the MultipleTransition folder and use the IDF Converter GUI program to transition your older files. The IDF converter can also save the transitioned file for each intermediate version, if desired.
