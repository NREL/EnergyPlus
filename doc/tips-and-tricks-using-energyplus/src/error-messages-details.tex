\chapter{Error Messages (Details)}\label{error-messages-details}

Error messages are produced from several parts of EnergyPlus and at several times prior to and during Input Processing (comparing IDF fields/values to IDD requirements); during GetInput for each module (further checking for correct values from the IDF); during Sizing operations; during Warmup operations; and finally during simulation of the environments.

It is easy to separate the Sizing and Warmup errors from the rest. A summary is provided at the end of the simulation:

\begin{lstlisting}
************* EnergyPlus Warmup Error Summary. During Warmup: 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors.
************* EnergyPlus Sizing Error Summary. During Sizing: 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors.
************* EnergyPlus Completed Successfully-- 1 Warning; 0 Severe Errors; Elapsed Time = 00hr 00min  6.58sec
\end{lstlisting}
