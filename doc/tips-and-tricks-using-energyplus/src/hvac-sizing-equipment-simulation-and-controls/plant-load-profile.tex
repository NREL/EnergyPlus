\section{Plant Load Profile}\label{plant-load-profile}

The Plant Load Profile object is used to ``pass'' a load to the plant where the plant meets this load. The load profile places an inlet and outlet water temperature and a mass flow rate at the inlet to the plant loop. This is where you will need to focus when you try to alter the boiler performance.
