\section{Separating Ventilation Loads v. Zone Loads}\label{separating-ventilation-loads-v.-zone-loads}

\emph{Can I determine the ventilation load for PAU in PAU~ + FCUs system? If can, how to split the total cooling load into room load and ventilation load for PAU sizing in energyplus?}

\emph{In the HTML report, ``Nominal total capacity {[}W{]}'' (EquipmentSummary) and ``Design Load {[}W{]}'' (HVACSizingSummary) can be found. Are they equal to ``Total cooling load'' and ``Room load''? (i.e.~Ventilation load = ``nominal total capacity'' - ``Design Load'')}

PAU -- Primary Fresh Air Handling Unit or DOAS -- Dedicated Outdoor Air Unit

FCU -- Fan Coil Unit

There are several ways to split the total cooling load into room load and ventilation load for PAU sizing in EnergyPlus:

1)~~~In the eio output, section, the heating and cooling loads reported there are the peak *sensible* loads for each zone, without any ventilation load. These are the same values reported as ``Design Load'' in the HVACSizingSummary table report.

2)~~~In the EquipmentSummary table report, the component capacities reported there are the total (cooling, sensible for heating) output capacities include any ventilation load if it impacts that component.

3)~~~If you have a central air loop that serves only the ventilation load, and zone equipment that serves only the zone load, there is an autosizing option in Sizing:System that should autosize the central system appropriately.

From example file 5ZoneCoolBeam.idf:

\begin{lstlisting}

Sizing:System,
  VAV Sys 1, !- AirLoop Name
  VentilationRequirement, !- Type of Load to Size On
  autosize, !- Design Outdoor Air Flow Rate {m3/s}
  1.0, !- Minimum System Air Flow Ratio
\end{lstlisting}

When you run a simulation, if you want to report ventilation loads, the following Output:Variable names are available:
