\section{System not Cooling}\label{system-not-cooling}

\emph{I built a very simple system 5 zones VAV no reheat to understand how a E+ system is put together. The results show that the cooling coil is not seeing a load. I then build the same HVACTemplate system and made sure all the details are exactly the same. The template works but not my system.}

It is much easier to use HVACTemplate objects to set up your system. All required supporting objects are set up for you. Notice in your 5Zone input file, you have specified AHU1CCController for BOTH cooling coil controller lists. The second controller list should use controller name AHU2CCController. The 5Zone file worked when I used the correct controller name.

\begin{lstlisting}

AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList,
      AHU1SystemController,    !- Name
      Controller:WaterCoil,       !- Controller Type 1
      AHU1CCController;        !- Controller Name 1


  AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList,
      AHU2SystemController,    !- Name
      Controller:WaterCoil,       !- Controller Type 1
      AHU1CCController;        !- Controller Name 1
\end{lstlisting}
