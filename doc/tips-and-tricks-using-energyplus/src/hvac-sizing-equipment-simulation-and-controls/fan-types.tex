\section{Fan Types}\label{fan-types}

\emph{I am confused about the differences between the different fan types.~ Can you explain?}

In short:

Fan:ConstantVolume is a constant volume, continuous operation fan which can be turned on and off via a schedule.

Fan:OnOff is similar to the one above, but it cycles itself on and off as required by its thermostat \ldots{} all during the scheduled operation period. This is a typical mode of operation for a home furnace.

Fan:VariableVolume runs continuously during the Schedule period, but varies its volume to meet the heating or cooling demand.

Consult the \href{InputOutputReference.pdf}{Input Output Reference document} (group Fans) for additional information.
