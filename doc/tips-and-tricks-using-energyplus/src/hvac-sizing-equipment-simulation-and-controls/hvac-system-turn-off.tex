\section{HVAC System Turn Off}\label{hvac-system-turn-off}

\emph{My HVAC system won't turn off even when my availability schedule is 0 (off).}

The night cycle option is set to Cycle On Any in the HVACTemplate:System:Unitary object. This will turn on the AC system. Change the night cycle option to Stay Off and the system shuts down correctly. For future reference, an indicator of night cycle operation is the on one time step, off the next type of operation.
