\section{Datasets aka Libraries}\label{datasets-aka-libraries}

EnergyPlus uses the term DataSets for what many would call libraries. These files are included, for the most part, in the instalation package but may be available from other sites (such as the helpdesk or Yahoo Groups).

There are two flavors of DataSets: \textbf{simple} and \textbf{Macro}. Some sets have files in both camps (for example, Solar Collectors). Both flavors contain IDF objects ready to be put into EnergyPlus input files. With the simple datasets, you may need to use a text editor or the IDF Editor to search the file for the one you want to use.~ With the macro datsets and a simply structured imf (input macro file), you can name the item you want to include. (The macro program is described in the \href{file:///E:/Docs4PDFs/AuxiliaryPrograms.pdf}{Auxiliary Programs document}).

Primary documentation for each dataset is found in the \href{file:///E:/Docs4PDFs/OutputDetailsAndExamples.pdf}{Output Details and Examples document}. Highlights of some datasets are given here.
