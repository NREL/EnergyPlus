This file (Locations-DesignDays.xls) can be found in the MacroDataSets folder. While not strictly a macro file, it leads one to be able to download the ASHRAE design day definitions from the EnergyPlus website. The spreadsheet format contains a sheet for each of the WMO regions as well as the California Climate Zones, specifically sheets included are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Readme -- an upfront readme page
\item
  WMO1 Africa
\item
  WMO2 Asia
\item
  WMO3 South America
\item
  WMO4 North \& Central America
\item
  CZ Files -- California Climate Zones
\item
  WMO5 Southwest Pacific
\item
  WMO6 Europe
\item
  WMO7 Antarctica
\end{itemize}

Each WMO (World Meteorological Organization) page contains the countries represented, specific cities that have design conditions data from ASHRAE, a link to the full imf file with location, daylighting saving and design day definitions as well as a link to that region's weather page on the EnergyPlus website. Pressing the links here will allow you to download the files.
