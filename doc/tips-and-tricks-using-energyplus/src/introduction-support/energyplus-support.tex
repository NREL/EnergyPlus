\section{EnergyPlus Support}\label{energyplus-support}

The primary EnergyPlus support site is supplied at: \url{http://energyplus.helpserve.com}

The site is monitored by EnergyPlus developers and questions are attempted to be answered in a timely manner. Standard EnergyPlus support is provided free of charge by the U.S. Deparment of Energy, as part of a continuing effort to improve the EnergyPlus building simulation tool. Expedited, priority support may be available from other sources. The helpdesk has a files area where important (after release) files may be put as well as the storage for the Transition file set that are prior to the current release.

\url{http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/EP/ep_consult.html} is a list of EnergyPlus consultants.

Yahoo™ Groups is also used as a peer to peer discussion group. To join the group (which now has about 2,600 participants), visit \href{http://groups.yahoo.com/EnergyPlus_Support}{http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus\_Support} The Yahoo group has some file storage capabilities and that is also where the Meteonorm™ files that supplement the primary EnergyPlus weather data are housed. The Yahoo group may not be monitored by EnergyPlus developers.

A similar Yahoo group has been set up for collaborative developers.
