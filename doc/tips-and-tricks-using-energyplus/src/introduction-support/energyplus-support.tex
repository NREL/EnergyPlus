\textbf{Please refer to the Support page for up to date information}: \url{https://energyplus.net/support}

The primary EnergyPlus support site is supplied at: \url{http://energyplus.helpserve.com}

The site is monitored by EnergyPlus developers and questions are attempted to be answered in a timely manner. Standard EnergyPlus support is provided free of charge by the U.S. Deparment of Energy, as part of a continuing effort to improve the EnergyPlus building simulation tool. Expedited, priority support may be available from other sources. The helpdesk has a files area where important (after release) files may be put as well as the storage for the Transition file set that are prior to the current release.
