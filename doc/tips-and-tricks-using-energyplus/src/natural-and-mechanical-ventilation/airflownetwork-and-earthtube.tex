\section{AirflowNetwork and EarthTube}\label{airflownetwork-and-earthtube}

\emph{When I use an Earthtube with an AirFlowNetwork, I get a ``Orphan Object'' warning.}

Currently, Earthtube and AirFlowNetworks do not work together.~ If both objects co-exist, the AirflowNetwork mode supersedes the Earthtube mode at two control choices. Since this causes the Earthtube objects to not be used, the ``orphan'' warning appears.

There are four control choices in the second field of the AirflowNetwork Simulation object (spaces included for readability)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  MULTIZONE WITH DISTRIBUTION
\item
  MULTIZONE WITHOUT DISTRIBUTION
\item
  MULTIZONE WITH DISTRIBUTION ONLY DURING FAN OPERATION
\item
  NO MULTIZONE OR DISTRIBUTION
\end{itemize}

When the first two choices are selected, the AirflowNetwork model takes over airflow calculation. The earthtube objects are not used in the airflow calculation, causing the ``orphan'' warning. The example file, AirflowNetwork\_Multizone\_SmallOffice.idf, uses the first choice.~ When the second choice is used, the AirflowNetwork model is only used during HVAC operation time. During system off time, the earthtube model is used to calculate airflows.~ Thus, no ``orphan'' warning will be given, but the earthtube may be being used less than expected.~ The example file, AirflowNetwork\_Simple\_House.idf, uses the third choice.
