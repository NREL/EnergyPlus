\section{Output Variable Definition}\label{output-variable-definition}

In order to define output variables in your simulation, you must place the following statement in your input file:

\begin{lstlisting}

Output:VariableDictionary,IDF;
\end{lstlisting}

Then you can cut and paste from the rdd file directly into your idf file. You must first run your simulation to create the rdd file. Output variables found in the rdd file are specific to the simulation and are based on the objects used in your input file.

\begin{lstlisting}

Output:Variable,*,System Node Temp,hourly; !- HVAC Average [C]
\end{lstlisting}

To get only information for a single node, change to: Output:Variable,``The Name of the Node'',System Node Temp,hourly; !- HVAC Average {[}C{]}.

Where ``The Name of the Node'' is the specific node name for one or more nodes.
