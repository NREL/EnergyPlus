\chapter{Validation and Testing}\label{validation-and-testing}

An important ongoing part of EnergyPlus development is testing using industry standard methods as major builds are completed.
The goal is to make EnergyPlus as bug-free as possible. Three major types of tests are currently conducted:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Analytical tests:
\item
  HVAC tests, based on ASHRAE Research Project 865
\item
  Building fabric tests, based on ASHRAE Research Project 1052
\item
  Comparative tests:
\item
  ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140-2007
\item
  International Energy Agency Solar Heating and Cooling Programme (IEA SHC) BESTest (Building Energy Simulation Test) methods not yet in Standard 140
\item
  EnergyPlus HVAC Component Comparative tests
\item
  EnergyPlus Global Heat Balance tests
\item
  Release and executable tests
\end{itemize}
