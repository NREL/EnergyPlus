\section{Weather Data for Simulations}\label{weather-data-for-simulations}

Weather data can be used for various purposes by simulation program such as EnergyPlus. For some purposes, such as validating a model to actual energy use, you may wish to match the weather data to the simulation period. However, for most purposes, you will wish to have a more typical weather data profile. Information on selecting weather data is described in this paper:
