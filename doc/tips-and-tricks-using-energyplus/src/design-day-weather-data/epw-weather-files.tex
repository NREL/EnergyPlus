\section{EPW Weather Files}\label{epw-weather-files}

The WeatherConverter converts from other source formats to EPW and EnergyPlus CSV formats. The WeatherConverter also produces a statistics file that provides a quick synopsis of the converted data and is used by the tabular reports (ref: Climatic Data Summary report). For Ecotect users, the Weather Converter can also save as .wea format. We do not support conversion of EPWs to other formats, including to TMY2. The Weather Converter is described in detail in the \href{AuxiliaryPrograms.pdf}{Auxiliary Programs document}.
