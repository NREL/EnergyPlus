\section{DataSets}\label{datasets}

Akin to the libraries of other programs, EnergyPlus uses data sets.~ Data sets are similar to libraries but many items are contained in a single file (usually input file format or sometimes macro format).~ Developers are encouraged, as appropriate, to submit data sets along with new features.~ Some of the existing data sets include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Materials properties
\item
  Construction elements (layers of materials)
\item
  Composite construction definitions (equivalent constructions for complex elements)
\item
  Solar Collector parameters
\item
  Economic Tariffs
\item
  Design Day definitions
\item
  Location definitions
\item
  Standard report definitions
\end{itemize}
