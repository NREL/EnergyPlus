\section{Summary of Predictor-Corrector Procedure}\label{summary-of-predictor-corrector-procedure}

The predictor-corrector scheme can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using Equation~\ref{eq:SteadyStateSystemOutput}, an estimate is made of the air system energy required to balance the equation with the zone air temperature equal to the setpoint temperature.
\item
  With that quantity as a demand, the air system is simulated to determine its actual supply capability at the time of the simulation. This will include a plant simulation if necessary.
\item
  The actual air system capability is used in Equation~\ref{eq:ZoneTemperatureUpdateEquation} to calculate the resulting zone temperature.
\end{itemize}
