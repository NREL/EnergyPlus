\section{Document Overview}\label{document-overview}

This document is organized to give you the best possible look into the EnergyPlus calculations. First, the concepts of modeling in EnergyPlus are presented. These include descriptions of the zone heat balance process, air loop/plant loop processes as well as other important processes for the building simulation.

Discussions during the modeling process may reference specific ``object names'' as found in the Input/Output Reference document.

The remainder of the document focuses on individual models.
