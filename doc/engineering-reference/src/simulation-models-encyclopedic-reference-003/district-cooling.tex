\section{District Cooling }\label{district-cooling}

When the user is not interested in a plant simulation or there is some centralized source of chilled water, the following model can be used in the input.~ This allows the user to achieve a simulation without specifying operating parameters or curve fits for chiller models.~ This model only needs the connections to the loop and the nominal capacity to simulate.~ See the InputOutput Reference for additional information (Object: DistrictCooling).~ This model calculates the output capacity necessary from the inlet temperature to the setpoint temperature for that loop with the given mass flow rate in Watts.
