\section{Convection from Surfaces}\label{convection-from-surfaces}

This contribution is expressed using the convective heat transfer coefficient as follows:

\begin{equation}
{q_{conv}} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{nsurfaces} {{h_{c,i}}{A_i}\left( {{T_a} - {T_{s,i}}} \right)}
\end{equation}

The inside heat transfer coefficient is modeled from a choice of correlations.
