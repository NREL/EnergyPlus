\section{Convection from Internal Sources}\label{convection-from-internal-sources}

This component is the companion part of the radiant contribution from internal gains described previously.~ It is added directly into the air heat balance. Such a treatment also violates the tenets of the heat balance since the surface temperature of the surfaces producing the internal loads exchange heat with the zone air through normal convective processes.~~ However, once again, the details required to include this component in the heat balance are generally not available, and its direct inclusion into the air heat balance is a reasonable approach.
