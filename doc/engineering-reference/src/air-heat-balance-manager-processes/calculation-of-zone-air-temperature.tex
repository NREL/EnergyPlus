\section{Calculation of Zone Air Temperature}\label{calculation-of-zone-air-temperature}

The zone air heat balance is the primary mechanism for linking the loads calculation to the system simulation.~ As such, the zone air temperature becomes the main interface variable.~ Its role in the integration process was described previously (``Basis for the Zone and Air System Integration'').
