  ! Basic file description:  Basic test for EnergyPlus.  Resistive Walls.  Regular (no ground contact) floor.
  !                          Regular roof.  No Windows.
  !
  ! Highlights:              Very basic test to see that EnergyPlus "works".
  !
  !
  ! Simulation Location/Run: DENVER_STAPLETON_CO_USA_WMO_724690, 2 design days, 1 run period,
  !                          Run Control executes two design days (see RUN PERIOD object)
  !
  ! Location:                Denver, CO
  !
  ! Design Days:             DENVER_STAPLETON_CO_USA Annual Heating 99%, MaxDB = -16degC
  !                          DENVER_STAPLETON_CO_USA Annual Cooling (DB = >MWB) 1%, MaxDB = 32.6degC MWB = 15.5degC
  !
  ! Run Period (Weather File): Full Annual Simulation, DENVER_STAPLETON_CO_USA_WMO_724690
  !
  ! Run Control:             No zone or system sizing, design day run control (no weather file simulation)
  !
  ! Building: Fictional 1 zone building with resistive walls.
  !
  !           The building is oriented due north.
  !
