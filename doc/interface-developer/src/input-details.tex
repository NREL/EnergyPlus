\chapter{Input Details}\label{input-details}

This document does not cover the input ``classes'' in detail.~ For details on each class and examples of both input and output resulting from that class/object, please view the \href{file:///E:/Docs4PDFs/InputOutputReference.pdf}{Input Output Reference} document.~ In this document, we will show the ``conventions'' used in the IDD and provide limited examples for illustration purposes. Even the list of objects is dynamic, so we give you a method to see them from the IDFEditor.

An intelligent editor (IDFEditor) has been written and can be used as an illustration of how the comments in the IDD might be used by Interface Developers to guide their developments.~ IDFEditor is described in the \href{file:///E:/Docs4PDFs/GettingStarted.pdf}{Getting Started} document.

A full example of a very simple IDF is included in Appendix A to this document.
