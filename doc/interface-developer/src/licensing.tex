In order to make efficient distribution of your interface, you should consider licensing EnergyPlus.~ First, you must license/register to use EnergyPlus.~ Since we are distributing EnergyPlus via the World Wide Web, at no charge, it will be easy to get your hands on a copy for testing out your interface.~ However, you may wish to understand more of the internals and, to make a complete distribution package, will need to at least execute a distribution license.
