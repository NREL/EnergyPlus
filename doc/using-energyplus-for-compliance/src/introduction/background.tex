Energy Standards abound throughout the world. This document provides guidance on using EnergyPlus and its reports for compliance with energy standards.

The tabular reports from EnergyPlus were designed to help collate information into a form usually required for reporting on designs for energy use. The tabular reports are fully described in the Output Details document and will be judiciously reproduced here for clarity and reference. In addition, by using the Output:Table:Style object, one can obtain the reports in a variety of formats -- ready for incorporating into your own style for submission or presentation.

First, we describe the features available in the tabular report that might be used for energy compliance reporting or presentation of energy designs to clients.
