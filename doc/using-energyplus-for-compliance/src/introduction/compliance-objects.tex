\section{Compliance Objects}\label{compliance-objects}

To facilitate using EnergyPlus for compliance reporting, a group of Compliance Objects is described in the Input Output Reference document. Currently, there is only one object in this group: \textbf{Compliance:Building} which, when fully populated, will describe various aspects that are needed specific to buildings. Other compliance objects will be added to this group when appropriate.
