\section{Features Related to California Title 24 Compliance}\label{features-related-to-california-title-24-compliance}

EnergyPlus has a reporting feature that is useful for obtaining Time Dependant Valuation (TDV) of source energy use for the entire facility being simulated. Hourly variations of fuel factors can be specified through the `FuelFactors' input object and will be used to calculate TDV based source energy consumption broken down by end uses. The Source Energy End Use Components Summary report above provides these TDV based values. The source energy consumption is also reported based on area normalized metrics. Refer to `Fuel Factors' and `Output:Table:SummaryReports' in the Input-Output Reference manual for more details.

Also included is the California\_Title\_24-2008.idf dataset (described briefly in the Output Details document).
