\section{Features Related to Appendix G and LEED}\label{features-related-to-appendix-g-and-leed}

EnergyPlus has several built-in features to make demonstrating compliance with ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G easier. Appendix G is used in Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1 Optimize Energy Performance of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) building certification system called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System™. The following sections describe the features.

The \textbf{Tips and Tricks for Using EnergyPlus} also contains valuable information such as how to model the temperature resets that Appendix G mandates (see section Use of Set Point Managers).

\subsection{Baseline Building Rotations}\label{baseline-building-rotations}

Table G3.1 Section 5 Building Envelope of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G requires that the baseline building be simulated facing four directions:

Orientation. The baseline building performance shall be generated by simulating the building with its actual orientation and again after rotating the entire building 90, 180, and 270 degrees, then averaging the results.

This provision intends to provide a baseline that is neutral to building orientation so that buildings purposely oriented to minimize energy use can realize a percent savings.

\textbf{Step 1.} The first step of performing the building rotations is to include a Compliance:Building object which contains the Building Rotation for Appendix G field. The value of the field should be different for four simulations, 0, 90, 180 and 270 (see Step 2 below). This is further documented in the Input Output Reference.

\begin{lstlisting}

Compliance:Building,
      90;                 Building Rotation for Appendix G
\end{lstlisting}

Also make sure that the HTML summary reports will be generated by including the following:

\begin{lstlisting}

OutputControl:Table:Style,
    HTML;                      !- type

  Output:Table:SummaryReports,
    AllSummary;                !- type
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Step 2.} The ParametricPreprocessor automates the creation of the four simulation input files so that only a single simulation file is needs to be created by the user. By setting the file name suffixes (which are appended to the existing file name for each simulation), setting a variable that varies for the four simulations, and setting the Building Rotation for Appendix G to this variable, the user can automatically create the four files when using EnergyPlus. The following example shows what should be included in the EnergyPlus file. The Parametric objects are described further in the Input Output Reference and the ParametricPreprocessor is described in the Auxiliary Programs documentation.

\begin{lstlisting}
Parametric:FileNameSuffix,
  Names,
  G000,
  G090,
  G180,
  G270;
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
Parametric:SetValueForRun,
  $appGAngle,            !- Parameter Name
  0.0,                   !- Value 1
  90.0,                  !- Value 2
  180.0,                 !- Value 3
  270.0;                 !- Value 4
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
Compliance:Building,
    = $appGAngle;        !- Building Rotation for Appendix G {deg}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
OutputControl:Table:Style,
  HTML;                      !- type
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Table:SummaryReports,
  AllSummary;                !- type
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Step 3.} Run the simulation using EP-Launch. Using the ``Single Input File'' tab of EP-Launch select the input that contains the Compliance:Building, Parametric:FileNameSuffix, Parametric:SetValueForRun objects as shown above in Step 2 as well as the weather file. In EP-Launch, make sure under VIEW .. OPTIONS .. MISCELLANEOUS that the RUN PARAMETRICPREPROCESSOR option is checked.

\textbf{Step 4}. Review the results and revise the model inputs as needed. You can view the results of the simulation by using the EP-Launch and the History tab. At the bottom of the history list, four simulations that use the G000, G090, G180 and G270 file name suffixes should appear and the result files associated with each can be selected and opened.

\textbf{Step 5.} Use the AppGPostProcess to average results across the simulations. In EP-Launch under the UTILITIES tab, select AppGPostProcess utility and select one of the HTML files resulting from the multiple simulation runs (e.g., \textless{}filename\textgreater{}-G000.html). This will open all four files and generate a new output file with the file suffix GAVG for the HTML and other results files that can be opened on that tab.

\subsection{Completing LEED Forms from Tabular Reports}\label{completing-leed-forms-from-tabular-reports}

The U.S. Green Building Council building certification system called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System™ includes Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1 Optimize Energy Performance. Credit 1 includes an option that requires a series of building energy simulations that follow the procedures of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G Performance Rating Method. The~ LEED Summary report provides many of the simulation results required for the forms. The report can be produced by specifying LEEDSummary in Output:Table:SummaryReports which is also part of the AllSummary option. 

The EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance subtable show an energy breakdown by all end-use categories and subcategories. The end-use subcategories that are supplied on many objects are used to populate the rows of this table. Any text can be used for the end-use subcategories and no special meaning is attached to any specific text. You may want to consider using end-use subcategories with names like ``Cooking" which would be most commonly used with the ElectricEquipment and GasEquipment objects, ``Elevators and Escalators" most commonly with the ElectricEquipment object, ``Industrial Process" most commonly with the ElectricEquipment and GasEquipment objects, ``Interior Lighting-Process" most commonly with the Lights object, or ``Fans-Parking Garage" most commonly with the Exterior:FuelEquipment object. These end-use subcategories as well as any others used are shown in the EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance subtable.
