\subsection{CodeCompliantEquipment.idf}\label{codecompliantequipment.idf}

This dataset includes performance curve objects that describe the part load performance of building energy code minimally compliant equipment. The dataset provides curves for the following EnergyPlus objects: Chiller:Electric:EIR. Sets of curves are provided for the following building energy codes minimum requirements: ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2019 Table 6.8.1-3, ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2019 Table G3.5.3.

Generating performances curves meeting both full and part load efficiency numbers require solving a largely underdetermined system of equations. The number of unknowns depend on the type of curves, which mostly depend on the algorithm used by the software and used in models. It also means that an infinite number of solutions exists. One way to solve this issue is to turn it into a constrained problem and use a simple genetic algorithm (GA) with a well-defined objective or cost function to determine potential solutions with physical significance. A GA can have a short computational time, be scalable, versatile, find solutions to problems with large number of parameters to problems with multiple local optima so it is a good candidate for this task. The algorithm used to generate the curves in this dataset starts with a ``seed'' set of curves that can be user-modifiable, target full load, and part load efficiency as inputs.

Among others, a ``nearest neighbor'' type method was developed to aggregate sets of curves and generate a generic set of curves for a specific target to be used as ``seed'' set of curves to the aforementioned algorithm. This method selects the N sets of performance curves that best match the targeted equipment characteristics in terms of capacity, full load efficiency, part load efficiency, and other applicable characteristics. Each selected sets of curves are scored based on how close it is to the targeted equipment characteristics. A wide mesh of values for each input variable(s) to each curve is then created and corresponding output calculated. The outputs are then weighted average based on their previously determined score. A regression and normalization at rated conditions is then performed to obtain the aggregated curves.

\subsection{CompositeWallConstructions.idf}\label{compositewallconstructions.idf}

The Reference Data Set CompositeWallConstructions.idf contains constructions and associated materials for a set of \textbf{composite} walls. These are walls---such as stud walls---that have complicated heat-flow paths so that the conduction is two- or three-dimensional.

An example entry in this data set--for an insulated 2''x4'' steel-stud wall--looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}

The materials here are \textbf{not} real materials but are ``equivalent'' materials obtained from finite-difference modeling. The thickness, conductivity, density and specific heat values of the material layers for the different constructions have been taken from the ASHRAE report ``Modeling Two- and Three-Dimensional Heat Transfer through Composite Wall and Roof Assemblies in Hourly Energy Simulation Programs (1145-TRP),'' by Enermodal Engineering Limited, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Polish Academy of Sciences, January 2001. EnergyPlus will calculate conduction transfer functions using these materials. The heat transfer based on these conduction transfer functions will then be very close to what would be calculated with a two- or three-dimensional heat transfer calculation.

For stud walls, using these composite constructions will give more accurate heat flow than you would get by manually dividing the wall into a stud section and a non-stud section.

If your wall's exterior or interior roughness or thermal, solar or visible absorptances are different from those in the data set, you can make the appropriate changes to the first material (the outside layer) or the third material (the inside layer). \textbf{None of the other values should be changed.}

\subsection{ElectronicEnthalpyEconomizerCurves.idf}\label{electronicenthalpyeconomizercurves.idf}

These curves approximate the electronic (variable) enthalpy curves used to simulate humidity biased economizer control. This control scheme adjusts the upper outdoor air humidity ratio based on outdoor air dry-bulb temperature as shown in the figure below. California Title 24 ACM 2005 lists the optional economizer control strategies. One of these control strategies is referred to as variable enthalpy control curve A. This control strategy is also cited in ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004, using the term ``electronic enthalpy''. Electronic enthalpy curves A-D are included in this dataset.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 12
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image027.jpg}
\caption{Psychrometric Chart Illustration of the Electronic (Variable) Enthalpy Economizer Limit Example Curve Objects \protect \label{fig:psychrometric-chart-illustration-of}}
\end{figure}

For the curves provided, curve A has the highest limit and curve D has the lowest limit. These curve objects represent a single-point electronic enthalpy control curve with the curve object's minimum value of x (temperature) crossing the psychrometric chart's saturation line and the curve object's maximum value of x crossing the psychrometric chart's dry-bulb temperature axis. The curve object's minimum (maximum) value of x should be just low (high) enough to ensure that the curve crosses the psychrometric chart's saturation line (temperature axis). The curves are evaluated at an outdoor dry-bulb temperature to provide a maximum operating outdoor humidity ratio for economizer operation. If the outdoor humidity ratio is greater than this maximum value, economizer operation is terminated. These curves may be used with other economizer limits to create multi-point economizer control (Temperature Limit, Temperature Low Limit, Enthalpy Limit, and Dewpoint Temperature Limit).

\subsubsection{Form of the Electronic Enthalpy Curve Equation:}\label{form-of-the-electronic-enthalpy-curve-equation}

The electronic enthalpy curve equation represents a unique curve and is a function of both temperature and relative humidity. The equation is set equal to a constant which provides a unique temperature for each relative humidity entered into the equation. Each control curve has a unique constant as shown in the table below. Other constants may be used to develop specialized electronic enthalpy curves.

\begin{equation}
K = 45.672192 - 1.1559942 \cdot T - 0.144599 \cdot RH
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  K~ = Constant value to represent specific curve
\item
  T~ = Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature (C)
\item
  RH = Outdoor Relative Humidity (\%)
\end{itemize}

NOTE:~ modifying the RH multiplier (-0.144599) tends to ``wag'' the curvature at the upper relative humidities. Decreasing the multiplier ``wags'' the upper portion of the curve downward, increasing ``wags'' it upwards. Modifying the constant (K) moves the intersection of the curve with the Dry-Bulb Temperature ~axis. Increasing the constant moves the intersection to the left as shown in the figure, decreasing moves to the right. The minimum and/or maximum x boundaries in the curve objects may have to be adjusted when modifying the equation.

\subsubsection{Example Curve A:}\label{example-curve-a}

The method described here was used to create each of the four ``cubic'' curve objects provided in the electronic enthalpy economizer control data set.

\textbf{Step 1:} Substitute the curve constant K for curve A (12) into the electronic enthalpy curve equation and solve for temperature. Then identify the outdoor air dry-bulb temperatures at known values of relative humidity (e.g., columns 1 and 2 in the table below). Psychrometric routines are helpful for this step.

\begin{equation}
\text{Temperature} = \frac{12 - 45.672192 + 0.144599 \cdot \text{RelativeHumidity}}{-1.1559942}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Step 2:} Identify humidity ratio at each point (e.g.~column 3 in the following table). Psychrometric routines are helpful for this step.

\begin{longtable}[c]{p{1.78in}p{1.5in}p{2.71in}}

100 & 16.620 & 0.01189 \tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{~}

\textbf{Step 3:} Use multiple linear regression to solve one of the following equations:

\emph{Quadratic~ Curve}: Humidity Ratio = A0 + A1*Temperature + A2*Temperature\(^{2}\)

\emph{Cubic~ Curve}: Humidity Ratio = A0 + A1*Temperature + A2*Temperature\(^{2}\) + A3*Temperature\(^{3}\)

\textbf{Step 4:} Use the coefficients calculated in the multiple linear regression to create a cubic (or quadratic) curve object.

\subsection{GHLERefData.idf}\label{ghlerefdata.idf}

This file contains sample input for the ground loop heat exchanger model. The response of the borehole/ground is found from the `G-function' that is~ defined in the input as series of `n' pairs of values (LNTTSn, GNFCn). It is important to note that the G-functions have to be calculated for specific GHE configurations and borehole resitance, length and borehole/ length ratio. That is, the parameters for the units vary with each design. The data in this file are intended as examples/samples and may not represent actual designs.

The sample data has been calculated for a number of configurations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1 x 2 boreholes
\item
  4 x 4 boreholes
\item
  8 x 8 boreholes
\end{itemize}

Data is given for both `standard' grout (k = 0.744 W/m.K) and `thermally enhanced' grout (k = 1.471 W/m.K). The flow rate per borehole is .1514 kg/s. The pipe given is 0.75in. Dia. SDR11 HDPE. The fluid is water. The borehole/length ratio is 0.06~ (76.2m/4.572m {[}300ft/15ft{]})

\subsection{MoistureMaterials.idf}\label{moisturematerials.idf}

\subsection{PerfCurves.idf}\label{perfcurves.idf}

This file contains performance curves for various EnergyPlus equipment objects.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Variable speed DX cooling:~ These curves are appropriate for small DX cooling units with variable speed compressors. These curves would be referenced by the EnergyPlus object Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed. See the example input file 5ZoneAutoDXVAV for an example of their use.
\item
  Variable Speed Cooling Tower: These model coefficient objects are appropriate for use with the variable speed cooling tower object and represent the coefficients used in the YorkCalc and CoolTools empirical models. These model coefficient objects would be referenced by the EnergyPlus object Cooling Tower:Variable Speed. See the example input file CoolingTower\_VariableSpeed.idf for an example of where these curves could be used (these model coefficient objects are not specifically used in this idf but could be used by the Cooling Tower:Variable Speed object). Additional information on variable speed cooling tower model coefficients can be found in the Input Output Reference and Engineering Reference documents.
\item
  Note that performance curves for the Electric EIR chiller and the Electric Reformulated EIR chiller are contained in the Chillers.idf dataset.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PrecipitationSchedulesUSA.idf}\label{precipitationschedulesusa.idf}

This file contains schedules (for an entire year) of precipitation for use with the SitePrecipitation object. Use these schedules for adding rain water to the simulation. The values are in meters per hour and are scaled to match the average monthly precipitation. They also coincide with the EPW rain/snow flags from the original source files.

\subsection{RefrigerationCasesDataSet.idf}\label{refrigerationcasesdataset.idf}

All the refrigerated cases included in this database are listed in the following list. Comments before each refrigeration:case object include the manufacturer's model number and assumptions about the fan, lights, defrost etc. The user must ensure that the case names used in the idf file are UNIQUE and must supply the correct zone name.~ The user must also supply any required correction curves or schedules. The defrost and drip-down schedule names included here indicate the frequency and duration required. The user must ensure that schedules are provided that meet these needs and that are diversified so that all the cases don't start their defrost cycles at the same time. Please see the example cases for supermarkets to see how these case objects are included with the rest of a supermarket refrigeration system.
