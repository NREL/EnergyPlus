\section{eplusout.rdd}

This file (from the \textbf{Output:VariableDictionary,regular;} and \textbf{Output:VariableDictionary,IDF;} commands) shows all the report variables along with their “availability” for the current input file. Each simulation \emph{may have} different output variables though some are constant (for example the environmental/outdoor variables! A user must first run the simulation (at least semi-successfully) before the available output variables are known. This output file is available in two flavors: regular (listed as they are in the Input Output Reference) and IDF (ready to be copied and pasted into your Input File). Once this file is generated, the IDF editor can use them for Output:Variable keys. You can also ask for the outputs to be sorted by name.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:VariableDictionary,regular,Name;
\end{lstlisting}

``\textbf{Zone}'' variables are calculated and can be reported after each Zone/Heat Balance timestep (ref: TimeSteps in Hour command). ``\textbf{HVAC}'' variables are calculated and can be reported with each variable HVAC timestep. ``Average'' variables will be averaged over the time interval being reported whereas ``sum'' variables are summed over that time interval.

There are two mitigating factors for this output variable list. One is the “Advanced Report Variables” and the other is the “Create Minimal Surface Variables”.

\subsection{Normal Output Variables – regular format}

\subsection{Normal Output Variables – IDF format}

A brief excerpt of the IDF format is shown below. These can be copied and pasted directly into an IDF or used from the IDF Editor.

\begin{lstlisting}

\subsection{Advanced Output Variables}

The DisplayAdvancedReportVariables key to the Output:Diagnostics object adds a number of variables that may need special handling or understanding of the users. Search on the Input Output Reference document for DisplayAdvancedReportVariables for more details.
