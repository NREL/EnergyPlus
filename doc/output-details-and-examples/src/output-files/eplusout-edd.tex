This file is invoked by including an Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object. The EDD file contains three different types of information related to the Energy Management System (EMS) including: (1) listing of available actuators, (2) listing of available internal variables, and (3) a record of the execution of user's programs for the EnergyPlus Runtime Language (Erl).

The EMS feature in EnergyPlus uses ``Actuators'' to do control operations. The actuators available in a given model depend on the non-EMS-related content of the input file. Similar to how EnergyPlus reports the available output variables to the RDD file, a list of available actuators can be written to the EDD file. There are three settings in the Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object that control how actuators are listed. Selecting ``None'' directs the program to not list the available actuators. Selecting ``NotByUniqueKeyNames'' directs the program to provide a concise listing of the available actuators that does not include their enumeration by unique name. Selecting ``Verbose'' directs the program to provide a complete listing of the available actuators including the unique identifying names. An example listing of actuators using the~ ``NotByUniqueKeyNames''~ option follows.

The EMS feature in EnergyPlus uses ``Internal Variables'' to obtain input data for use in scaling the results of control calculations. The internal variables available in a give model depend on the non-EMS-related content of the input file. Similar to how EnergyPlus reports the available output variables to the RDD file, a list of available internal variables can be written to the EDD file. There are three settings in the Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object that control how internal variables are listed. Selecting ``None'' directs the program to not list the available internal variables. Selecting ``NotByUniqueKeyNames'' directs the program to provide a concise listing of the available internal variables that does not include their enumeration by unique name. Selecting ``Verbose'' directs the program to provide a complete listing of the available internal variables including the unique identifying names. An example listing of actuators using the~ ``NotByUniqueKeyNames''~ option follows.

The EMS uses the EnergyPlus Runtime Language, or Erl, to do custom controlling. When Erl programs are being developed, the EDD becomes a primary source of information for debugging. When a line of Erl code is executed, the program can output records called ``line traces'' that are useful for debugging because they show the outcome of each line of code. There are three settings in the Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object that control how line traces are reported. Selecting ``None'' directs the program to not write out any line traces. Selecting ``ErrorsOnly'' directs the program to only write line traces when computation errors are encountered (such as divide by zero). Selecting ``Verbose'' directs the program to write out line traces for each and every line of Erl program code that is executed.

It is very important to be careful with the EDD file. The Verbose option should be used with care because a full line-by-line trace of Erl program execution for an annual run can easily create an enormous computer file that is too large for most computer systems. ~It is possible for EnergyPlus to generate an EDD file that cannot be opened in traditional text editors.
