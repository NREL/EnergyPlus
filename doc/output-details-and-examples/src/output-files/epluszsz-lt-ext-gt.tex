\section{epluszsz.\textless{}ext\textgreater{}}\label{epluszsz.ext}

This file is a result of the zone sizing calculation. Zone Sizing (see Sizing:Zone object) performs a special calculation, using a theoretical ideal zonal system, and determines the zone design heating and cooling flow rates and loads, saving the results in the zone sizing arrays. The file has a similar format to the eplusssz.\textless{}ext\textgreater{} file.

The columns are:

\subsubsection{Field: Time}\label{field-time-000}

Calculation time -- this will show the time steps used by the simulation and by the sizing calculation.

\subsubsection{Sizing Calculation Fields}\label{sizing-calculation-fields}

Each of the Zone Sizing output fields has the Zone Name, the Environment Name for the peak prepended to the item that has been calculated.~ The four fields calculated are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Des Heat Load
\item
  Des Sens Cool Load
\item
  Des Heat Mass Flow
\item
  Des Cool Mass Flow
\end{itemize}

These are repeated for the number of zones in the sizing calculation.

\subsubsection{Field:~ Des Heat Load {[}W{]}}\label{field-des-heat-load-w}

This is the calculated design/required heating load at the time step.

\subsubsection{Field:~ Des Sens Cool Load {[}W{]}}\label{field-des-sens-cool-load-w}

This is the calculated design/required cooling load at the time step.

\subsubsection{Field:~ Des Heat Mass Flow {[}kg/s{]}}\label{field-des-heat-mass-flow-kgs-000}

This is the calculated design/required heating mass flow rate at the time step.

\subsubsection{Field: Des Cool Mass Flow {[}kg/s{]}}\label{field-des-cool-mass-flow-kgs-000}

This is the calculated design/required cooling mass flow rate at the time step.

\subsubsection{Line: Peak}\label{line-peak}

This indicates the peak calculation (load or mass flow) over the 24 hour condensed sizing period.

\subsubsection{Line: Peak Vol Flow {[}m3/s{]}}\label{line-peak-vol-flow-m3s}

For the mass flow rates, this indicates the peak volume flow calculation (m3/s) over the 24 hour condensed sizing period.
