\section{eplusout.eio}\label{eplusout.eio}

This file contains some standard and some optional ``reports''. It is intended to be a somewhat intelligent report of input conditions when they don't fit well in other places or when they aren't substantial enough for their own ``file''. (e.g. \textbf{eplusout.bnd})~ Contents of the file are somewhat documented in various places in the \textbf{Input Output Reference document} -- as results of objects. This file or portions of it can be easily imported into spreadsheet programs and more analysis done there. Contents of this file include construction details, location information, site water mains temperature information, ``environment'' information, number of ``warmup'' days required in each environment.

The form of the file is a data dictionary line followed by the data. In this case, the data dictionary line precedes the first ``data'' line though there may be several defining ``dictionary lines''. Each dictionary line will show the field as \textless{}field name\textgreater{} followed by other fields that will be in the data lines. Data will be displayed similarly. Each field of dictionary or data will be separated from the next by a comma ``,'' -- and produce a comma delimited file. However, the lines for data will not be contiguous -- some follow a stream of consciousness of the EnergyPlus execution.

This section is subdivided into grouped sections by type.

Note that the lines in the eplusout.eio file can be extremely long (current limit is 500 characters).

The simulation parameters output is the simplest form of reporting in the \textbf{eplusout.eio} file. Each of the ``header'' records (lines starting with an ``!'') are followed immediately by the one and only data line. By and large, these data lines are all merely echoes of the entries in the IDF (or defaulted for blank fields). For most of these descriptions, you can look at the object fields (of same name) in the \href{file:///E:/Docs4PDFs/InputOutputReference.pdf}{Input Output Reference} document.

\subsection{Version}\label{version}

! \textless{}Version\textgreater{}, Version ID

~Version, \textless{}version\textgreater{}

This is the version of the IDF as entered in the IDF file. If it does not match the current EnergyPlus Version, a warning will be issued and show in the \textbf{eplusout.err} file.

\subsection{Timestep}\label{timestep}

! \textless{}Timesteps per Hour\textgreater{}, \#TimeSteps, Minutes per TimeStep

~Timesteps Per Hour,~ 4, 15

This is the number of timesteps in hour as entered in the IDF file as well as showing how many minutes will encompass each timestep (i.e.~4 timesteps in hour = 15 minutes per timestep).

\subsection{SimulationControl}\label{simulationcontrol}

! \textless{}Run Control\textgreater{}, Do Zone Sizing, Do System Sizing, Do Plant Sizing, Do Design Days, Do Weather Simulation, Do HVAC Sizing Simulation

~Run Control, Yes, Yes, Yes, No, Yes, No

This shows how the sizing and running (design days vs.~weather file) will be accomplished. Design days are required for sizing but do not necessarily need to be ``run'' after sizing has completed. Thus, the user can choose to do sizing, not do a ``normal'' calculation with the design day definitions but then go ahead and run the full simulation year. Some advanced sizing methods require also running HVAC Sizing Simulations.

\subsection{Building}\label{building}

! \textless{}Building Information\textgreater{}, Building Name,North Axis \{deg\},Terrain,~ Loads Convergence Tolerance Value,Temperature Convergence Tolerance Value,~ Solar Distribution,Maximum Number of Warmup Days

~Building Information, BUILDING,~ 30.000,City,~~ 0.04000,~~ 0.40000,FullExterior,25

This shows the values put in for the Building Object in the IDF.

\subsection{Inside Convection Algorithm}\label{inside-convection-algorithm}

\subsection{Solution Algorithm}\label{solution-algorithm}

! \textless{}Solution Algorithm\textgreater{}, Value \{CTF \textbar{} EMPD \textbar{} CONDFD \textbar{} HAMT\},Inside Surface Max Temperature Limit\{C\}

Solution Algorithm, CTF,200

This shows the solution algorithm approach selected by the IDF value and Inside Surface Max Temperature override or default value.

\subsection{Sky Radiance Distribution}\label{sky-radiance-distribution}

! \textless{}Sky Radiance Distribution\textgreater{}, Value \{Anisotropic\}

Sky Radiance Distribution,Anisotropic

This shows the solution algorithm approach used in the simulation. As this value cannot be changed by the user, it is shown for information only.

\subsection{Site Atmospheric Variation}\label{site-atmospheric-variation}

! \textless{}Environment:Site Atmospheric Variation\textgreater{},Wind Speed Profile Exponent \{\},Wind Speed Profile Boundary Layer Thickness \{m\},Air Temperature Gradient Coefficient \{K/m\}

Environment:Site Atmospheric Variation,0.330,460.000,6.500000E-003

This shows actual values used for Site Atmospheric Variations.

\subsection{Shadowing/Sun Position Calculations}\label{shadowingsun-position-calculations}

! \textless{}Shadowing/Sun Position Calculations\textgreater{} {[}Annual Simulations{]}, Calculation Method, Value \{days\}, Allowable Number Figures in Shadow Overlap \{\}, Polygon Clipping Algorithm, Sky Diffuse Modeling Algorithm

Shadowing/Sun Position Calculations, AverageOverDaysInFrequency, 20, 15000, SutherlandHodgman, SimpleSkyDiffuseModeling

This shows how many days between the re-calculation of solar position during a weather file simulation. While a smaller number of days will lead to a more accurate solar position estimation (solar position is important in shadowing as well as determining how much solar enters the space), it also increases the calculation time necessarily to complete the simulation. The default, re-calculating every 20 days, gives a good compromise. The allowable number of figures in a shadow overlap can be increased if necessary for the model. There are two calculation methods available: AverageOverDaysInFrequency (default) and DetailedTimestepIntegration.

\subsection{AirflowNetwork Model:Control}\label{airflownetwork-modelcontrol}

\subsubsection{Field: Wind Speed Modifier Coefficient {[}Internal{]}}\label{field-wind-speed-modifier-coefficient-internal}

This field is intended to provide a slight help for the user to determine the calculations that will be used to calculate the Wind Speed at a specific height at the site.

The full calculation for Local Wind Speed is:

\begin{equation}
\text{LocalWindSpeed} = \text{WindSpeed}_{met} \left( \frac{\text{WindBoundaryLayerThickness}_{met}}{\text{AirSensorHeight}_{met}} \right)^{\text{WindExponent}_{met}} \left(\frac{\text{HeightAboveGround}_{site/component}}{\text{WindBoundaryLayerThickness}_{site}}\right)^{\text{SiteWindExponent}}
\end{equation}

The Wind Speed Modifier Coefficient {[}Internal{]} simplifies the equation to:

\begin{equation}
\text{LocalWindSpeed} = \text{WindSpeed}_{met} \left( \text{WindSpeedModifier} \right) \left(\frac{\text{HeightAboveGround}_{site/component}}{\text{WindBoundaryLayerThickness}_{site}}\right)^{\text{SiteWindExponent}}
\end{equation}

Where the Wind Speed Modifier encapsulates:

\begin{equation}
\text{WindSpeedModifier} = \left( \frac{\text{WindBoundaryLayerThickness}_{met}}{\text{AirSensorHeight}_{met}} \right)^{\text{WindExponent}_{met}}
\end{equation}

Where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  met = meteorological station
\item
  site = location of the building
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Field:Temperature Modifier Coefficient {[}Internal{]}}\label{fieldtemperature-modifier-coefficient-internal}

This field is intended to provide a slight help for the user to determine the calculations that will be used to calculate the air (dry-bulb) or wet-bulb temperature at a specific height at the site.

The site temperature modifier coefficient (TMC) is defined as:

\begin{equation}
TMC = frac{ \text{AtmosphericTemperatureGradient} \cdot \text{EarthRadius} \cdot \text{TemperatureSensorHeight}_{met} }
                  { \text{EarthRadius} + \text{TemperatureSensorHeight}_{met} }
\end{equation}

Then, the temperature at a height above ground is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{ActualTemperature} = \text{Temperature}_{met} + TMC -
    frac{ \text{TemperatureGradient}_{site} * \text{EarthRadius} * \text{Height}_{site/component} }
        { \text{EarthRadius} + \text{Height}_{site/component} }
\end{equation}

Where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  met = meteorological station
\item
  site = location of the building
\end{itemize}

This is the multiplier (must be integral) entered from the IDF.

\subsubsection{Field: Ceiling Height \{m\}}\label{field-ceiling-height-m}

This is the ceiling height entered, if any, in the IDF. Ceiling height is also heuristically calculated from the surfaces in the zone -- however, not all surfaces need to be entered and sometimes the user would rather enter the ceiling height for the zone. If no ceiling height was entered (i.e.~the default of 0), this field will be the calculated value. A minor warning message will be issued if the calculated value is significantly different than the entered value. Units are m.

\subsubsection{Field: Volume \{m3\}}\label{field-volume-m3}

Like the ceiling height, this user can also enter this value in the IDF. Volume is also heuristically calculated using the ceiling height (entered or calculated) as well as the calculated floor area (see later field). If entered here, this value will be used rather than the calculated value. A minor warning message will be issued if the calculated value is significantly different than the entered value. Units are m\(^{3}\).

\subsubsection{Field: Part of Total Building Area}\label{field-part-of-total-building-area}

This field displays ``Yes'' when the zone is to be considered part of the total building floor area or ``No'' when it's not to be considered. This consideration has no impact on simulation but on reporting. Namely, when the value is ``no'', the zone is not part of the Total Floor Area as shown in the Annual Building Utility Performance Summary tables. In addition, when ``No'' is specified, the area is excluded from both the conditioned floor area and the total floor area in the Building Area sub table and the Normalized Metrics sub tables.

\subsubsection{Field: Nominal U (w/o film coefs)}\label{field-nominal-u-wo-film-coefs}

A nominal thermal conductance for the surface is calculated for the surface. It does not include interior or exterior film coefficients as this is calculated during the simulation and is dependent on several factors that may change during the simulation time period. Units for this field are W/m\(^{2}\)-K.

For windows, no value is reported because the film coefficients cannot be removed from the U-value.

\subsubsection{Field: Nominal U (with film coefs)}\label{field-nominal-u-with-film-coefs}

A nominal thermal conductance for the surface is calculated for the surface, including film coefficients. Units for this field are W/m\(^{2}\)-K.

For opaque surfaces, interior and exterior film coefficients are added to the surface construction based on the prescribed R-values for interior and exterior film coefficients as found in ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix A, and shown below:~ The SI values are the exact values used inside EnergyPlus.

NOTE:~ The resulting ``Nominal U with film coefs'' is only for comparison purposes with the ASHRAE 90.1 requirements. Actual film coefficients are calculated during the simulation and are dependent on several factors that may change during the simulation time period.

For windows, the ``Nominal U with film coefs'' is calculated using the following assumptions from the WINDOW 5 program (also NFRC winter conditions):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Indoor air temperature = 21 C (69.8 F)
\item
  Outdoor air temperature = -18 C (-.4 F)
\item
  Exterior film coefficient = ~ 26 W/m\(^{2}\) (4.58 ft\(^{2}\)-F-hr/BTU)
\item
  Interior film coefficient = Calculated by EnergyPlus convection algorithm
\item
  No incident solar beam radiation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Field: Area (Net)}\label{field-area-net}

When surfaces are entered, the gross area of the surface is calculated from the vertices (except for Internal Mass where it is entered directly). As net area is needed in the calculations, any sub-surfaces to the primary surface are subtracted from the original gross area. This field will show the final ``net'' area for the surface. For example, walls with windows will have the multiplier (of the window) * window area subtracted from the gross amount. Likewise, any divider area (including multipliers) for the window will be subtracted. Units for this field are m\(^{2}\).

\subsubsection{Field: Area (Gross)}\label{field-area-gross}

This field shows the gross area of the surface. Units for this field are m\(^{2}\).

\subsubsection{Field: Area (Sunlit Calc)}\label{field-area-sunlit-calc}

This field shows the net area for the purposes of sunlit/shading calculations. For these, only 1 unit of a multiplied window/door is subtracted from the gross area of a wall that the window/door is on. This net area includes the \emph{frame area} (if any) for the windows on the wall. For windows, this value includes the divider area of the window. Thus for both frames and dividers, there will be a * in this field -- since the areas are included in the wall/window areas. Units for this field are m\(^{2}\).

\subsubsection{Field: \textasciitilde{}Width}\label{field-width}

This field (approximate width of the surface) is calculated and filled by EnergyPlus from the entered vertices. Some parts of EnergyPlus use a width and height rather than the more detailed vertex/area calculations. Units for this field are m.

\subsubsection{Field: \textasciitilde{}Height}\label{field-height}

This field (approximate height of the surface) is calculated and filled by EnergyPlus from the entered vertices. Some parts of EnergyPlus use a width and height rather than the more detailed vertex/area calculations. Units for this field are m.

If this is a special surface with ``Other Side Coefficients'', the value will be the OtherSideCoefficient name (see description of OtherSideCoefficient reporting later in this document). If this is a special surface with ``Other Side Condition Model'', the value will be the OtherSideConditionModel name.

\subsubsection{Field: \textless{}WindExposure\textgreater{}}\label{field-windexposure}

The value for this field will be \textbf{WindExposed} or \textbf{NoWind}. Internal surfaces should have NoWind exposure.

\subsubsection{Field: ViewFactorToGround}\label{field-viewfactortoground}

\subsubsection{Field: ViewFactorToSky}\label{field-viewfactortosky}

This value is calculated by EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces.

\subsubsection{Field: ViewFactorToGround-IR}\label{field-viewfactortoground-ir}

This value is calculated by EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces. Shadowing surfaces are considered to have the same emissivity and temperature as the ground, so they are lumped together with the ground in calculating the ground IR view factor.

\subsubsection{Field: ViewFactorToSky-IR}\label{field-viewfactortosky-ir}

This value is calculated by EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces.

\subsubsection{Field: \#Sides}\label{field-sides}

This value is the number of sides / vertices the surface has.

\subsubsection{Field: Combined convective/radiative film coefficient}\label{field-combined-convectiveradiative-film-coefficient}

This field is a trigger value. When entered as \textgreater{}0, it is used as the combined convective/radiative film coefficient. The other fields in the OtherSideCoefficient object are used then as well: the remaining fields are used first to calculate the outdoor air temperature for the surface and then to calculate the outside surface temperature based on the outdoor air temperature and the film coefficient. If this field contains \textbf{N/A}, then the remaining fields are used to calculate the surface temperature (not the outdoor air temperature).

\subsubsection{Field: User selected Constant Temperature}\label{field-user-selected-constant-temperature}

If this field contains a value, then constant temperature field will be \textbf{N/A} in this report.

\subsection{Construction Element Outputs}\label{construction-element-outputs}

\subsection{Opaque Constructions}\label{opaque-constructions}

\subsubsection{Description of the Opaque Construction Report}\label{description-of-the-opaque-construction-report}

The Opaque Construction report has 3 parts for each construction.

Part 1 is the construction name along with some derived values for the entire construction (i.e.~Thermal Conductance) as well as noting other details about the surface (\# CTFs, \#~ Layers).

Part 2 shows the material layers for the construction. This is essentially just an echo of the entered properties of the materials from the IDF.

Part 3 shows the CTFs as calculated for the Construction. CTFs are described more completely in the Engineering Reference document.

\subsubsection{Fields in Part 1 -- Opaque Construction Report}\label{fields-in-part-1-opaque-construction-report}

\subsubsection{Field: \textless{}Construction\textgreater{}}\label{field-construction-1}

This will be filled with the constant ``Construction'' for each Construction line.

\subsubsection{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name}

This is the name of the construction as entered in the IDF.

\subsubsection{Field: \#Layers}\label{field-layers}

This is the number of material layers inferred from the construction entry in the IDF. Material layers are listed ``outside'' to ``inside'' of the construction. This, of course, depends on the placement of the surface in the building -- the ``outside'' of an internal surface is the layer that is closest to whatever the surface touches whereas the ``inside'' of an internal surface is the layer that shows in the surface's ``zone''. The outside of an external surface is the layer that faces the outside environment and, again, the inside is the layer that shows in the zone.

\subsubsection{Field: \#CTFs}\label{field-ctfs}

This is the calculated number of CTFs (Conduction Transfer Functions). The conduction transfer functions are temperature and flux coefficients that characterize the thermal properties of the wall.

\subsubsection{Field: Time Step}\label{field-time-step}

The ``timestep'' in the construction line is the timestep at which the CTFs are valid. Because CTFs for certain constructions might not be stable at the user specified timestep (might be too ``heavy'' from a thermal mass standpoint), this may be different from the zone timestep (specified in ``TimeStep in Hour''). In all cases though, this will be greater than or equal to the zone timestep. If the timestep for the construction is greater than the zone timestep, E+ will use interpolated histories to solve for the surface heat balances for this surface (see discussion on interpolated histories in the \href{file:///E:/Docs4PDFs/EngineeringDoc.pdf}{Engineering Reference} document).

\subsubsection{Field: Thermal Conductance}\label{field-thermal-conductance}

This is the nominal thermal conductance of the construction calculated without film coefficients. Units are w/m\(^{2}\)-K.

\subsubsection{Field: Outer Thermal Absorptance}\label{field-outer-thermal-absorptance}

This will be the thermal absorptance of the outer material layer.

\subsubsection{Field: Inner Thermal Absorptance}\label{field-inner-thermal-absorptance}

This will be the thermal absorptance of the inner material layer.

\subsubsection{Field: Outer Solar Absorptance}\label{field-outer-solar-absorptance}

This will be the solar absorptance of the outer material layer.

\subsubsection{Field: Inner Solar Absorptance}\label{field-inner-solar-absorptance}

This will be the solar absorptance of the inner material layer.

\subsubsection{Field: Roughness}\label{field-roughness}

The construction takes on the roughness from the outer material layer. Roughness is used in several parts of external environment calculations.

\subsubsection{Fields in Part 2 -- Opaque Construction Report}\label{fields-in-part-2-opaque-construction-report}

\textbf{Line 2:} ! \textless{}Material\textgreater{},Material Name,Thickness \{m\},Conductivity \{w/m-K\},Density \{kg/m3\},Specific Heat \{J/kg-K\},ThermalResistance \{m2-K/w\}

In this version of part 2, the full material properties are entered by the user and displayed in the report.

\subsubsection{Field: \textless{}Material\textgreater{}}\label{field-material}

This will be filled with the constant ``Material'' for each material layer line.

\subsubsection{Field: Material Name}\label{field-material-name}

This is the name of the material as entered in the IDF.

\subsubsection{Field: Thickness}\label{field-thickness}

This is the entered thickness of the material. Units are m.

\subsubsection{Field: Conductivity}\label{field-conductivity}

For Material:Regular materials, this will be the entered conductivity in w/m-K. For Material:Regular-R materials, this will be shown as 0.0.

\subsubsection{Field: Density}\label{field-density}

For Material:Regular materials, this will be the entered density in kg/m\(^{3}\). For Material:Regular-R materials, this will be shown as 0.0.

\subsubsection{Field: Specific Heat}\label{field-specific-heat}

For Material:Regular materials, this will be the entered specific heat in J/kg-K. For Material:Regular-R materials, this will be shown as 0.0.

\subsubsection{Field: Thermal Resistance}\label{field-thermal-resistance}

For Material:Regular-R materials, this is the entered thermal resistance in m\(^{2}\)-K/w. For Material:Regular materials, this is the calculated thermal resistance based on the other properties.

\textbf{Line 3:} ! \textless{}Material:Air\textgreater{},Material Name,ThermalResistance \{m2-K/w\}

In this version of part 2, only the thermal resistance of the air layer is entered by the user and displayed in the report.

\subsubsection{Field: \textless{}Material:Air\textgreater{}}\label{field-materialair}

This will be filled with the constant ``Material:Air'' for each material layer line.

\subsubsection{Field: Material Name}\label{field-material-name-1}

This is the name of the material as entered in the IDF.

\subsubsection{Field: Thermal Resistance}\label{field-thermal-resistance-1}

This is the entered thermal resistance in m\(^{2}\)-K/w.

\subsubsection{Fields in Part 3 -- Opaque Construction Report}\label{fields-in-part-3-opaque-construction-report}

\textbf{Line 4:} ! \textless{}CTF\textgreater{},Time,Outside,Cross,Inside,Flux (except final one)

In part 3, the CTF calculations are shown. It is necessary to use the conduction transfer functions labeled ``Inside'' and ``Cross'' to calculate the heat flux at the inside surface and the conduction transfer functions labeled ``Outside'' and ``Cross'' to calculate the heat flux at the outside surface. Inside and outside coefficients will be identical for symmetric walls.

Conduction through constructions such as walls, roofs, floors, etc. is generally characterized as one-dimensional and transient within EnergyPlus. The solution to this partial differential equation results in ``conduction transfer functions'' or CTFs. In a CTF equation, the current heat transfer flux due to conduction through a construction is a function of the current temperature at either face of the surface as well as the history of temperatures at either face and the history of conductive fluxes at this face. CTFs are a simplification of response factors which are based solely on temperature histories and require an ``infinite'' history. The inclusion of heat flux history terms reduces the overall number of terms in the equation for conductive flux significantly, resulting in a more efficient solution.

For each unique combination of materials, there are a unique set of CTFs. While there are other procedures to determine the CTFs for a particular construction, EnergyPlus uses a state-space method (see conduction transfer function documentation) to obtain the CTF coefficients. These coefficients are calculated once at the beginning of the simulation and are constant for a particular construction. The CTF equation itself is a linear equation with these constant coefficients.

Conduction heat transfer flux at the outside face of a particular surface is a function of the construction of the surface (which leads to the CTF coefficients), the current and previous temperatures at both the inside and outside face of the surface, and the previous conduction heat transfer fluxes at the outside surface. The CTF coefficients that would be used in this equation would be the ``Outside'' (multiplied by the temperature history at the outside face) terms, the ``Cross'' (multiplied by the temperature history at the inside face) terms, and the ``Flux'' (multiplied by the flux history at the outside face) terms. Solving for the conductive flux at the inside surface would require the use of the ``Inside'' (multiplied by the temperature history at the inside face) terms, the ``Cross'' (multiplied by the temperature history at the outside face) terms, and the ``Flux'' (multiplied by the flux history at the inside face) terms. A textual example is given below for illustration purposes:

Current Outside Conductive Flux = (Outside Term 0) * (Current Outside Face Temperature)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Outside Term 1) * (Previous Outside Face Temperature)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Outside Term 2) * (Outside Face Temperature 2 Time Steps Ago)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Outside Term 3) * (Outside Face Temperature 3 Time Steps Ago)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + \ldots{}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Cross Term 0) * (Current Inside Face Temperature)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Cross Term 1) * (Previous Inside Face Temperature)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Cross Term 2) * (Inside Face Temperature 2 Time Steps Ago)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Cross Term 3) * (Inside Face Temperature 3 Time Steps Ago)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + \ldots{}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Flux Term 1) * (Previous Outside Face Flux)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Flux Term 2) * (Outside Face Flux 2 Time Steps Ago)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +(Flux Term 3) * (Outside Face Flux 3 Time Steps Ago)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + \ldots{}

The number of terms is based on the CTF coefficient calculation routine and is related to the amount of thermal mass contained within a particular construction. Actual signs (positive or negative) of various terms in the preceding equation will vary based on their definition and use within the equation. Those interested in more details on the use and calculation of CTFs are encouraged to read the Engineering Documentation.

\subsubsection{Field: \textless{}CTF\textgreater{}}\label{field-ctf}

This will be filled with the constant ``CTF'' for each CTF coefficient line.

\subsubsection{Field: Time}\label{field-time}

This field ``time'' refers to the history term to which the coefficients are applied. The last line is the ``zero'' term that gets applied to the current values of temperatures. The line with a ``1'' refers to the temperatures and fluxes from the previous timestep--previous as in time minus one timestep. Timestep, in this case, is defined by the construction timestep (see description on ``Fields in Part 1 -- Opaque Construction Report'') \emph{not} the zone timestep. Lines with other values are for previous timesteps at t-n(timestep). These are the terms that are used to model conduction through a construction.

This is the number of material layers inferred from the windows construction entry in the IDF. Material layers are listed ``outside'' to ``inside'' of the construction. This, of course, depends on the placement of the surface in the building -- the ``outside'' of an internal surface is the layer that is closest to whatever the surface touches whereas the ``inside'' of an internal surface is the layer that shows in the surface's ``zone''. The outside of an external surface is the layer that faces the outside environment and, again, the inside is the layer that shows in the zone.

The following transmittance and reflectance values are for the window glazing (plus shade, screen or blind, if present in the construction). For exterior windows, ``front'' means the side of the window facing the exterior environment and ``back'' means the side facing the zone. For interior windows, ``front'' means the side to window facing the zone and ``back'' means the side facing the adjacent zone.

\textbf{! \textless{}Load Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation Averaging Window\textgreater{}, Value}

~Load Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation Averaging Window,~~~ 1

\subsubsection{Field: Load Timesteps in Zone Design Calculation Averaging Window}\label{field-load-timesteps-in-zone-design-calculation-averaging-window}

The number of load timesteps in the zone design flow sequence averaging window. The default is 1, in which case the calculated zone design flow rates are averaged over the load timestep.

The zone design air flow rate calculation is performed assuming a potentially infinite supply of heating or cooling air at a fixed temperature. Thus, the calculated design air flow rate will always be able to meet any load or change in load no matter how large or abrupt. In reality air flow rates are limited by duct sizes and fan capacities. The idealized zone design flow calculation may result in unrealistically large flow rates, especially if the user is performing the sizing calculations using thermostat schedules with night setup or setback. The calculated zone design flow rates are always averaged over the load timestep. The user may want to perform a broader average to mitigate the effect of thermostat setup and setback and prevent the warm up or cool down flow rates from dominating the design flow rate calculation. Specifying the width of the averaging window allows the user to do this.

For example, if the load calculation timestep is 15 minutes and the user specifies the \emph{timesteps in averaging window}to be 4, the zone design air flows will be averaged over a time period of 1 hour. Specifying 8 would result in averaging over a 2 hour period.

\subsubsection{Field: \textless{}Component Sizing Information\textgreater{}}\label{field-component-sizing-information}

This field simply contains the words ``Component Sizing''.

\subsubsection{Field: ~Component Type}\label{field-component-type}

This field shows the component type (e.g.~Pump:Variable Speed, Plant Loop, Fan:Simple:VariableVolume) being sized.

\subsubsection{Field: ~Component Name}\label{field-component-name}

This field shows the name of the component.

\subsubsection{Field: ~Input Field Description}\label{field-input-field-description}

This field shows the field description/variable with units. When using HVAC Sizing Simulation for advanced sizing methods, there are two versions of the report for each component that might be affected. With HVAC Sizing Simulation, there is a first size value reported, which is the result of the Ideal Loads Sizing Simulation, and there is the final value after all the Sizing Passes have completed. This input field description will have ``Initial'' prepended to the description to indicate that this is the first size, the same report without ``Initial'' is the final size. Note that with HVAC Sizing Simulation, these reports will occur much later in the simulation and hence appear further down in the .eio file.

\subsubsection{Field: ~Value}\label{field-value-2}

This field shows the value of the sized component.

The refrigeration output in the \textbf{eplusout.eio} file shows the number of refrigeration compressor racks, detailed refrigeration systems, detailed transcritical refrigeration systems, and secondary refrigeration systems found in the input data file (IDF). Additional information is shown for each compressor rack and the refrigerated case(s) and walk-in(s) connected to each compressor rack. For the detailed systems, additional information is shown for each refrigerated case(s), walk-in(s), cascade loads, secondary loads, mechanical subcooler loads, compressors, condenser, and mechanical and liquid suction heat exchanger subcoolers connected to the system. For the detailed transcritical refrigeration systems, additional information is shown for each refrigerated case(s), walk-in(s), compressor and gas cooler connected to the system. For secondary refrigeration systems, additional information is shown for each refrigerated case(s) and walk-in(s) connected to the system. For walk-ins, additional information is shown for each zone exchanging energy with that walk-in.

The refrigeration ``header'' records (lines starting with an ``!'') precede all the data lines. The data lines are grouped, showing the number of refrigeration compressor racks specified in the input data file followed by lines that reflect the information for each refrigeration compressor rack followed by the information for each refrigerated case and walk-in connected to this rack. The number of detailed systems is followed by a group of data lines describing the input values for the detailed refrigeration systems and similarly for the secondary refrigeration systems.

This output reflects information for the specified refrigeration equipment along with entries from the IDF (or default data for blank fields). The data are preceded by a description (i.e. \#Refrigeration Compressor Racks, Refrigeration Compressor Rack, Refrigerated Case, \#Orphaned Refrigerated Cases, and Orphaned Refrigerated Case) followed by the information associated with each description.

A final set of ``header'' records and descriptions are output only when a refrigeration object is found in the IDF but is not connected to a refrigeration compressor rack or refrigeration system object (i.e., orphaned).

\subsection{View Factor Info}\label{view-factor-info}

A semi-debugging, informational report on View Factors for each zone/surface is available when you add \textbf{Output:Diagnostics,DisplayAdvancedReportVariables;} to your input file.

After EnergyPlus receives the geometry information for the building, it calculates the view factors and grey interchange information for each zone and surface. These are used to calculate the interior radiant exchange between surfaces. The first set is called the approximate view factors; then, a deeper evaluation of the zone's geometry and surfaces is performed to see if corrections need to be applied. Three sets of values are provided for the user's information.

! \textless{}Surface View Factor Check Values\textgreater{},ZoneName,Original Check Value,Calculated Fixed Check Value,Final Check Value

Surface View Factor Check Values,ZONE ONE,8.881784E-016,8.637788E-004,8.881784E-016

\subsubsection{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-15}

This is the zone name for the values.

\subsubsection{Field: Original Check Value}\label{field-original-check-value}

Original check value as submitted to the ``Test and Check'' routine. This value represents the Sum of the N (number of surfaces) by N matrix -- the Number of Surfaces. Ideally, it should be very close to zero. The original check value could come from either the User inputting the view factors for the zone or the approximate view factor calculation in EnergyPlus.

\subsubsection{Field: Calculated Fixed Check Value}\label{field-calculated-fixed-check-value}

This is the value of the view factor matrix (i.e.~SUM(NXNmatrix -- N) after the fix routine has applied them.

\subsubsection{Field: Final Check Value}\label{field-final-check-value}

This value should match one of the previous values and indicate whether the original matrix or the modfied/fixed matrix will be used in the calculations.

\subsection{View Factor Details}\label{view-factor-details}

View factors for zones (surfaces) can be entered into the input file (object: ZoneProperty:UserViewFactors) if desired. Or they can be reported from the input file. The following describes the reporting of these view factors. You can report the surface view factor information by using:

Output:Surfaces:List,ViewFactorInfo;

This triggers EnergyPlus to produce a special output section in the file eplusout.eio. This file, which is csv format, can be opened in Excel, and will show detailed information about the surfaces in all the zones.

In order to get user view factors ready for inclusion in an input file, several steps much be taken. \emph{First, because EnergyPlus has a data structure for zones that only is defined at initialization, it is necessary to use EnergyPlus to determine the surface numbers (i,j) before a UserViewFactors object can be constructed.} (This is a known defect -- a new object is being defined that will make this unnecessary). THIS STILL NEEDS TO BE REVISED BASE ON IF WE GO FOR NEW INPUT OR NOT.

\subsubsection{Final View Factors}\label{final-view-factors}

This section/lines shows view factors after they have been corrected for reciprocity and completeness. Correction may be necessary to make sure any two surfaces exchange radiation reciprocally, that is, the radiation leaving one surface directed at another surface is the same as the amount of radiation arriving at the other surface, and that the sum of all the radiant energy exchanges in the zone is zero. If the user input view factors are perfect in these characteristics, the correction will not change them. The displayed lines show what view factors will be used during the simulation.

\subsubsection{Script F Factors}\label{script-f-factors}

Finally, grey interchange coefficients are presented. These are the coefficients that are used to calculate the radiant energy exchange between the surfaces in the zone. They are calculated to include reflection from intervening surfaces in the zone.

As described elsewhere, EnergyPlus simulates the first day of each simulation period until it reaches “convergence”. This data line will show how many warm up days were required to reach that state.

\begin{lstlisting}
! <Environment:WarmupDays>, NumberofWarmupDays
Environment:WarmupDays,  6
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Field: <Environment:WarmupDays>}

This is a constant that will display ``Environment:WarmupDays''.

\subsubsection{Field: NumberofWarmupDays}

This field will show the number of days required to reach the convergence state for the simulation.

\subsection{Warmup Convergence Outputs}

Warmup is performed for each environment being simulated. When a file passes convergence, no warnings are shown.  However, when it doesn’t a warning appears in the eplusout.err file, for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
CheckWarmupConvergence: Loads Initialization, Zone = "BACKROOM" did not converge after 25 warmup days.
\end{lstlisting}

See Warmup Convergence Information in .eio file for details

\begin{lstlisting}
...Environment(RunPeriod) = "Phoenix Sky Harbor Intl Ap AZ USA TMY3 WMO# = 722780"

..Max Temp Comparison = 8.46E-005 vs Temperature Convergence Tolerance = 0.40 - Pass Convergence

..Min Temp Comparison = 7.05E-002 vs Temperature Convergence Tolerance = 0.40 - Pass Convergence

..Max Heat Load Comparison = 9.8513E-002 vs Loads Convergence Tolerance = 4.00E-002 - Fail Convergence

..Max Cool Load Comparison = 8.2481E-003 vs Loads Convergence Tolerance = 4.00E-002 - Pass Convergence
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Warmup Convergence Information}

Warmup convergence information reflects the warmup days calculations and whether or not the zone has reached “convergence”. Warmup calculations are done for each environment (e.g. each sizing period simulated, each run period simulated). Reference the building parameters on Minimum and Maximum Number of Warmup Days as well as Loads and Temperature convergence Tolerance. The file contains two possible flavors of warmup information: summary and detailed.

\subsection{Summary Warmup Convergence Information}

Summary (warmup convergance information is not reported during sizing and only at the end of the calculations). The below information is included after each warmup period.
