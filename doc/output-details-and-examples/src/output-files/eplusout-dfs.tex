\section{eplusout.dfs}\label{eplusout.dfs}

The daylight factors report contains the pre-calculated hourly daylight factors for the four CIE sky types (clear, clear turbid, intermediate, and overcast sky) and two daylight reference points for each exterior window of a daylight zone. The file is CSV formatted -- ready for spreadsheet viewing. The input for requesting the report is simple:

The following shows an excerpt the daylight factors for a window without shade:

This file contains daylight factors for all exterior windows of daylight zones.

If only one reference point the last 4 columns in the data will be zero.

The Window State column has three possible outputs -- Base Window indicating windows without shades; a numeric value, from 0.0 to 180.0 for every 10.0 step, indicating the slat angle (in degrees) of the blind shading the window; blink indicating windows in shaded state by shades, screens, and blinds with fixed slat angle.

The third line describes the hourly daylight factors. Note that the last 4 columns are 0.0 because there is only one daylight reference point.:
