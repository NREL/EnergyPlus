The daylight factors report contains the pre-calculated hourly daylight factors for the four CIE sky types (clear, clear turbid, intermediate, and overcast sky), for each daylight reference points for each exterior window of a daylight zone. The file is CSV formatted -- ready for spreadsheet viewing. The input for requesting the report is simple:

\begin{lstlisting}

The following shows an excerpt the daylight factors for a window without shade:

The first line describes the data in the \textbf{eplusout.dfs} file.

The second line describes the header of the daily row:

The Window State column has three possible outputs -- ``Base Window'' indicating windows without shades; a numeric value, from 0.0 to 180.0 for every 10.0 step, indicating the slat angle (in degrees) of the blind shading the window; ``Blind or Slat Applied'' indicating windows in shaded state by shades, screens, and blinds with fixed slat angle.

The lines after it describes the hourly daylight factors at each reference point:
