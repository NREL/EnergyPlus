This file contains the “meter details” for the run. This shows what report variables are on which meters and vice versa – which meters contain what report variables.

The meter details file consists of two parts:

\begin{itemize}
  \item For report variables that are on meters, it shows all the meters that the report variable is on.  In the following example, ``Meters for '' <report variable \#>, <report variable name> is shown and then the meters that accumulate the value of that variable as a “meter”.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
 Meters for 1240,SPACE1-1:Lights-Electric Energy [J]
  OnMeter = Electricity:Facility [J]
  OnMeter = Electricity:Building [J]
  OnMeter = Electricity:Zone:SPACE1-1 [J]
  OnMeter = InteriorLights:Electricity [J]
  OnMeter = InteriorLights:Electricity:Zone:SPACE1-1 [J]
 Meters for 1460,SPACE1-1:Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy [J]
  OnMeter = EnergyTransfer:Facility [J]
  OnMeter = EnergyTransfer:Building [J]
  OnMeter = EnergyTransfer:Zone:SPACE1-1 [J]
  OnMeter = Heating:EnergyTransfer [J]
 Meters for 1557,SPACE1-1 ZONE COIL:Heating Coil Heating Energy [J]
  OnMeter = EnergyTransfer:Facility [J]
  OnMeter = EnergyTransfer:HVAC [J]
  OnMeter = HeatingCoils:EnergyTransfer [J]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For each meter, the report variables that make up that meter are shown. In the following example, ``For Meter = '' <name of meter>, ``contents are:'' and then each variable that occurs on that ``meter'' are shown.
\end{itemize}

\end{lstlisting}

As further illustration, an abbreviated example shows:

\begin{lstlisting}
Meters for 6,EAST ZONE LIGHTS 1:Lights Electric Energy [J]
  OnMeter = Electricity:Facility [J]
  OnMeter = Electricity:Building [J]
  OnMeter = Electricity:Zone:EAST ZONE [J]
  OnMeter = InteriorLights:Electricity [J]
  OnMeter = InteriorLights:Electricity:Zone:EAST ZONE [J]
  OnMeter = GeneralLights:InteriorLights:Electricity [J]

For Meter = Electricity:Facility [J], ResourceType = Electricity, contents are:
  EAST ZONE LIGHTS 1:Lights Electric Energy
  NORTH ZONE LIGHTS 1:Lights Electric Energy
  WEST ZONE ELECEQ 1:Electric Equipment Electric Energy
  EAST ZONE ELECEQ 1:Electric Equipment Electric Energy
  NORTH ZONE ELECEQ 1:Electric Equipment Electric Energy

\end{lstlisting}

This shows the meters on which the Zone: Lights Electric Energy appear as well as the contents of the Electricity:Facility meter.
