\section{eplusout.bnd}\label{eplusout.bnd}

The ``branch node details'' (bnd) file is intended to give enough information that one could (with a chosen software) diagram the nodes and components of the HVAC system. It may or may not achieve that objective. Of more use may be its illustration of node connection/branch errors that aren't detected by the software. This file has the details to support any ``node connection'' errors that will be noted in the eplusout.err file. Branch validation is shown in this file. Branches are checked to assure that each output node of the branch element is an input node to the next branch element. Cross-branch checking is not done directly within the program though the details will illustrate some problems of that nature.

Supply and Return Air Paths are also checked and feedback about each item are shown.

As is standard with many EnergyPlus output files, this file is CSV (comma-delimited) such that it can be read by spreadsheet programs for further manipulation by the user.

An example will illustrate. Notes about the reporting are highlighted in green.
