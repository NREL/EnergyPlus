\section{Output File List}\label{output-file-list}

Following are the native file names that are output from EnergyPlus; native -- directly out of EnergyPlus. Usually you will not see these file names as batch files and interfaces will change them to be \textless{}file name\textgreater{}.\textless{}ext\textgreater{} or in some instances \textless{}file name\textgreater{}\textless{}qualifier\textgreater{}.\textless{}ext\textgreater{}. Usually the extension is the important piece and is described in the following table.

In addition to the basic output files from EnergyPlus there are three standard ``hybrid'' output files. These are called ``hybrid'' because they are a result of post-processing after EnergyPlus has completed. Note that if there is an error during processing, these will not normally be ``complete''.

eplusout. < ext >  ~ & “spreadsheet” ready file that contains either all the report variables requested (default: up to limit of 255) from the input file or specific ones specified by the user. Different extensions (csv, tab, and txt denote different “separators” in the file. & < filename > .csv or  < filename > .tab or  < filename > .txt \tabularnewline
eplusmtr. < ext >  ~ & “spreadsheet” ready file that contains either all the report meter requests (default: up to 255) from the input file or specific ones specified by the user.

Now, each file will be described in more detail with some examples of use.
