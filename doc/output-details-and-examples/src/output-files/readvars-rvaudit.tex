This file is available from standard EnergyPlus runs (batch file, EP-Launch, etc) where the included utility ``ReadVarsESO'' is used to create .csv or other delimited files. It shows what steps were taken during the read vars run(s) -- in standard EnergyPlus runs there are two: one for the .eso file and one for the .mtr file. Note that ReadVarsESO will not be run if native CSV output is generated with  OutputControl:Files. Contents might be:
