\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This document provides an in-depth look at plant modeling in EnergyPlus. Plant refers to the subset of HVAC that involves hydronic equipment for heating, cooling, and service water heating (or domestic hot water).

This guide serves as an aid to help model plant systems in EnergyPlus simulations. It is intended to augment the Input Output Reference, which describes the syntax and the details of individual input objects. This guide will discuss how the different objects can be used to construct a plant loop that can service a building load.
