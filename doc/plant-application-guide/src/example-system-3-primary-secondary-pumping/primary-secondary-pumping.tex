\section{Primary/Secondary Pumping}\label{primarysecondary-pumping}

As mentioned in sections \emph{Primary Cooling System Supply Side Loop Construction} and \emph{Secondary Chilled Water Loop Supply Side Loop Construction}, the CW primary Circ Pump and the CW Sec Circ Pump function as the primary/secondary (respectively) pumping system. The primary pump is a constant speed pump that circulates chilled water at a constant flow rate through one side the plate heat exchanger in the primary chilled water loop. The secondary pump is a variable speed pump that circulates chilled water at a variable flow rate through the other side of the plate heat exchanger depending on the demand load.
