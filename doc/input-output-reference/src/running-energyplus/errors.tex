\section{Errors}\label{errors}

The \textbf{eplusout.err} file may contain three levels of errors (Information, Warning, Severe, Fatal) as well as the possibility of just message lines, see Table~\ref{table:energyplus-errors-and-required-actions}. EnergyPlus Errors and Required Actions. These errors may be duplicated in other files (such as the standard output file). These errors are described more completely in the Output Details and Examples document. An example .err file from the 1ZoneUncontrolled example input file:

EnergyPlus produces several messages as it is executing, as a guide to its progress. These message illustrate the sequence of execution as well as provides checkpoints should the simulation fail.

For example, the run of the 1ZoneUncontrolled example input file produces the log:

In the example, the inclusion of the ``ReadVars'' program is also shown. It is run twice -- once for the \textbf{eplusout.eso} file and once for the \textbf{eplusout.mtr} file.
