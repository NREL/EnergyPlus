\section{Energy+.ini}\label{energy.ini}

The Energy+.ini file is read by the EnergyPlus.exe program and is \emph{very important} to the simulation run. In specific, this file contains a pointer to where the Energy+.idd file will be found. More description of the Energy+.ini contents is contained in the Auxiliary Programs document.

For the advanced user, there is also the ``EPMacro'' program, described in the Auxiliary programs document. You run it as a separate program before EnergyPlus (the batch file included in the install and shown in the GettingStarted document contains the commands). It is automatically run if you use the EP-Launch program.

EnergyPlus may create several output files. Whether some files are produced depends on the actual simulation (for example, the .rdd file is only produced when you request a Variable Dictionary using the Output:Report object). Similarly, the .dxf file is only produced when a DXF surface report is requested. Common output files are shown in the following table. A complete, up to date list is shown in the ``Output Details and Examples Document''.

Eplusout.audit & Echo of input \tabularnewline
Eplusout.err & Error file \tabularnewline
Eplusout.eso & Standard Output File (contains results from both Output:Variable and Output:Meter objects). \tabularnewline
Eplusout.eio & One time output file \tabularnewline
Eplusout.rdd & Output variable Data Dictionary \tabularnewline
Eplusout.dxf & DXF (from Output:Report,Surfaces,DXF;) \tabularnewline
Eplusout.mtr & Similar to .eso but only has Meter outputs. \tabularnewline
Eplusout.mtd & Meter details report – what variables are on what meters and vice versa. \tabularnewline
Eplusout.end & A one line summary of success or failure (useful for Interface programs) \tabularnewline
Eplusout.dbg & From Debug Output object – may be useful to support to help track down problems \tabularnewline
Eplusout. < ext > & Not directly from EnergyPlus – produced by utility programs that read the .eso file and produce output files for spreadsheet programs \tabularnewline
Eplusout.sln & Similar to DXF output but less “formatted”. Results of Report Surface, Lines object. \tabularnewline
Epluszsz. < ext > & Results from the Zone Sizing object with extension noted by the Sizing Style object. This file is “spreadsheet” ready. \tabularnewline
Eplusssz. < ext > & Results from the System Sizing object with extension noted by the Sizing Style object. This file is “spreadsheet” ready. \tabularnewline
Eplusout.bnd & This file contains details about the nodes and branches. Useful in determining if all your nodes are connected correctly. \tabularnewline
Eplustbl. < ext > & Results from various “Report Table” and a few other reporting commands. The extension is from the “style” command and this file is “spreadsheet” ready. \tabularnewline
