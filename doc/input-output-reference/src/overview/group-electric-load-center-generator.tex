\section{Group -- Electric Load Center-Generator Specifications}\label{group-electric-load-center-generator-specifications}

This group of input objects is related to electric power serving the facility. EnergyPlus has models for various types of electric generators and power conditioning devices that might be part of the electric power system serving the building being modeled. Buildings with simple utility electric power service will not necesarily need any of the models in this group. All EnergyPlus models that have any electric power consumption are assumed to have a straightforward connection to utility grid service and no extra input is needed. The models in this group of inputs are useful for facilities that more complex electric power service such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Utility service is at a voltage higher than used in the building and a transformer conditions power coming into to the building as part of the facility.
\item
  On site generators produce electricity within the facility. For example solar photovoltaic panels or natural gas powered electric generators.
\item
  On site electric storage devices.
\end{itemize}

For facilities that own their transformer, and the utility services is metered on the high voltage side, the ElectricLoadCenter:Transformer object can be used, and may be the only input object needed.

All other applications involving on-site generation or storage will require at least one ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution to describe the arrangement and control of a set of electric power devices. Each of these load centers is like a subpanel connected to the main electrical panel for the facility. The main panel is assumed to exist whenever the rest of the model includes something that consumes electricity (and does not require any input object). Each ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution input object describes what devices are on a subpanel connected to the main panel, as well as how they are controlled, dispatched, and arranged to provide some service related to the facility's electric power. The ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution object manages and calls the individual generator models that are connected to it by being listed in an ElectricLoadCenter:Generators object, such as natural gas powered turbines, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, etc. Unlike elsewhere in EnergyPlus where there are loops, branches, or generic equipment lists that allow describing custom arrangements, the electric power service modeling is restricted to a collection of predefined arrangements, called ``buss types.'' Many on site generation and storage configurations common in buildings can be modeled using just one ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution object. However, by combining multiple load centers with different equipment and operations schemes, it is possible to model more complex configurations. (Note that when using multiple ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects, the order of the ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects within the input file determines the order in which they are called to interact with the main panel.)

The following diagram shows some of the devices and arrangements that can be modeled using the inputs in this group.

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Transformer}\label{electricloadcentertransformer}

This object is used to model the energy losses of transformers when they are used to transfer electricity from the grid to a building (as distribution transformers) or transfer electricity from onsite generators to the grid. Distribution transformers reduce the voltage on utility distribution lines (34.5 kV or less) to a lower secondary voltage (600 V or less) suitable for customer equipment. According to the medium used for cooling and insulation, distribution transformers can be classified into liquid-immersed and dry type transformers. According to the input voltages, distribution transformers can be classified into medium-voltage (between 600 V and 34.5kV) and low-voltage transformer (less than 600 V). The transformers used to output the surplus electricity from onsite generators to the grid usually match the cogeneration voltage to the grid. This object can be used for all types of distribution transformers and the transformers used to output electricity from onsite generators to the grid, but the model defaults applies to the low-voltage dry type transformers because they are the most common type found in commercial and industrial facilities.

Energy losses in transformers consist of the no load (core) loss and the load (winding) loss. The no load loss comes primarily from the switching of the magnetic fields in the core material. It is roughly constant and exists continuously in the core material as long as the transformer is energized. The load loss comes from the electrical resistance in the windings when there is a load on the transformer. The load loss is proportional to the load squared with a small temperature correction. The energy losses at a given load depend on the transformer s performance. This object provides the user two alternative ways to indicate the transformer s performance. First, the user can provide the no load loss and load loss at rated conditions. Second, the user can provide the nameplate efficiency and the corresponding reference conditions. The detailed algorithms to calculate the energy losses are described in the Engineering Reference.

The user needs to specify which loads are connected to the transformer. This is achieved in different manners depending on the transformer usage. For a distribution transformer, the user needs to provide a number of electric meters wired to that transformer. The input object can currently accommodate up to ten meters, but it is extensible by modifying the Energy+.idd entry. For a transformer used to output electricity from onsite generators to the grid, the user needs to indicate the transformer name in the served electric load center.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-014}

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-005}

This alpha field contains the schedule name (ref. Schedule objects) that contains information on the availability of the transformer. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the transformer is available to convert AC power from one voltage to another. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the transformer is not available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Transformer Usage}\label{field-transformer-usage}

This field indicates one of the three supported transformer application types: PowerInFromGrid, PowerOutToGrid, and LoadCenterPowerConditioning. A PowerInFromGrid type of transformer is used to step down voltage from the electricity grid to the building. The transformer with this type of use is somewhat free standing and does not need to be referenced in any ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution object. There should be only one PowerInFromGrid transformer in the model. A PowerOutToGrid type of transformer is used to match voltage from the building to the electricity grid. This conditions power exported out of the facility and feed back into the grid. This type of transformer will only be needed if the building ever exports power and the building and grid connection have different voltages. There should be only one PowerOutToGrid transformer in the model and it will serve all the surplus electricity produced by electric load center(s). A LoadCenterPowerConditioning type of transformer is used to match voltage between an electic load center (subpanel) and the facility's main panel. Each electric load center can have its own transformer to condition power fed into the main panel. For electric load centers that also draw power from the main panel, to charge storage, the transformer is assumed to operate in both directions (at the same performance). This type of transformer should be named in an ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution object.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-005}

This field contains the name of the thermal zone where the transformer is located. Entering a valid name of zone here will direct EnergyPlus to include the transformer s losses as heat gains to the named thermal zone. If the transformer is not within a thermal zone, this field can be left blank and the thermal energy associated with transformer losses is removed from the building model.

\paragraph{Field: Radiative Fraction}\label{field-radiative-fraction}

This field contains the fraction of transformer s losses that enter the zone as long-wave thermal radiation. This numeric filed should have a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The balance of the losses is convective. This field is not used if the previous field for zone name is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Capacity}\label{field-rated-capacity}

This field defines the rated capacity of the transformer in VA.

\paragraph{Field: Phase}\label{field-phase}

This field indicates whether the transformer is a single phase or three phase type. The two alternative values are 1 or 3. The default is 3. This field is currently not used in the model.

\paragraph{Field: Conductor Material}\label{field-conductor-material}

This field specifies the winding material used by the transformer. There are two options: Copper and Aluminum. The choice will determine the thermal coefficient of resistance used to calculate the temperature correction factor for the transformer load losses. The default is Aluminum.

\paragraph{Field: Full Load Temperature Rise}\label{field-full-load-temperature-rise}

This numeric field defines the temperature rise of the windings above the ambient temperature, when the transformer is loaded at its nameplate rating. For liquid-immersed distribution transformers, the full load temperature rise usually takes the value of 65 \textdegreeC. For dry-type transformers, the temperature rise usually takes three optional values: 80, 115 and 150 \textdegreeC. This field accepts any value between the minimum (50 \textdegreeC) and the maximum (180 \textdegreeC). The default is 150 \textdegreeC.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction of Eddy Current Losses}\label{field-fraction-of-eddy-current-losses}

This field defines the fraction of load losses resulting from the eddy currents. Transformer's load losses comprise two parts: the ohmic loss due to the current flowing in the resistance of the windings and the eddy and stray losses due to the eddy currents. This field indicates the fraction of the load losses due to the eddy currents. This numeric field should have a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The default is 0.1.

\paragraph{Field: Performance Input Method}\label{field-performance-input-method-000}

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify the transformer performance: RatedLosses or NominalEfficiency. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be RatedLosses. If the method NominalEfficiency is selected, the user must enter the fields for the nameplate efficiency and the corresponding reference coditions as described below. If the method RatedLosses is selected, then the fields for rated no load loss and load loss must be entered as described below.

\paragraph{Field: Rated No Load Loss}\label{field-rated-no-load-loss}

This field defines the no load loss (W) at rated load and conditions. The no load loss is roughly constant and exists whenever the transformer is energized. The no load loss is also called the core loss. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as RatedLosses.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Load Loss}\label{field-rated-load-loss}

This field defines the load loss (W) at rated load and conditions. The load loss varies with the square of the load being served by the transformer. The load loss is also called the winding loss because the load loss occurs in the primary and secondary windings around the core. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as RatedLosses.

\paragraph{Field: Nameplate Efficiency}\label{field-nameplate-efficiency}

This field contains the value for transformer efficiency at a given per unit load and specified reference temperature. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as NominalEfficiency. The default is 0.98.

\paragraph{Field: Per Unit Load for Nameplate Efficiency}\label{field-per-unit-load-for-nameplate-efficiency}

This field defines the percentage of the rated capacity at which the nameplate efficiency is measured. According to the NEMA (National Electrical Manufactures Association) Standard TP-1, the per unit load takes the value of 0.35 for dry-type distribution transformers and it takes the value of 0.50 for liquid-filled distribution transformers. The default is 0.35.

\paragraph{Field: Reference Temperature for Nameplate Efficiency}\label{field-reference-temperature-for-nameplate-efficiency}

This field defines the conductor temperature at which the nameplate efficiency is measured. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as NominalEfficiency . According to the NEMA Standard TP-1, the reference temperature takes the value of 75 \textdegreeC for dry-type distribution transformers and it takes the value of 55 \textdegreeC for liquid-filled distribution transformers. The default is 75 \textdegreeC.

\paragraph{Field: Per Unit Load for Maximum Efficiency}\label{field-per-unit-load-for-maximum-efficiency}

This field defines the percentage of the rated capacity at which the maximum efficiency is obtained. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as NominalEfficiency . A blank field indicates that it takes the same value as the per unit load for nameplate efficiency.

\paragraph{Field: Consider Transformer Loss for Utility Cost}\label{field-consider-transformer-loss-for-utility-cost}

This field indicates whether the transformer losses are considered to calculate utility cost. This field applies to a PowerInFromGrid type of transformer. In some cases, the transformer losses are required but they are not part of the energy consumption for utility cost calculation. For example, the transformer is owned by the utility company but it locates in the building. In this case, it might be desired to model transformer energy losses for HVAC operation but the energy losses will not be accounted for utility cost.

\paragraph{Field: Electric Meter 1-10 Name}\label{field-electric-meter-1-10-name}

A transformer may serve different loads such as plug loads, some lighting loads, and some HVAC equipment loads. These fields apply to a PowerInFromGrid type of transformer. The user needs to specify which loads are connected to the transformer. For example the HVAC and Plant equipment might use a higher voltage than the building and only the building loads need power conditioning. This is achieved by providing a list of electric meters wired to the transformer. The input object can currently accommodate up to ten meters, but it is extensible by modifying the Energy+.idd entry. Any valid electric meter name can be used here to wire to the transformer loads. Many different meters are automatically generated by the program and will depend on the objects used throughout the input file. The typical process of determining the exact name to enter in this field involves doing an initial run of EnergyPlus and then examining the *.mdd file which will list the meters and their resulting names. A custom meter is also supported. The meter must have electricity as its resource type.

\paragraph{Transformer Efficiency}\label{transformer-efficiency}

This output field is the efficiency at which the distribution transformer changes alternating current from the higher primary voltage to a lower secondary voltage. The efficiency is calculated for each HVAC system timestep being simulated, and the results are averaged for the timestep being reported.

\paragraph{Transformer Output Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{transformer-output-electric-power-w}

\paragraph{Transformer Output Elecric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{transformer-output-elecric-energy-j}

These outputs are the total electricity power or energy provided by the transformer. They are equal to the metered loads which are wired to the transformer.

\paragraph{Transformer Thermal Loss Rate {[}W{]}}\label{transformer-thermal-loss-rate-w}

\paragraph{Transformer Thermal Loss Energy {[}J{]}}\label{transformer-thermal-loss-energy-j}

These outputs are the total energy losses occurred in the transformer. They are equal to the sum of the no load loss and the load loss. These values are calculated for each HVAC system timestep being simulated, and the results are averaged (for rate) or summed (for energy) for the timestep being reported.

\paragraph{Transformer Distribution Electric Loss Energy {[}J{]}}\label{transformer-distribution-electric-loss-energy-j}

This output is the total energy losses occurred in the transformer when it is used for input power from grid to building. It is set as zero if the transformer is used to transfer energy from onsite power generators to the electricity grid. This output is also added to a meter with ResourceType = Electricity, GroupKey = System.

\paragraph{Transformer Cogeneration Electric Loss Energy {[}J{]}}\label{transformer-cogeneration-electric-loss-energy-j}

This output is the total energy losses occurred in the transformer when it is used for input onsite cogeneration to the grid. It is set as zero if the transformer is used to transfer the electricity grid to building. This output is also added to a meter with ResourceType = ElectricityProduced, EndUseKey = Cogeneration, GroupKey = System.

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution}\label{electricloadcenterdistribution}

ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects are used to include on-site electricity generators and or storage in a simulation. The electric load center dispatches both generators and storage according to operation schemes and tracks and reports the amount of electricity generated and purchased. When using on-site generators, the program provides various reports for the electricity used, generated on site, stored, exported etc. There are two separate operation schemes, one for generators and a second for storage, and they can be different. The generator operation is managed before the storage operation. Facility electrical demand tracking is done by the internal or custom meters used by EnergyPlus for reporting. The thermal demand tracking uses internal load calculations from the plant simulation. The dispatching of different generators is based on expectations based on their nominal/rated electric power output. If the current conditions are such that the generator model determines that generation was higher or lower, then the results of the dispatch may differ from expectations.

Multiple different ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects can be included in an input file. A great deal of flexibility is available by mixing different load centers and operating schemes. If multiple load centers are used, the supervisory control will dispatch generators sequentially across the load centers. Therefore, the order of these input objects in the IDF file becomes important with the generators associated with first load center in the file being the first to be managed. A certain amount of caution is needed to avoid conflicting operating schemes.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-012}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-013}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric load center.

\paragraph{Field: Generator List Name}\label{field-generator-list-name}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the list of generators in the set defined in an ElectricLoadCenter:Generators object. All the generators connected to this load center need to be of the same type in terms of all AC or all DC. Currently the only DC generators are photovoltaic panels, the others are all AC. A facility with both AC and DC generators will need to use seperate ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects. The generator list named here can only be associated with one load center. This field can be left blank if there are no generators.

\paragraph{Field: Generator Operation Scheme Type}\label{field-generator-operation-scheme-type}

This alpha field specifies the type of operating scheme for the generator set. The available operating schemes are Baseload, DemandLimit, TrackElectrical, TrackSchedule, TrackMeter, FollowThermal, and FollowThermalLimitElectrical. The Baseload scheme operates the generators at their rated (requested) electric power output when the generator is scheduled ON (ref. ElectricLoadCenter:Generators). The Baseload scheme requests all generators scheduled ON (available) to operate, even if the amount of electric power generated exceeds the total facility electric power demand. The DemandLimit scheme limits the amount of purchased electrical from the utility to the amount specified in the input object. The DemandLimit scheme tries to have the generators meet all of the demand above the purchased electric limit set by the user in the next field. The TrackElectrical scheme tries to have the generators meet all of the electrical demand for the building. The TrackSchedule scheme tries to have the generators meet all of the electrical demand determined in a user-defined schedule. The TrackMeter scheme tries to have the generators meet all the electrical demand from a meter, which could also be a user-defined custom meter.

The DemandLimit, TrackElectrical, TrackSchedule, and TrackMeter schemes will sequentially load the available generators. All demand not met by available generator capacity (or storage) will be met by purchased electrical. Therefore, if DemandLimit, TrackElectrical, TrackSchedule, or TrackMeter is utilized and the available generators are not enough to meet demand, then purchased electrical will offset the difference. If a generator is needed in the simulation for a small load and it is less than the minimum part load ratio the generator will operate at the minimum part load ratio and the excess will either reduce demand or the excess energy will be available for returning to the electric grid.

The FollowThermal and FollowThermalLimitElectrical schemes are for heat following cogeneration and run the generators to meet the thermal demand. The FollowThermal schemes allow excess electrical generation to be exported to the grid, while the FollowThermalLimitElectrical scheme restricts generator output to a maximum of the building's current electrical demand (so that no electricity is exported). The thermal demand is determined from the plant modeling and depends on the flow requested by other components on the demand side of the plant loop, the loop temperatures, and the loop temperature set point. The electric load center converts the thermal load to an electrical load using a nominal ratio of the thermal to electrical power production for each generator. For these schemes, the generator needs to be connected to the supply side of a plant loop and components that request hot water need to be on the demand side of the plant loop. This is different than the usual configuration for electrical following schemes where the generator is put on the demand side and request flow for the purposes of cooling the generator. Therefore a switch from one of the electrical-based operating schemes to one of the thermal-based operating schemes requires a substantial change in plant topology.

If the load center includes electrical storage, then the choice of generator operating schemes will also affect how storage is managed. The generator operation scheme and dispatch is modeled before the storage operation scheme so that the current generator production is available for use with the storage operation scheme.

\paragraph{Field: Demand Limit Scheme Purchased Electric Demand Limit}\label{field-demand-limit-scheme-purchased-electric-demand-limit}

This numerical field is the user input for the demand limit above which the generators will try and meet the entire electrical load on the building minus the photovoltaic array if available.

\paragraph{Field: Track Schedule Name Scheme Schedule Name}\label{field-track-schedule-name-scheme-schedule-name}

This alpha field is the user input for the name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file that contains values for the demand loads placed on the generator(s). The schedule values should be in Watts.

\paragraph{Field: Track Meter Scheme Meter Name}\label{field-track-meter-scheme-meter-name}

This alpha field is the user input for the name of a meter. Any valid meter name can be used here to control the loads that the generator(s) will try to meet. Many different meters are automatically generated by the program and will depend on the objects used throughout the input file. The typical process of determining the exact name to enter in this field involves doing an initial run of EnergyPlus and then examining the *.rdd file which will list the meters and their resulting names. The *.mtd file will also be useful to understand what exactly is included in a meter. The user can also use the Output:CustomMeter objects to redefine meter names and to control what electrical loads are included on them in a flexible manner.

\paragraph{Field: Electrical Buss Type}\label{field-electrical-buss-type}

This alpha field is used to describe how the electric load center is configured with respect to any power conditioning and/or storage equipment. There are five configurations available for load centers that are selected using one of these keywords: AlternatingCurrent, AlternatingCurrentWithStorage, DirectCurrentWithInverter, DirectCurrentWithInverterDCStorage, or DirectCurrentWithInverterACStorage. This input informs the program which of the five pre-configured arrangements is to be used for this load center. The following diagrams show the kinds of devices and how they are arranged for each of the buss types.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AlternatingCurrent. This type of load center is for adding one or more on-site generators that produce AC power. If the voltage does not match a transformer can be included but is not needed. AlternatingCurrent is the default.

An inverter is needed to convert power from DC to AC and is located between the storage and where the subpanel feeds into the main panel. The connection between the load center and the main building panel is bidirectional so that storage can be charged by drawing from the grid. An AC to DC converter is needed if the storage operation scheme is such that the control might draw power from the main facility panel into the load center in order to charge storage. Transformer is optional.

\paragraph{Field: Inverter Object Name}\label{field-inverter-object-name}

This field is used to identify the inverter connected to this load center (if any). This field is only used if the Electrical Buss Type is set to DirectCurrentWithInverter, DirectCurrentWithInverterDCStorage, or DirectCurrentWithInverterACStorage and should contain the user-defined name of an inverter object. There are three types of inverter models available -see ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:Simple, ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:LookUpTable, ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:FunctionOfPower, or ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:PVWatts. Enter the name of one of these types of inverter objects defined elsewhere in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Electrical Storage Object Name}\label{field-electrical-storage-object-name}

This field is used to identify the electrical storage connected to this load center (if any). This field is only used if the Electrical Buss Type is set to AlternatingCurrentWithStorage, DirectCurrentWithInverterDCStorage or DirectCurrentWithInverterACStorage. Enter the name of an ElectricLoadCenter:Storage:* object defined elsewhere in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Transformer Object Name}\label{field-transformer-object-name}

This field is used to identify the transformer connected to this load center (if any). This field can be used for any electrical buss types. Enter the name of an ElectricLoadCenter:Transformer object defined elsewhere in the input file. The transformer should have use type set to LoadCenterPowerConditioning.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Operation Scheme}\label{field-storage-operation-scheme}

This field is used to select the operation scheme used to govern how storage charge and discharge is controlled. There are four options: TrackFacilityElectricDemandStoreExcessOnSite, TrackMeterDemandStoreExcessOnSite, TrackChargeDischargeSchedules, or FacilityDemandLeveling.

TrackFacilityElectricDemandStoreExcessOnSite indicates that storage control will follow the facility power demand (meter Facility:Electricity) while accounting for any on-site generation. Only excess on site generation gets stored. This is the legacy control behavior before version 8.5 and is the default.

TrackMeterDemandStoreExcessOnSite indicates that storage discharge control will follow an electric meter named in the field called Storage Control Track Meter Name. This scheme is similar TrackFacilityElectricDemandStoreExcessOnSite except that instead of the main facility electric meter, the control is based off of a user-selected meter.

TrackChargeDischargeSchedules indicates that control will follow the charging and discharging power and schedules defined in the fields called Maximum Storage Charge Grid Supply Power, Storage Charge Grid Supply Power Fraction Schedule Name, Design Storage Discharge Grid Export Power, and Storage Discharge Grid Export Fraction Schedule Name.

FacilityDemandLeveling indicates that storage control will attempt to control the facility's power demand drawn from the utility service to a prescribed level. The target utility demand is entered in the fields called Storage Control Utility Demand Limit and Storage Control Utility Demand Limit Fraction Schedule Name. This scheme first accounts for any on-site generation and during times of high use will discharge storage to reduce facility grid demand to meet the target level and during times of low use will charge storage from the grid to increase facility grid demand to meet the target level. This scheme allows controlling the load factor as long as the storage capacity and rates are not limiting what is possible. Negative schedule values can be used so that a negative demand target is exporting power out to the grid.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Control Track Meter Name}\label{field-storage-control-track-meter-name}

This field is the name of a meter to use when a custom meter is to be used. This is required when Storage Operation Scheme is set to TrackMeterDemandStoreExcessOnSite.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Converter Object Name}\label{field-storage-converter-object-name}

This field is the name of an ElectricLoadCenter:Storage:Converter object defined elsewhere in the input file that describes the performance when converting AC to DC when charging DC storage from grid supply. This field is required when using DC storage (buss type DirectCurrentWithInverterDCStorage) with grid supplied charging power (Storage Operation Scheme is set to TrackChargeDischargeSchedules or FacilityDemandLeveling.) Although some inverter devices are bidirectional a separate converter object is needed to describe AC to DC performance.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Storage State of Charge Fraction}\label{field-maximum-storage-state-of-charge-fraction}

This numeric field specifies the fraction of storage capacity used as an upper limit for controlling charging. Charging will be constrained so that charging will stop the once this limit is reached. This fraction is the state of charge of the storage device where 1.0 is completely full and 0.0 is completely empty. This allows supervisory control over charging to model behavior intended to protect the battery from damage. The legacy behavior prior to version 8.5 was to charge to full capacity and therefore the default is 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Storage State of Charge Fraction}\label{field-minimum-storage-state-of-charge-fraction}

This numeric field specifies the fraction of storage capacity used as lower limit for controlling discharging. Discharging will be constrained so that discharging will stop once this limit is reached. This fraction is the state of charge of the storage device where 1.0 is completely full and 0.0 is completely empty. This allows supervisory control over discharging to model behavior intended to protect the battery from damage. The legacy behavior prior to version 8.5 was to discharge to empty and therefore the default is 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Design Storage Control Charge Power}\label{field-design-storage-control-charge-power}

This field is the design maximum rate that electric power can be charged into storage, in Watts. This field is used as an upper limit for most storage control operation schemes. However for TrackChargeDischargeSchedules, this is the design value for how much power to use when charging and it is multipled by the power fraction schedule in the next field. Required field when using Storage Operation Schemes set to FacilityDemandLeveling or TrackChargeDischargeSchedules.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Charge Power Fraction Schedule Name}\label{field-storage-charge-power-fraction-schedule-name}

This field contains the name of a schedule that controls the timing and magnitude of charging storage. This is a required field if Storage Operation Scheme is set to TrackChargeDischargeSchedules. Schedule values should be fractions from 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive. This schedule will need to be coordinated with the discharging schedule named below.

\paragraph{Field: Design Storage Control Discharge Power}\label{field-design-storage-control-discharge-power}

This field is the design maximum rate that electric power can be discharged from storage. This field is used as an upper limit for most storage control operation schemes. However for TrackChargeDischargeSchedules, this is the design value for how much power to draw when discharging and it is multiplied by the power fraction schedule in the next field. Required field when using Storage Operation Schemes set to FacilityDemandLeveling or TrackChargeDischargeSchedules.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Discharge Power Fraction Schedule Name}\label{field-storage-discharge-power-fraction-schedule-name}

This field contains the name of a schedule that controls the timing and magnitude of discharging storage. Required field if Storage Operation Scheme is set to TrackChargeDischargeSchedules. Schedule values should be fractions from 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive. This schedule will need to be coordinated with the charging schedule named above.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Control Utility Demand Target}\label{field-storage-control-utility-demand-target}

This field contains the design demand target in Watts. This field is used when the storage operation scheme is set to FacilityDemandLeveling. This becomes the target utility service demand power for discharge control. This design value is multiplied by the fraction schedule named in the next field. This is more than an upper limit, it is also going to call for extra electric power to raise demand up to the target and put the extra power into on-site storage. This field is required for FacilityDemandLimit storage operation scheme.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Control Utility Demand Target Fraction Schedule Name}\label{field-storage-control-utility-demand-target-fraction-schedule-name}

This field is the name of schedule that modifies the utility demand power target over time. Schedule values should be fractions from -1.0 to 1.0, inclusive. Negative values indicate export to grid. This field is required if Storage Operation Scheme is set to FacilityDemandLeveling.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-1-008}

There are three levels of results reporting related to electric load centers and generators. The top level of reporting provides results across the whole building and all the different electric load centers and generators. The second level of reporting provides results for individual load centers. The third level is for each type of generator (see individual generator descriptions). This section discusses the first two levels.

Even if no ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution object is included, the following whole-building summary output variables are also available for all simulations that have any electricity consuming equipment.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  HVAC,Average,Facility Total Purchased Electric Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Facility Total Purchased Electric Energy {[}J{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Facility Total Surplus Electric Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Facility Total Surplus Electric Energy {[}J{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Facility Net Purchased Electric Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Facility Net Purchased Electric Energy {[}J{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Facility Total Building Electric Demand Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Facility Total HVAC Electric Demand Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Facility Total Electric Demand Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Facility Total Produced Electric Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Facility Total Produced Electric Energy {[}J{]}
\end{itemize}

These output variables all use a default keyword Whole Building.

\paragraph{Facility Total Purchased Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{facility-total-purchased-electric-power-w}

\paragraph{Facility Total Purchased Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{facility-total-purchased-electric-energy-j}

These outputs are the total of electricity purchased for the entire facility in both power and energy units. This value is always positive and indicates the amount of energy that is purchased from the utility.

\paragraph{Facility Total Surplus Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{facility-total-surplus-electric-power-w}

\paragraph{Facility Total Surplus Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{facility-total-surplus-electric-energy-j}

These outputs are the total excess electricity exported and sent out to the electrical grid in both power and energy units. This value is always positive and indicates the surplus electric power (from generation and/or storage discharge) exceeds the whole-building demand and electricity is being fed from the facility into the grid.

\paragraph{Facility Net Purchased Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{facility-net-purchased-electric-power-w}

\paragraph{Facility Net Purchased Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{facility-net-purchased-electric-energy-j}

These outputs are the net electricity purchased in both Power and Energy units. This value can be either positive or negative. Positive values are defined as electricity purchased from the utility. Negative values are defined as surplus electricity fed back into the grid.

\paragraph{Facility Total Building Electric Demand Power {[}W{]}}\label{facility-total-building-electric-demand-power-w}

This output variable includes all of the electric demand from the building (non-HVAC) portion of the simulation, which would contain lights, electrical equipment, exterior lights and equipment, etc.

\paragraph{Facility Total HVAC Electric Demand Power {[}W{]}}\label{facility-total-hvac-electric-demand-power-w}

This output variable includes all of the electric demand from the HVAC portion of the simulation, which would contain fans, electric coils, pumps, chillers, cooling towers, etc.

\paragraph{Facility Total Electric Demand Power {[}W{]}}\label{facility-total-electric-demand-power-w}

This is the total of the whole Building and HVAC electric demands.

\paragraph{Facility Total Produced Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{facility-total-produced-electric-power-w}

\paragraph{Facility Total Produced Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{facility-total-produced-electric-energy-j}

These outputs are the total generator and photovoltaic electricity produced on-site for the entire model, and they are in both Power and Energy units. When the electric power production system includes power conversion devices including DC to AC inverters, AC to DC converters, or transformers, the power conversion losses are included as negative values in these reports. When electrical storage is used with on-site production, the electricity put into storage is decremented from production and the electricity removed storage is added to production. This means that losses from a round trip through electrical storage decrease on-site electricity production.

Each ElectricLoadCenter also collects results from the individual generators that are connected to that load center. The keywords for these reports are the unique names of ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects. The output variables available at the ElectricLoadCenter level are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  HVAC,Average,Electric Load Center Produced Electric Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Electric Load Center Produced Electric Energy {[}J{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Electric Load Center Supplied Electric Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Electric Load Center Drawn Electric Power {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Electric Load Center Produced Thermal Rate {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Electric Load Center Produced Thermal Energy {[}J{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Electric Load Center Requested Electric Power {[}W{]}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Electric Load Center Produced Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{electric-load-center-produced-electric-power-w}

\paragraph{Electric Load Center Produced Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{electric-load-center-produced-electric-energy-j}

These outputs are the sum of electrical energy and power produced by the generators attached to a particular load center. This could be DC or AC depending on the type of buss. The power actually delivered by the load center may be adjusted by power conversion losses from an inverter or transformer or by interaction with the any electrical storage.

\paragraph{Electric Load Center Supplied Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{electric-load-center-supplied-electric-power-w}

This output is the power fed from the electric load center into the main distribution panel, in Watts. This power is generated or discharged by on site equipment and has been adjusted to account for any power conversion by an inverter and/or transformer on the load center.

\paragraph{Electric Load Center Drawn Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{electric-load-center-drawn-electric-power-w}

This output is the power fed from the main distribution panel into the load center, in Watts. This power draw is typically only for charging storage with power from either the grid or another load center.

\paragraph{Electric Load Center Produced Thermal Rate {[}W{]}}\label{electric-load-center-produced-thermal-rate-w}

\paragraph{Electric Load Center Produced Thermal Energy {[}J{]}}\label{electric-load-center-produced-thermal-energy-j}

These outputs are the sum of the thermal energy and power produced by the generators attached to a particular load center. The keywords for these reports are the unique names of ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects.

\paragraph{Electric Load Center Requested Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{electric-load-center-requested-electric-power-w}

This output variable is the average electric power supply (in watts) requested of the load center by the facility's main distribution panel, for the time step being reported. This is used by the load center generator and storage operation control logic when determining how to run the generators and/or storage devices. For the baseload generator operating scheme, this output variable should equal the sum of the power supply requests for the available generators associated with this load center (ref. ElectricLoadCenter:Generators). In other cases, this output could be different from the sum of the power supply requests for the generators associated with this load center. For example, a generator might be requested to provide a certain amount of power but can only provide a fraction of the requested amount. In this case the load center will detect this shortfall and include it when calculating the power request for the next available generator. Therefore, the sum of the power supply requests for the individual generators associated with this load center (ref. ElectricLoadCenter:Generators) could be greater than the Electric Load Center Requested Electric Power output variable.

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Generators}\label{electricloadcentergenerators}

The ElectricLoadCenter:Generators object is used to provide a list of the generators to include in the simulation. The list includes the names and types of all the generators along with separate availability schedules, the rated power output, and thermal-to-electrical power ratio for each. Sets of five input fields are repeated for each generator. If more than 30 generators are needed, EnergyPlus will auto-extend to suit the needs but other interfaces (such as the IDF Editor may not). The user can always modify the Energy+.idd file to accommodate the extra fields necessary, but it is likely the next release of EnergyPlus will overwrite any user modifications.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-011}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-011}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the generators in the set.

\paragraph{FieldSet: Name, Object Type, Rated Power Output, Availability, Thermal Ratio up to 30}\label{fieldset-name-object-type-rated-power-output-availability-thermal-ratio-up-to-30}

Each generator is specified by a set of 5 input fields that contain an identifying name, a keyword that indicates the type of generator, the rated output of the generator, the availability schedule of the generator, and the thermal to electrical power production ratio.

\paragraph{Field: Generator \textless{}x\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-generator-x-name}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the first generator in the list.

\paragraph{Field: Generator \textless{}x\textgreater{} Object Type}\label{field-generator-x-object-type}

This alpha field contains the keyword for the type of generator. The available types include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Generator:InternalCombustionEngine
\item
  Generator:CombustionTurbine
\item
  Generator:Photovoltaic
\item
  Generator:PVWatts
\item
  Generator:FuelCell
\item
  Generator:MicroCHP
\item
  Generator:MicroTurbine
\item
  Generator:WindTurbine
\end{itemize}

These keywords are the names of the input objects for the type of generator.

\paragraph{Field: Generator \textless{}x\textgreater{} Rated Electric Power Output}\label{field-generator-x-rated-electric-power-output}

This numeric field contains the nominal electric power output to be requested from generator 1. It is normally equal to the rated power output of the generator in Watts. This value is used only for supervisory control and generator dispatch; the actual power output for each time step is determined by the generator models. This value affects how much a generator is loaded (i.e., requested electric power output) and can also impact the operation of an electric storage unit (e.g., LoadCenter:Storage:Simple) if one is connected to the associated load distribution center (ref. ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution). Refer to Electrical Storage in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for more details regarding this input field and its relationship with electric storage.

\paragraph{Field: Generator \textless{}x\textgreater{} Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-generator-x-availability-schedule-name}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the generator availability schedule. If not blank, this field must contain the name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file. A schedule value of \textless{} = 0.0 indicates the generator is not available, while a schedule value \textgreater{} 0.0 indicates that the generator is available to operate. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Generator \textless{}x\textgreater{} Rated Thermal to Electrical Power Ratio}\label{field-generator-x-rated-thermal-to-electrical-power-ratio}

This numeric field contains the ratio of the rated thermal output to the rated electric output. It is required and used if the operation scheme is set to \textbf{FollowThermal} or \textbf{FollowThermalLimitElectrical}. This nominal ratio is only used for control and dispatch decisions. This value should be generally consistent with the more detailed performance input for the individual generator component models but it is not used in those component models.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-2-007}

A single output variable is available for each generator specified via this object as described below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  HVAC,Average,Generator Requested Electric Power {[}W{]}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Generator Requested Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{generator-requested-electric-power-w}

This output variable represents the average electric power supply in Watts that is being requested by the generator operation scheme from a specific generator for the time step being reported. In some instances the output value may be the Rated Electric Power Output specified for the generator in the ElectricLoadCenter:Generators object. If the generator is not available for a simulation time step (as indicated by its availability schedule), then the power supply request will be zero. The power supply request may be less than the rated electric power output if the overall electric power reduction target has already been met, partially or completely, by electric power produced by other generators. If an EnergyPlus Energy Management System is used to specify an electric power supply request for this generator, then that EMS request will be reflected in this output variable.

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:Simple}\label{electricloadcenterinvertersimple}

This input object is used to model conversion from Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) in an electric load center that contains photovoltaic modules. Such a load center has an array of photovoltaic modules that feed an inverter DC power and the inverter produces AC power. This input object is for the simplest inverter model and uses a fixed efficiency. There are two other types of inverters with more complex models described below.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-3-010}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-2-010}

This field contains a unique name for the inverter. The name entered must also be unique across all other types of inverters that may also be in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-1-003}

This field contains the name of a schedule that describes when the inverter is available. If the inverter is scheduled to not be available, by scheduling a value of 0, then it cannot produce AC power and will not consume ancillary power during standby. Any non-zero schedule value means the inverter is available to produce AC power and consume ancillary power during standby. If the Inverter is scheduled to be unavailable but it is being supplied with DC power anyway, then the energy is dissipated as heat. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-1-003}

This field contains the name of the thermal zone where the inverter is located. Entering a valid name of zone here will direct EnergyPlus to include the inverter s losses as heat gains to the named thermal zone. If the inverter is not within a thermal zone, then this field can be left blank (and the thermal energy associated with inverter losses is removed from the building model).

\paragraph{Field: Radiative Fraction}\label{field-radiative-fraction-1}

This field contains the fraction of inverter thermal losses that enter the zone as long-wave thermal radiation. This should be a factor between 0.0 and 1.0. The balance of the losses is convective. This field is not used if the previous field for zone name is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Inverter Efficiency}\label{field-inverter-efficiency}

This field contains the value for inverter efficiency. In the simple model, efficiency is a constant. This is the so-called 1-term model. Input data for different types of inverters is available at \url{http://www.gosolarcalifornia.org/equipment/inverter_tests/summaries} where the CEC Efficiency would be the value to enter here.

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:FunctionOfPower}\label{electricloadcenterinverterfunctionofpower}

This input object is used to model conversion from Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) in an electric load center that contains photovoltaic modules. Such a load center has an array of photovoltaic modules that feed an inverter DC power and the inverter produces AC power. This input object is for an inverter model where efficiency is a function of normalized power.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-4-009}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-3-009}

This field contains a unique name for the inverter. The name entered must also be unique across all other types of inverters that may also be in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-2-001}

This field contains the name of a schedule that describes when the inverter is available. If the inverter is scheduled to not be available, by scheduling a value of 0, then it cannot produce AC power, nor contribute heat gains to the zone, and will not consume ancillary power during standby. Any non-zero schedule value means the inverter is available to produce AC power, contribute heat gains to the zone and consume ancillary power during standby. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-2-001}

This field contains the name of the thermal zone where the inverter is located. Entering a valid name of zone here will direct EnergyPlus to include the inverter s losses as heat gains to the named thermal zone. If the inverter is not within a thermal zone, then this field can be left blank (and the thermal energy associated with inverter losses is removed from the building model).

\paragraph{Field: Radiative Fraction}\label{field-radiative-fraction-2}

This field contains the fraction of inverter thermal losses that enter the zone as long-wave thermal radiation. This should be a factor between 0.0 and 1.0. The balance of the losses is convective. This field is not used if the previous field for zone name is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Efficiency Function of Power Curve Name}\label{field-efficiency-function-of-power-curve-name}

This field contains the name of curve representing the relationship between DC power input into the inverter and the efficiency with which that power is converted to AC. The curve can be either a Curve:Linear, Curve:Quadratic, or Curve:Cubic. The curve s x value is DC power input normalized by the following field. The result of the curve should be power conversion efficiency expressed as a fraction between 0.0 and 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Maximum Continuous Input Power}\label{field-rated-maximum-continuous-input-power}

This field contains the rated power input in watts. This is value used to normalize input power for use with the curve named in the previous field. This is DC power from the PV arrays going into the inverter.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Efficiency}\label{field-minimum-efficiency}

This field contains a minimum bound on the inverter efficiency. This value will be used as a limit on the curve s result.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Efficiency}\label{field-maximum-efficiency}

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:LookUpTable}\label{electricloadcenterinverterlookuptable}

This input object is used to model conversion from Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) in an electric load center that contains photovoltaic modules. Such a load center has an array of photovoltaic modules that feed an inverter DC power and the inverter produces AC power. This input object is for an inverter model where efficiency is interpolated using a look up table.

This object was designed for use with data contained in the Inverter Performance Test Summaries available at \url{http://www.gosolarcalifornia.org/equipment/inverter_tests/summaries}. All of the data needed for this object can be found there by make and model of inverter. The core of the data set is a 3x6 matrix of efficiency at different voltage and power levels. These form the look up table used in the model. Note that EnergyPlus PV models currently model only power and not the voltage and current situation. Therefore, only the nominal voltage data are used. This is the middle row of data in the Go Solar summaries.

If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-3-000}

Entering a valid name of zone here will direct EnergyPlus to include the inverter s losses as heat gains to the named thermal zone. If the inverter is not within a thermal zone, then this field can be left blank (and the thermal energy associated with inverter losses is removed from the building model).

\paragraph{Field: Radiative Fraction}\label{field-radiative-fraction-3}

This field contains the fraction of inverter thermal losses that enter the zone as long-wave thermal radiation. This should be a factor between 0.0 and 1.0. The balance of the losses is convective. This field is not used if the previous field for zone name is left blank.

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:PVWatts}\label{electricloadcenterinverterpvwatts}

The ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:PVWatts is intended to be used in an \hyperref[electricloadcenterdistribution]{ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution} with one or more \hyperref[generatorpvwatts]{Generator:PVWatts} objects. It is \textbf{not} compatible with other Generator objects, such as \hyperref[generatorphotovoltaic-000]{Generator:Photovoltaic}. 

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-electricloadcenterinverterpvwatts}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-electricloadcenterinverterpvwatts}

This field contains a unique name for the inverter. The name entered
must also be unique across all other types of inverters that may also be
in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: DC to AC Size ratio}\label{field-dc-to-ac-size-ratio-electricloadcenterinverterpvwatts}

The DC to AC size ratio is the ratio of the inverter's AC rated size to
the array's DC rated size. Increasing the ratio increases the system's
output over the year, but also increases the array's cost. The default
value is 1.10, which means that a 4 kW system size would be for an array
with a 4 DC kW nameplate size at standard test conditions (STC) and an
inverter with a 3.63 AC kW nameplate size.

For a system with a high DC to AC size ratio, during times when the
array's DC power output exceeds the inverter's rated DC input size, the
inverter limits the array's power output by increasing the DC operating
voltage, which moves the array's operating point down its
current-voltage (I-V) curve. PVWatts models this effect by limiting the
inverter's power output to its rated AC size.

The default value of 1.10 is reasonable for most systems. A typical
range is 1.10 to 1.25, although some large-scale systems have ratios of
as high as 1.50. The optimal value depends on the system's location,
array orientation, and module cost.

Default: 1.10

\paragraph{Field: Inverter Efficiency}\label{field-inverter-efficiency-electricloadcenterinverterpvwatts}

The inverter's nominal rated DC-to-AC conversion efficiency, defined as
the inverter's rated AC power output divided by its rated DC power
output.

Default: 0.96

\paragraph{Inverter DC Input Elecric Power {[}W{]}}\label{inverter-dc-input-elecric-power-w}

\paragraph{Inverter DC Input Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{inverter-dc-input-electric-energy-j}

These outputs are total electricity power or energy fed into the inverter. This is Direct Current from photovoltaics (or DC-based electrical storage) going into the inverter.

\paragraph{Inverter AC Output Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{inverter-ac-output-electric-power-w}

\paragraph{Inverter AC Output Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{inverter-ac-output-electric-energy-j}

These ancillary power draws generally occur when the inverter is not generating power but waiting in a standby mode ready to begin generating power.

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Storage:Converter}\label{electricloadcenterstorageconverter}

This model is for converting AC to DC for grid-supplied charging of DC storage. The model is only for power conversion and does not consider voltage. There are two methods available for determining the efficiency with which power is converted. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of DC power output divided by AC power input. If the name of a zone is entered the power conversion losses will be added to the zone as internal heat gains. The converter is part of a single electric load center.

\subsubsection{Field: Name}\label{field-name-5-007}

This field contains a unique name for the AC to DC converter. This name will be referenced in an ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution object.

\subsubsection{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-4-001}

This field contains the name of a schedule that describes when the power converter is available. If power conversion is not available then electric power from the grid cannot be used to charge storage. Any non-zero value means the converter is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods and the converter is always available. Standby power consumption is on when converter is available and off when the converter is not available.

\subsubsection{Field: Power Conversion Efficiency Method}\label{field-power-conversion-efficiency-method}

This choice field is used to select which method is used to define the efficiency with which power is converted from AC to DC. There are two options: SimpleFixed or FunctionOfPower. - SimpleFixed indicates that power conversion efficiency is a constant with the value set in the next field. There is no need to size the converter (with a value in the field called Design Maximum Continuous Input Power) and varying levels of power do not affect the efficiency. SimpleFixed is the default. - FunctionOfPower indicates that the power conversion efficiency is a function of the level of power being converted. This method is intended to model the characteristic that converters tend to operate less efficiently when loaded well below their design size. The converter must be sized with a value in the Design Maximum Continuous Input Power and the functional relationship described in a performance curve or look-up table.

\subsubsection{Field: Simple Fixed Efficiency}\label{field-simple-fixed-efficiency}

This numeric field is used to set a constant efficiency for conversion of AC to DC at all power levels. This field is only used, and is required, when the Power Conversion Efficiency Method is set to SimpleFixed. The value must be greater than 0.0 and less than equal to 1.0. The default is 0.95.

\subsubsection{Field: Design Maximum Continuous Input Power}\label{field-design-maximum-continuous-input-power}

This numeric field describes the size of the power converter in terms of its design input power level, in Watts. This is the AC power going into the converter. This field is only used, and is required, when the the Power Conversion Efficiency Method is set to FunctionOfPower. This input serves as an upper limit for the AC power input and is used to normalize power for use in the performance curve or table. The AC power being converted at any given time is divided by the value in this field.

\subsubsection{Field: Efficiency Function of Power Curve Name}\label{field-efficiency-function-of-power-curve-name-1}

This field is the name of a performance curve or table object that describes how efficiency varies as a function of normalized power. The single independent ``x'' variable input for the curve or table is the ratio of AC input power at a given time divided by design power in the previous field. The result of the curve should be the power conversion efficiency for that normalized power so that DC power output is the product of efficiency multiplied by the AC power input. Any of the single-variable performance curves or lookup table objects can be used to describe performance. This field is only used, and is required, when the the Power Conversion Efficiency Method is set to FunctionOfPower.

\subsubsection{Field: Ancillary Power Consumed In Standby}\label{field-ancillary-power-consumed-in-standby-1}

This numeric field describes the ancillary power consumed by the converter when it is available but not converting power, in Watts. This field is optional and can be used with any of the efficiency methods. If this converter is really on mode of a bidirectional inverter, take care not to double count the ancillary consumption by including them in both this component and the inverter component.

\subsubsection{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-4-000}

This field is the name of thermal zone where the converter is located. If this field is omitted then the converter is considered outdoors. The power lost during the conversion process is treated as heat gains and added the thermal zone named in this field. The split between radiation and convection can be controlled in the next input field.

\subsubsection{Field: Radiative Fraction}\label{field-zone-rad-fract}

This numeric field is the fraction of zone heat gains that are handled as infrared thermal radiation. This field is only used if a zone is named in the previous field. The portion of zone gains that are not radiative are added to the zone as convection. If a zone is named and this field left blank or omitted then all the zone heat gains will be convective.

\subsection{ElectricLoadCenter:Storage:Battery}\label{electricloadcenterstorage-battery}

This object uses the kinetic battery model (KiBaM) to simulate rechargeable battery banks in an electrical load center. This model is intended to represent technologies such as lead-acid that encounter significant rate or kinetic limitations. The battery bank is a collection of one or more individual battery modules. Given the surplus or deficit power from the electrical system and the state of charge from the previous time step, this object can model the voltage, current, and energy losses with charging and discharging during each time step. The cumulative battery damage can be also modeled and reported at the end of each simulation run.

The kinetic battery model assumes that part of the battery s energy storage capacity is immediately available in discharging or charging while the rest is chemically bound. As a function of constant current, the battery capacity is related to three parameters: the maximum capacity at infinitesimal current, the capacity ratio of available charges, and the conversion ratio between available charges and bound charges. These parameters are usually obtained via curve fitting based on battery data sheets or test data.

Each individual battery module is modeled as a voltage source in series with an electrical resistance. KiBaM assumes that the internal resistance is constant and the open circuit voltage varies with the electric current, the state of charge and the operation mode (charging or discharging). For an individual battery module, the open circuit voltage at any time is correlated to the voltage at fully charged/discharged state and three other regression coefficients. These regression coefficients are usually obtained via curve fitting based on battery test data.

The object offers user the option to perform battery life calculation. If battery life is modeled, the user needs to provide a group of coefficients for the correlation between the number of cycles for battery failure and the corresponding cycle range. More detailed information can be found from the Engineering Reference.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Recovery Maximum Temperature}\label{field-heat-recovery-maximum-temperature}

This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.

As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.

The temperature is specified in degrees C.

\subsection{Generator:CombustionTurbine}\label{generatorcombustionturbine}

EnergyPlus has two different models for combustion turbine style generators. This one stems for a model that was originally in the BLAST computer program. A newer model with a different formulation is also available -see the Generator:MicroTurbine input object. The basic combustion-turbine cycle is the Brayton Cycle or open cycle, which consists of an adiabatic compression, constant pressure heating, and adiabatic expansion. The Combustion turbine model uses the electrical load and engine generator size to compute part-load ratios (PLR). Fuel energy input and recoverable lube oil heat are then computed. Finally, the recoverable exhaust heat is calculated.

Combustion turbine generators use performance parameters to compute fuel energy consumption as a function of part-load and ambient (entering) air temperature. Recoverable fuel energy equipment, recoverable lube oil heat/fuel energy input equipment performance, total exhaust heat/fuel energy input equipment, exhaust gas temperature/fuel energy input equipment performance parameters are all specified with a quadratic curve fit.

When the heat recovery curve fits = 0.0, this means that no heat recovery is done on the diesel generator exhaust gas; and no heat recovery is specified.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-8-005}

\paragraph{Field: Heat Recovery Lube Energy Curve Name}\label{field-heat-recovery-lube-energy-curve-name}

This alpha field contains the name of the Recovery Lube Heat curve. The curve itself is specified separately using a curve object (see Curve:Quadlinear object). The Recovery Lubricant Heat Curve is a quadratic equation that determines the ratio of recovery lube heat to fuel energy. Used to calculate the recoverable lube oil heat as a function of part-load ratio. The defining equation is:

\begin{equation}
RecoveryLubeHeatToFuelRatio = {C_1} + {C_2}RL + {C_3}R{L^2}
\end{equation}

where RL is the Ratio of Load to Rated Power Output.

\paragraph{U-Factor Times Area (UA) Curve}\label{u-factor-times-area-ua-curve-1}

The UA curve applies to the exhaust gas heat exchanger. The curve is an equation that determines the overall heat transfer coefficient for the exhaust gases with the stack. The heat transfer coefficient ultimately helps determine the exhaust stack temperature. The defining equation is:

\begin{equation}
UAToCapacityRatio = {C_1}GeneratorRatedPowerOutpu{t^{{C_2}}}
\end{equation}

This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the generator uses. Valid choices are: \textbf{NaturalGas, PropaneGas, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, OtherFuel1} and \textbf{OtherFuel2}. The default is \textbf{NaturalGas}.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Recovery Maximum Temperature}\label{field-heat-recovery-maximum-temperature-1}

This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.

As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.

The temperature is specified in degrees C.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-outdoor-air-inlet-node-name-001}

This field is optional. It is used to explicitly define an outdoor air node for the inlet for combustion air stream. Defining an outdoor air node here allows using the height-dependent model for outdoor air conditions.

\subsection{Generator:MicroTurbine}\label{generatormicroturbine}

MicroTurbine generators are small combustion turbines that produce electricity on a relatively small scale (e.g., 25kW to 500kW). This model uses nominal performance at reference conditions along with several modifier curves to determine electrical power output and fuel use at non-reference conditions. Standby and ancillary power can also be taken into account. Furthermore, energy recovery from exhaust air can be used to heat water. Similar to electrical power output, thermal power (heat recovery) output is calculated using nominal performance at reference conditions with modifier curves to account for variations at non-reference conditions.

The following inputs define the MicroTurbine electric generator. The ElectricLoadCenter:Generators and ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects are used to define the availability and control of all electric generators included in the simulation (ref.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the Reference Electrical Power Output to give the full-load power output at a specific combustion air inlet temperature and elevation (i.e., at values different from the reference conditions). This curve should be normalized to have a value of 1.0 at the reference conditions, and the curve should be valid for the range of inlet air temperatures anticipated for the simulation period and for the actual elevation of the generator.

This alpha field specifies the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical efficiency as a function of the combustion air inlet temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the Reference Electrical Efficiency Using Lower Heating Value to give the full-load electrical efficiency at specific combustion air inlet temperatures (i.e., at inlet air temperatures different from the Reference Combustion Air Inlet Temperature).

The ancillary power is the electrical power consumed by other associated equipment (e.g., external fuel pressurization pumps) when the generator is operating. Specify this input as 0.0 if the Reference Electrical Power Output and Reference Electrical Efficiency Using Lower Heating Value input fields and associated modifier curves reflect the net electrical power output from the generator (i.e., ancillary power already deducted from the generator s gross electrical power output). A value greater than zero indicates that this electrical power is consumed whenever the generator is operating and will be deducted from the generator s overall electrical power output (Generator Produced Electric Power). The value specified for this field must be greater than or equal to zero. If this field is left blank, the default value of 0.0 W will be used.

\paragraph{Field: Ancillary Power Function of Fuel Input Curve Name}\label{field-ancillary-power-function-of-fuel-input-curve-name}

In this case, the generator will request the Reference Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate whenever it operates but the actual flow rate may be limited by other plant components (e.g., pump). The InternalControl option indicates the flow of water is controlled inside the generator based on current operating conditions. For InternalControl, the generator should (probably) include a bypass branch when connecting to the plant loop.

This curve should be normalized to have a value of 1.0 at the reference conditions, and the curve should be valid for the range of inlet water temperatures and net electrical power output anticipated for the simulation period.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the steady-state heat recovery at the current combustion inlet air temperature and elevation to give the heat recovery rate (thermal power output) at specific part-load operating conditions. This curve should be normalized to have a value of 1.0 when the generator s part-load ratio is 1.0, and the curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation period.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the steady-state heat recovery at the current combustion inlet air temperature and elevation to give the heat recovery rate (thermal power output) at non-reference inlet water conditions. This curve should be normalized to have a value of 1.0 at the Reference Inlet Water Temperature, and the curve should be valid for the range of inlet water temperatures anticipated for the simulation period. If this field is left blank, the model assumes that the modifier curve is 1.0 for the entire simulation.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Recovery Rate Function of Water Flow Rate Curve Name}\label{field-heat-recovery-rate-function-of-water-flow-rate-curve-name}

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-heat-recovery-water-flow-rate}

This numeric field specifies the maximum (volumetric) water flow rate through the heat recovery heat exchanger in cubic meters per second. The minimum input value for this field is 0.0, and a value of 0.0 is assumed if this field is left blank. The maximum heat recovery water flow rate must be greater than or equal to the minimum heat recovery water flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Heat Recovery Water Temperature}\label{field-maximum-heat-recovery-water-temperature}

This field sets the maximum water temperature, in degrees Celsius, that this generator can produce via heat recovery. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.

As temperatures in the water loop approach this maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in generator s heat recovery heat exchanger becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field.

The model was developed for both internal combustion and Stirling cycle engines, but might be used for other types of residential CHP devices.

Note that unlike other component models in EnergyPlus, this model is not normalized. Therefore, performance coefficients developed for one type and capacity of CHP device cannot be used for a device with a different capacity.

This model is an empirical, curve fit model. This object describes the connections to the rest of the building model and includes a reference to another object called Generator:MicroCHP:NonNormalizedParameters that provides the operating characteristics.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-7-000}

This field contains the name of the thermal zone where the CHP device is located in the model. If the device is outdoors, or you do not want skin losses to be added to a zone, then leave this field blank.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Water Inlet Node Name}\label{field-cooling-water-inlet-node-name}

This field contains the name of a schedule used to control whether or not the unit is available. It is available any time the value is greater than zero. If it is available, it may consume standby power at times when there is no request for power from the Electric Load Center. If it is not available (schedule value = 0.0) then the CHP unit is in a completely off mode and will not consume standby power. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Warm Up Mode}\label{field-warm-up-mode}

This field is used to choose between different modes of controlling the warm up characteristics. Residential CHP units such as Stirling engines have different warm up characteristics than internal combustion engines. There are two warm up modes available: NominalEngineTemperature or TimeDelay. If the former mode is input in this field, then the next three fields are used to model warm up. If the later mode is input, then the fourth field below is used to model warm up.

\paragraph{Field: Warm Up Fuel Flow Rate Coefficient}\label{field-warm-up-fuel-flow-rate-coefficient}

This field describes the value for the coefficient used to determine the rate of fuel flow during warm up. The coefficient, \emph{k\(_{f}\)}, is used in the following relation,

This field is used to describe a limit to the fuel flow rate during warm up. The limit is a ratio multiplied by the maximum fuel flow rate during normal operation (corresponding to the fuel flow for maximum electrical power). If the warm up operating fuel flow rate is twice the steady state fuel flow at maximum power, then a value of 2.0 would be entered in this field. This field is only used with the nominal engine temperature warm up mode and is intended for Stirling engines.

The former is used to direct the model to complete the entire cool down period before the generator can subsequently enter warm up mode. The latter directs the model to allow immediately switching to warm up mode, if power is requested before the cool down period is completed.

\subsection{Generator:FuelCell}\label{generatorfuelcell}

This object is used to model small Fuel Cell (FC) generators. IEA/ECBCS Annex 42 see www.cogen-sim.net, developed the FC model implemented in EnergyPlus. The model can be used for two general types of fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Warning! This is a complicated model, intended primarily for research. Because fuel cells for cogeneration (producing both heat and electricity) are not yet a mature product for building systems, the input data for this model are extremely difficult to obtain. However, the model is designed to allow investigating the relative implications of a broad array of subsystems and interactions with the building.

There should be one Generator:FuelCell object for each individual FC generator in the model. Multiple fuel cell generators can be included in a given simulation. Because there are a large number of inputs to the FC model and numerous, somewhat separable subsystems within a fuel cell, the EnergyPlus input objects have been organized into a number of separate input objects. This object simply refers to the names of all the other input objects that provide the input details for individual subsystems within the fuel cell cogeneration device. The following figure diagrams these separate subsystems. (not shown is an optional stack cooler with separate connections to heat recovery water loop and surrounding zone air).

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 152

\caption{Fuel cell subsystems. \protect \label{fig:fuel-cell-subsystems.}}
\end{figure}

Note that the FC model is formulated using the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, whereas most other parts of EnergyPlus use the Higher Heating Value (HHV). LHV has important advantages over HHV in the context of the quality of heat recovered. While model coefficients for input performance descriptions are to be based on LHV, energy consumption and tariff calculations are also reported on HHV basis when using this model.

If the model has multiple FC generators that are of the exact same type, then only one of these objects is needed and all the Generator:FuelCell can reference it. The model uses a number of curves to describe operating performance. Input data for specific models of FC are not yet available but will be produced by IEA Annex 42 and should be available in the future.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-13-003}

This field contains a unique name for the fuel cell power module subsystem.

\paragraph{Field: Efficiency Curve Mode}\label{field-efficiency-curve-mode}

This field is used to choose between different modes of inputting the electrical efficiency curve. There are two options available for this Field: Annex42 and Normalized . The Annex42 option indicates that the efficiency curves are not normalized and are used for the single size and type of FC product. The Normalized option indicates that the efficiency curves are normalized (as is standard practice in EnergyPlus) relative to a single rating point. In the Annex42 mode, the curves directly represent efficiency as a function of fuel use, but in the Normalized mode, the curves represent an efficiency modification that is applied to the efficiency at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Efficiency Curve Name}\label{field-efficiency-curve-name}

This field contains the name of a Curve:Quadratic input object described elsewhere in the input file. The curve is a function of the net DC electric power, \({P_{el}}\) (W), produced by the power module and describes either the electrical efficiency or the how the efficiency is modified depending on the mode selected in the previous field. This quadratic curve is just one part of the entire parametric relation used to describe electrical efficiency \({\varepsilon_{el}}\) . For the Annex42 mode the full relation for efficiency is,

\begin{equation}
{\varepsilon_{el}} = \left[ {{\varepsilon_0} + {\varepsilon_1} \cdot {P_{el}} + {\varepsilon_2} \cdot P_{el}^2} \right] \cdot \left[ {1 - {N_{stops}} \cdot D} \right] \cdot \left[ {1 - (MAX(\int\limits_{} {dt - {t_{threshold}},0.0))}  \cdot L} \right]
\end{equation}

where the Curve:Quadratic input object named in this field serves to define the quadratic portion in the first set of brackets. For the Normalized mode the full relation for efficiency is,

\begin{equation}
{\varepsilon_{el}} = \left[ {{\varepsilon_0} + {\varepsilon_1} \cdot \frac{{{P_{el}}}}{{{P_{nom}}}} + {\varepsilon_2} \cdot {{\left( {\frac{{{P_{el}}}}{{{P_{nom}}}}} \right)}^2}} \right] \cdot {\varepsilon_{nom}} \cdot \left[ {1 - {N_{stops}} \cdot D} \right] \cdot \left[ {1 - (MAX(\int\limits_0 {dt - {t_{threshold}},0.0))}  \cdot L} \right]
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Field: Number of Run Hours at Beginning of Simulation}\label{field-number-of-run-hours-at-beginning-of-simulation}

This field is used to describe the amount of time the FC has been operating prior to the start of the simulation. FC products might degrade over time so the model includes terms to model the degradation effects of FC run time. This is the initial value of the integrated run time term \(\int\limits_0 {dt}\) .

\paragraph{Field: Accumulated Run Time Degradation Coefficient}\label{field-accumulated-run-time-degradation-coefficient}

This field is used to describe the fixed value representing the fractional performance degradation associated with the total amount of run time. This is the value of \(L\) in the efficiency relations above. If there is no degradation from run time, the L should be 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Run Time Degradation Initiation Time Threshold}\label{field-run-time-degradation-initiation-time-threshold}

This field is used to describe the time period for which there is no degradation associated with the amount of run time. This provides the ability to model a system that initially operates without degradation for some period time before it starts to degrade.

\paragraph{Field: Air Rate Air Temperature Coefficient}\label{field-air-rate-air-temperature-coefficient}

This field is used to describe the air temperature coefficient, \({a_3}\), used to adjust inlet air flow rate in the relations for inlet air rate.

\paragraph{Field: Air Rate Function of Fuel Rate Curve Name}\label{field-air-rate-function-of-fuel-rate-curve-name}

This field contains the name of a Curve:Quadratic input object described elsewhere in the input file. This field is only used if the air supply rate calculation mode is QuadraticFunctionofFuelRate. The quadratic curve named here describes the first part of the relation used to calculate the rate of inlet air, \({\dot N_{air}}\) (kmol/s). It is a quadratic function of the fuel flow rate, \({\dot N_{fuel}}\) .

 \({\dot N_{air}} = \left[ {{a_0} + {a_1} \cdot {{\dot N}_{fuel}} + {a_2} \cdot \dot N_{fuel}^2} \right].\left[ {1 + {a_3} \cdot {T_{air}}} \right]\)

\paragraph{Field: Air Intake Heat Recovery Mode}\label{field-air-intake-heat-recovery-mode}

This field is used to control how heat losses from three other subsystems within the FC may or may not be recovered by the air inlet. There are six possible choices for what to use in this Field: NoRecovery RecoverBurnerInverterStorage RecoverAuxiliaryBurner RecoverInverterandStorage RecoverInverter and RecoverElectricalStorage . If heat is recovered then that means that energy losses from those subsystems are added to the inlet air and fed back into the FC power module. The following table clarifies the meaning of the six possible choices.

\paragraph{Field: Air Supply Constituent Mode}\label{field-air-supply-constituent-mode}

This field is used to choose between two different modes for describing the make up of the inlet air stream. There are two possible choices: AmbientAir or UserDefinedConstituents. Choosing the AmbientAir mode will automatically set the composition of air to be usual at: 77.28\% nitrogen, 20.73\% oxygen, 1.04\% water, 0.92\% argon, and 0.03\% carbon dioxide. Choosing UserDefinedConstituents allows the user to customize the make up the inlet air in the remaining fields.

\paragraph{Field: Number of UserDefined Constituents}\label{field-number-of-userdefined-constituents}

This field is used to describe the number of constituents in the inlet air. This field is only used if the air supply constituent mode is set to UserDefinedConstituents. The maximum number is 5.

The remaining fields in this object are repeating pairs of fields with one pair for each constituent and the same number as described in the previous field. The pairs consist of the name of the constituent followed by the molar fraction of that constituent.

\paragraph{Field: Constituent 1-5 Name}\label{field-constituent-1-5-name}

These fields describe the air stream constituents by name. The name field for each pair must be filled with one of these choices: CarbonDioxide , Nitrogen, Oxygen, Water, or Argon.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-15-003}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-17-000}

This field contains a unique name for the fuel cell water supply subsystem.

\paragraph{Field: Reformer Water Flow Rate Function of Fuel Rate Curve Name}\label{field-reformer-water-flow-rate-function-of-fuel-rate-curve-name}

This field contains the name of a Curve:Quadratic input object described elsewhere in the input file. The curve provides the rate of water flow (kmol/sec) as a function of fuel flow rate (kmol/sec).

\begin{equation}
{\dot N_{liq - water}} = {w_0} + {w_1} \cdot {\dot N_{fuel}} + {w_2} \cdot \dot N_{fuel}^2
\end{equation}

If the unit does not use water for reforming then use a null quadratic where all the coefficients are 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Reformer Water Pump Power Function of Fuel Rate Curve Name}\label{field-reformer-water-pump-power-function-of-fuel-rate-curve-name}

This field contains the name of a Curve:Cubic input object described elsewhere in the input file. The curve provides the power used by the water pump (W) as a cubic function of the rate of water supply (kmol/s).

\begin{equation}
{P_{pump - el}} = {p_0} + {p_1} \cdot {\dot N_{water}} + {p_2} \cdot \dot N_{water}^2 + {p_3} \cdot \dot N_{water}^3
\end{equation}

If the unit does not use water for reforming then use a null cubic where all the coefficients are 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Pump Heat Loss Factor}\label{field-pump-heat-loss-factor}

This field describes the portion of pump electrical power that is lost to the surroundings. The rest of the energy is added to the water stream. A heat loss factor of 1.0 indicates that all the heat is lost to the surroundings and no energy is added to the water inlet stream.

\paragraph{Field: Water Temperature Modeling Mode}\label{field-water-temperature-modeling-mode}

This field describes how the model will determine the inlet temperature of the water stream. There are four options to choose from: TemperatureFromAirNode, TemperatureFromWaterNode, TemperatureFromSchedule, and MainsWaterTemperature. For the first two options, the temperature of the water inlet is determined by the temperature at the node named in the next field. For the third option, the temperature is determined by the schedule in the last field. Using the MainsWaterTemperature option requires also defining a separate Site:WaterMainsTemperature input object elsewhere in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Water Temperature Reference Node Name}\label{field-water-temperature-reference-node-name}

This field is used to define the node where the temperature of the inlet water stream is obtained. This can be either an air node or a water node.

\subsection{Generator:FuelCell:AuxiliaryHeater}\label{generatorfuelcellauxiliaryheater}

This object is intended for modeling an auxiliary heater, however this portion of the model is not yet available in EnergyPlus. An auxiliary heater may be present in fuel cell products so that the unit can meet much higher thermal loads than would be possible using only cogeneration. This portion of the model will be added in the future once suitable cogeneration control capabilities are also available. The input fields are described for future reference but may change. The program still requires one of these objects be included even though the data are not yet used (so that internal data structures can be allocated).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-16-002}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-18-000}

This field contains a unique name for the fuel cell auxiliary heater subsystem.

\paragraph{Field: Excess Air Ratio}\label{field-excess-air-ratio}

This field describes the excess air ratio beyond stoichiometric air supply for the heater. The total air supply ratio will be the value entered here plus 1.0. Thus if 1.0 is entered in this field, the total air flow will be 2.0 times what is needed to exactly match stoichiometry with the fuel supply.

\paragraph{Field: Ancillary Power Constant Term}\label{field-ancillary-power-constant-term}

This field describes the constant term, \({x_0}\) , used to model the auxiliary burner s ancillary devices such as fans and ignition controls. The electrical power for ancillaries is calculated using,

\begin{equation}
{P_{el,aux - ancillaries}} = {x_0} + {x_1} \cdot {\dot N_{aux - fuel}}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Field: Ancillary Power Linear Term}\label{field-ancillary-power-linear-term}

This field describes the linear term, \({x_1}\) , used to model the auxiliary burner s ancillary devices.

\paragraph{Field: Skin Loss U-Factor Times Area Value}\label{field-skin-loss-u-factor-times-area-value-1}

This field describes the UA term (W/K) for calculating skin losses in the auxiliary burner. UA is the product of the overall heat transfer coefficient U and the area A. The skin heat losses are calculated using,

\begin{equation}
{q_{aux - skin - losses}} = {(UA)_{aux}} \cdot ({T_{aux - mix}} - {T_{room}})
\end{equation}

where, \({T_{aux - mix}}\) is temperature of product gases leaving the auxiliary burner and includes the mixing of the product gases from the fuel cell power module. Thus, the input for UA should reflect this choice of reference temperature rather than an exterior surface temperature of the auxiliary burner.

\paragraph{Field: Skin Loss Destination}\label{field-skin-loss-destination}

This field describes the user s choice for what happens to the skin losses. There are two options: SurroundingZone and AirInletForFuelCell . Entering SurroundingZone will direct the model to put the lost energy into the surrounding thermal Zone named in the next field. Entering AirInletForFuelCell will direct the model to put the lost energy into the air inlet stream for the fuel cell to preheat that air.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name to Receive Skin Losses}\label{field-zone-name-to-receive-skin-losses}

This field is used to determine the zone that will receive the skin losses. Enter the name of a Zone declared elsewhere in the input file. This field is only used if the SurroundingZone mode is used in the previous field.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Capacity Units}\label{field-heating-capacity-units}

This field describes the user s choice for how the capacity of the auxiliary heater will be defined. There are two options: Watts or kmol/s. Entering Watts will direct the program to use the next two fields to determine the maximum and minimum heating capacity. Entering kmol/s will direct the program to use the last two fields to determine the maximum and minimum heating capacities.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Heating Capacity in Watts}\label{field-maximum-heating-capacity-in-watts}

This field is used to describe the maximum heating capacity of the auxiliary burner (W).

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Heating Capacity in Watts}\label{field-minimum-heating-capacity-in-watts}

This field is used to describe the minimum heating capacity of the auxiliary burner (W).

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Heating Capacity in Kmol per Second}\label{field-maximum-heating-capacity-in-kmol-per-second}

This field is used to describe the maximum fuel use rate for the auxiliary burner (kmol/s).

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Heating Capacity in Kmol per Second}\label{field-minimum-heating-capacity-in-kmol-per-second}

This field is used to describe the minimum fuel use rate for the auxiliary burner (kmol/s).

This field contains the name of the node that connects the heat exchanger s outlet to the plant loop.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Recovery Water Maximum Flow Rate}\label{field-heat-recovery-water-maximum-flow-rate}

This field describes the design maximum flow rate of the heat recovery water (m\(^{3}\)/s). The value should match the design flow rate of the plant loop connected to the FC.

\paragraph{Field: Exhaust Outlet Air Node Name}\label{field-exhaust-outlet-air-node-name}

This field is used to determine which node will receive the exhaust air stream leaving the FC. This node will usually be outside and not be referenced elsewhere. However, if the exhaust stream is used in a heat recovery ventilator (as described in section 11 of the Annex 42 specification) then the node would be reference in the heat recovery ventilator object.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Exchanger Calculation Method}\label{field-heat-exchanger-calculation-method}

This field is used to direct how EnergyPlus will calculate heat exchanger performance. The Annex 42 model provides for four different methods of modeling the heat exchanger. The choices available for this field are: FixedEffectiveness (method 1 in Annex 42 specification), EmpiricalUAeff (method 2), FundementalUAeff (method 3), or Condensing (method 4). The remaining fields provide input data for the different methods. The heat exchanger correlations are described below.

\paragraph{Field: Method 1 Heat Exchanger Effectiveness}\label{field-method-1-heat-exchanger-effectiveness}

This field describes constant heat exchanger effectiveness, \({\varepsilon_{HX}}\) . This field is only used with the FixedEffectiveness mode, which corresponds to method 1 in the Annex 42 specification. For this mode, the heat exchange between the exhaust gases and the heat recovery water are calculated using,

\begin{equation}
{q_{HX}} = {\varepsilon_{HX}} \cdot {\left( {\dot N{{\hat c}_p}} \right)_{\min }} \cdot \left( {{T_{aux - mix}} - {T_{water,in}}} \right)
\end{equation}

where, \({\left( {\dot N{{\hat c}_p}} \right)_{\min }}\) is the minimum value of \({\left( {\dot N{{\hat c}_p}} \right)_{aux - mix}}\) and \({\left( {\dot N{{\hat c}_p}} \right)_{water}}\) .

\paragraph{Field: Method 2 Parameter hxs0}\label{field-method-2-parameter-hxs0}

This field describes the value of \(h{x_{s,0}}\) in the relation below for effective UA. This field is used with the EmpiricalUAeff mode, which corresponds to method 2 in the Annex 42 specification and with the Condensing mode, which corresponds to method 4 . This method uses the log mean temperature difference (LMTD) approach to calculate the heat exchange:

\begin{equation}
{q_{HX}} = {\left( {UA} \right)_{eff}} \cdot \frac{{\left( {{T_{aux - mix}} - {T_{water,out}}} \right) - \left( {{T_{HX - exh}} - {T_{water,in}}} \right)}}{{\ln \left( {\frac{{{T_{aux - mix}} - {T_{water,out}}}}{{{T_{HX - exh}} - {T_{water,in}}}}} \right)}}
\end{equation}

The user input in this field, and the next four fields, describe coefficients in an empirical relation for \({\left( {UA} \right)_{eff}}\) :

\begin{equation}
{\left( {UA} \right)_{eff}} = h{x_{s,0}} + h{x_{s,1}} \cdot {\dot N_{water}} + h{x_{s,2}} \cdot \dot N_{water}^2 + h{x_{s,3}} \cdot {\dot N_{aux - mix}} + h{x_{s,4}} \cdot \dot N_{aux - mix}^2
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Field: Method 2 Parameter hxs4}\label{field-method-2-parameter-hxs4}

This field describes the value of \(h{x_{s,4}}\) in the relation above for effective UA. This field is used with the EmpiricalUAeff mode, which corresponds to method 2 in the Annex 42 specification and with the Condensing mode, which corresponds to method 4 .

\paragraph{Field: Method 3 h0Gas Coefficient}\label{field-method-3-h0gas-coefficient}

This field describes the value of \(h_{gas}^0\) in the relation below. This field is only used with the FundementalUAeff mode, which corresponds to method 3 in the Annex 42 specification. For this mode, the heat exchange is calculated using the LMTD method, but the effective UA is determined using:

\begin{equation}
{\left( {UA} \right)_{eff}} = {\left[ {\frac{1}{{{{\left( {hA} \right)}_{gas}}}} + \frac{1}{{{{(hA)}_{water}}}} + {F_{HX}}} \right]^{ - 1}}
\end{equation}

where,

\({F_{HX}}\) is an adjustment factor,

\({h_{gas}} = h_{gas}^0 \cdot {\left( {\frac{{{{\dot N}_{gas}}}}{{\dot N_{gas}^0}}} \right)^n}\) ,

\begin{equation}
{h_{water}} = h_{water}^0 \cdot {\left( {\frac{{{{\dot N}_{water}}}}{{\dot N_{water}^0}}} \right)^m}
\end{equation}

In addition to gaseous mixtures, the Micro CHP model is able to use generic liquid fuels and this object is used to describe the properties.

\subsection{Photovoltaic Generators}\label{photovoltaic-generators}

EnergyPlus offers different options for predicting the electricity produced by solar electric photovoltaic (PV) panels. The three different options are Simple , Equivalent One-Diode and Sandia and the choice will determine the mathematical models used to determine energy production. The first allows the user to input an arbitrary efficiency. The other two models use empirical relationships to predict PV operating performance based on many environmental variables such as cell temperature. The PV models can be used with either normal PV modules or as part of a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) flat plat collector.

The generator is connected to an Electric Load Center. The PV models refer to surface input objects defined elsewhere in the input file. This object describes an array that is attached to a surface object in order to describe its orientation and to access results of the solar insolation calculations. These can be either Heat Transfer or Shading objects (see Surfaces). This will define the orientation of the solar panel for the detailed models and also the area for the simple model. The exposure of that surface to incident solar radiation is calculated using the full set of models in EnergyPlus that are used to account for solar thermal loads arising from building windows and walls. Therefore the incident solar radiation is calculated to include the effects of shading and reflections from other surfaces declared in the input file. In addition to the output variables associated with PV models, there are numerous related output variables available for the surfaces including: `Surface Outside Face Sunlit Area', `Surface Outside Face Sunlit Fraction', `Surface Outside Face Incident Solar Radiation Rate per Area', `Surface Outside Face Incident Beam Solar Radiation Rate per Area', `Surface Outside Face Incident Sky Diffuse Solar Radiation Rate per Area', `Surface Outside Face Incident Ground Diffuse Solar Radiation Rate per Area', `Surface Outside Face Beam Solar Incident Angle Cosine Value', `Surface Outside Face Incident Sky Diffuse Ground Reflected Solar Radiation Rate per Area', `Surface Outside Face Incident Sky Diffuse Surface Reflected Solar Radiation Rate per Area', `Surface Outside Face Incident Beam To Beam Reflected From Surfaces Solar Radiation Rate per Area', `Surface Outside Face Incident Beam To Diffuse Surface Reflected Solar Radiation Rate per Area', and 'Surface Outside Face Incident Beam To Diffuse Ground Reflected Solar Radiation Rate per Area. Note that it is possible to define a PV array area that doesn t conform to the surface area (i.e.~model a PV array area that is larger or smaller than what is available on the surface) so it is the users responsibility to not over-specify area when determining how many modules will fit onto a surface. However this type of input is allowed.

EnergyPlus does not include models for ancillary equipment for a PV array including charge controllers or power-point trackers. The operation of the entire electrical system that must go along with a PV array is not currently modeled in EnergyPlus and is therefore assumed to operate in ideal ways. The PV production models do not resolve voltage and current, only power (and energy). Electricity production is metered based on the output of the inverter. Output results are available before and after the inverter. One assumption is that the array is assumed to be always operating at the maximum power point. Energy production is based on the assumption that the quasi-steady power prediction is constant and continuous over the simulation timestep.

For a variety of reasons, actual installations of photovoltaics are often observed to exhibit system-level problems that significantly reduce electricity production. Therefore this modeling should be considered a method of bracketing the upper end of electricity production rather than an accurate prediction of what the panels will produce. Also note that the model predictions are closely related to the solar radiation data (typically of of TMY2 origin) in the EnergyPlus weather file, that the solar data in these is usually from a model rather than direct measurements, and that solar resources encountered by a real installation in a given year are likely to differ from the weather data file.

\subsection{Generator:Photovoltaic}\label{generatorphotovoltaic-000}

Energy exported by the module is removed from the heat transfer surface (at the position determined by the associated Construction with Internal Source). The input fields for Module Heat Capacity and Module Heat Loss Coefficient are ignored.
\item
  \textbf{IntegratedTranspiredCollector} The cell temperature is obtained from the collector surface temperature in the unglazed transpired collector model. Energy exported by the module is removed from the collector surface. The input fields for Module Heat Capacity and Module Heat Loss Coefficient are ignored.
\item
  \textbf{IntegratedExteriorVentedCavity} The cell temperature is obtained from the exterior baffle temperature in the naturally ventilated exterior cavity model.

\item
  \textbf{PhotovoltaicThermalSolarCollector} The cell temperature is obtained from the photovoltaic/thermal solar collector model. If the PV layer is inside the collector, then the incident solar is modified by the photovoltaic/thermal solar collector model.

This field is the user defined fraction for the area of surface named in the parent PV object that will have active PV cells on it. The area actually covered with solar cells will be the net area of the surface (gross area less any subsurfaces like windows) times the fraction entered here. This fraction includes the difference between PV module area and active cells within it and any losses for how closely packed modules can be arranged on surface. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Conversion Efficiency Input Mode}\label{field-conversion-efficiency-input-mode}

This field specifies how the PV array efficiency values are input. There are two choices, \textbf{Fixed} and \textbf{Scheduled}. If this field is set to Fixed then the PV array always has the efficiency value specified in the next field. If this field is set to Scheduled then the efficiency is determined by a user defined schedule named in the second field to follow.

\paragraph{Field: Value for Cell Efficiency if Fixed}\label{field-value-for-cell-efficiency-if-fixed}

This field specifies the efficiency with which solar incident energy is converted to electricity. Efficiency = (electrical power generated {[}W{]})/(power of incident solar{[}W{]}). These efficiency values are dimensionless and should be between 0.0 and 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Efficiency Schedule Name}\label{field-efficiency-schedule-name}

This field should be set to the name of schedule defined elsewhere in the input file. This schedule should specify dimensionless efficiency values between 0.0 and 1.0. This could be used for example to vary the efficiency to match results computed with more detailed models.

\subsection{PhotovoltaicPerformance:Sandia}\label{photovoltaicperformancesandia}

This PhotovoltaicPerformance:Sandia object describes the performance of a single type of module. The model used with this object for predicting the electricity generated by photovoltaics is referred to as the Sandia model. This model is based on work done at Sandia National Lab, Albuquerque, NM by David King -- with the help of many others.

This object describes performance input data needed for specific makes and models of production PV panels using the empirical coefficients assembled by Sandia National Laboratory. There are a large number of empirical coefficients required to use the Sandia model. These data are obtained after extensive measurements and data reduction. This testing has been performed for some types of production panels and Sandia publishes a database of module and array performance parameters on the web at www.sandia.gov/pv. The entries in the database as of January 15, 2004 were converted to idf segments and are included with the EnergyPlus release in the library file SandiaPVData.imf. There are more than hundred different module types included in the library and identified by the manufacturer s model names listed at the beginning of the file SandiaPVData.imf. This data library file is arranged for use with EpMacro but the user can also copy .idf segments directly from the macro data set.

The Sandia model itself can aggregate multiple PV modules. Therefore, an instance of a PhotovoltaicPerformance:Sandia object could actually represent an array of modules as well as the more usual single module. These can be can be thought of as simple larger modules and used by Generator:PV:Sandia objects in the usual manner.

The many empirical coefficients for the model are listed below and are described in more more detail in the EnergyPlus engineering documentation EngineeringDoc.pdf.

The field descriptions below focus on providing the parameter s variable name as identified in the Sandia database. See the the EngineeringDoc.pdf for details on how the input fields are used in the correlations. The user generally would not need to worry about the details of the fields since he/she is not likely to generate the data on their own.

\subsection{Generator:PVWatts}\label{generatorpvwatts}

PVWatts is a web application and module in NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) software that estimates the electricity production of a grid-connected photovoltaic system based on a few simple inputs. This object brings the same calculations from PVWatts into an EnergyPlus whole building simulation without the need to call the web application API or SAM SDK. It provides a good alternative to the \hyperref[generatorphotovoltaic-000]{Generator:Photovoltaic} object when detailed information about the PV array is not available such as in a first pass analysis or when the desire is to achieve comparable results to PVWatts outside of EnergyPlus. To get comparable results to PVWatts, it should be used with the \hyperref[electricloadcenterinverterpvwatts]{ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:PVWatts}.

\paragraph{Field: Array Geometry
Type}\label{field-array-geometry-type}

One of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{TiltAzimuth} - The tilt and azimuth angles are specified in
  the next two fields. An unshaded array is assumed.
\item
  \texttt{Surface} - The array geometry (tilt and azimuth) as well as
  shading is determined from surface referenced.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Tilt Angle}\label{field-tilt-angle}

The tilt angle is the angle from horizontal of the photovoltaic modules
in the array. For a fixed array, the tilt angle is the angle from
horizontal of the array where 0\textdegree = horizontal, and 90\textdegree = vertical. For
arrays with one-axis tracking, the tilt angle is the angle from
horizontal of the tracking axis. The tilt angle does not apply to arrays
with two-axis tracking.

Default: 20\textdegree

\paragraph{Field: Azimuth Angle}\label{field-azimuth-angle}

For a fixed array, the azimuth angle is the angle clockwise from true
north describing the direction that the array faces. An azimuth angle of
180\textdegree is for a south-facing array, and an azimuth angle of 0\textdegree
is for a north-facing array.

For an array with one-axis tracking, the azimuth angle is the angle
clockwise from true north of the axis of rotation. The azimuth angle
does not apply to arrays with two-axis tracking.

Default: 180\textdegree

\paragraph{Field: Surface Name}\label{field-surface-name}

This is the name of a surface that defines the location and geometry of
the array. Required if Array Geometry Type is \texttt{Surface}. Shading
will be calculated for this surface regardless of whether the array has
1- or 2-axis tracking.

\paragraph{Field: Ground Coverage
Ratio}\label{field-ground-coverage-ratio}

The ground coverage ratio (GCR) applies only to arrays with one-axis
tracking, and is the ratio of module surface area to the area of the
ground or roof occupied by the array. A GCR of 0.5 means that when the
modules are horizontal, half of the surface below the array is occupied
by the array. An array with wider spacing between rows of modules has a
lower GCR than one with narrower spacing. A GCR of 1 would be for an
array with no space between modules, and a GCR of 0 for infinite spacing
between rows. Typical values range from 0.3 to 0.6.

Default: 0.4

\subsection{Generator:WindTurbine}\label{generatorwindturbine}

A wind turbine is a component that converts the kinetic energy of the surrounding airstream into electricity. This model is intended to calculate the electrical power that a wind turbine system produces. The performance of wind turbine systems is dependent on the local environmental conditions such as wind speed and density of air at the height of the systems. An analysis of these conditions is necessary to accurately estimate power output. The model obtains the weather information from the weather data file in EnergyPlus and then determines the wind speed and air density at the specific height of the system. It also requires the user to input the annual average wind speed measured at the local site and the height of the measurement so that it factors in differences between the weather file wind data and the local wind data.

The model employs the general kinetic energy equation to calculate the performance characteristics of the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) systems. It provides a simple approximation algorithm when the power coefficient, Cp, is available which represents the efficiency of the wind turbine in the wind power extraction from the ambient air stream. It also allows the user to input experimental constants so that the power coefficient can precisely be determined according to the characteristic of the airfoil of the system. As for the vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) systems, it employs the general mathematical equations for straight-bladed Darrieus-type VAWT systems, which are common to VAWT systems. Various types of VAWT systems such as the Savonius-type and the curved-blade (or Egg-beater) type may be simulated with this same model.

It includes two different types of dynamic power control: FixedSpeedFixedPitch (FSFP) and VariableSpeedFixedPitch (VSFP). Currently, it does not include an algorithm for modeling pitch control such as FixedSpeedVariablePitch (FSVP) and VariableSpeedVariablePitch (VSVP). If the control type of the wind turbine is either FSVP or VSVP, the control type of VSFP will be assumed. In addition, constant power generation is assumed when the ambient wind speed is between the rated wind speed and the cut out wind speed, if the user specifies one of the last three options. The model also has the ability to account for transient losses associate with the power produced during dynamic control by a user-specified fraction.

The model does not include detailed algorithms for generators and inverters due to concerns for computational convergence, time, and usability. Instead, all conversion losses of these subsystems are included by applying a user-supplied total system efficiency to the maximum power extraction of the wind turbine. The field of the total system efficiency must be specified by the user.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-23}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-27}

A unique user assigned name for a particular wind turbine system. Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-8-000}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the wind turbine system can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit is off and will not operate for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Rotor Type}\label{field-rotor-type}

This field is the type of axis of the wind turbine. The user specifies either a horizontal axis wind turbine or a vertical axis wind turbine. Each type of wind turbine employs a different algorithm for the calculation of the electrical power output of the wind turbine. The default value is HorizontalAxisWindTurbine.

\paragraph{Field: Power Control}\label{field-power-control}

This field is the type of rotor control for the wind turbine. This protects the system against the overloading for a system with no speed or pitch control and also to maximize the energy yield for the system. Four different control types are classified in the literature: FixedSpeedFixedPitch (FSFP), FixedSpeedVariablePitch (FSVP), VariableSpeedFixedPitch (VSFP), and VariableSpeedVariablePitch (VSVP). Currently, FSFP and VSFP types can be modeled in EnergyPlus. The other two types will be modeled as VSFP. If the first FSFP control type is chosen, the model assumes the maximum power at a fixed rotor speed when the power output predicted is greater than the maximum until the rotor speed reaches the maximum wind speed (see next field). If one of the last three control options is chosen, the model assumes that the system produces a constant power at the rated wind speed when the wind speed is between the rated wind speed and cut-out wind speed. The default value is VariableSpeedFixedPitch (VSFP).

\paragraph{Field: Rated Rotor Speed}\label{field-rated-rotor-speed}

This field is the maximum rotational speed of the rotor at the rated power of the wind turbine in rev/min (revolution per minute). It is used to determine the tip speed ratio of the rotor and relative flow velocity incident on a single blade of the VAWT systems.

\paragraph{Field: Rotor Diameter}\label{field-rotor-diameter}

This field is the diameter of the rotor in meters. Note that this field is not the height of the blade, but the diameter of the perpendicular circle from the vertical pole in the VAWT systems. It determines the swept area of the rotor of the HAWT systems and the chordal velocity of the VAWT systems.

\paragraph{Field: Overall Height}\label{field-overall-height}

This field is the height of the hub of the HAWT system, or of the pole of the VAWT system in meters. It is necessary to estimate local air density and the wind speed at this particular height where the wind turbine system is installed.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Blades}\label{field-number-of-blades}

This field is the number of blades of the wind turbine. The azimuth angle of the rotor of the VAWT system is determined by dividing 360 degree by this field so that the model determines the chordal velocity component and the normal velocity component of the system. The default value is 3.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Power}\label{field-rated-power}

This field is the nominal power output of the wind turbine system at the rated wind speed in Watts. Note that the user should input the maximum power of the system with no control, i.e., FSFP control type, can physically produce. Manufacturers data also indicates it as peak power or rated capacity . If the local wind speed is greater than the rated wind speed, the model assumes constant power output of this field.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Wind Speed}\label{field-rated-wind-speed}

This field is the wind speed that the wind turbine system indicates the peak in the power curve in m/s. The system produces the maximum power at this speed and the speed of the rotor is managed based on this wind speed.

\paragraph{Field: Cut In Wind Speed}\label{field-cut-in-wind-speed}

This field is the lowest wind speed where the wind turbine system can be operated in m/s. No power generation is achieved as long as the ambient wind speed is lower than this speed.

\paragraph{Field: Cut Out Wind Speed}\label{field-cut-out-wind-speed}

This field is the greatest wind speed in m/s. When the wind speed exceeds this value, the wind turbine system needs to be stopped because of inefficiencies in the system. All systems that have either pitch or speed control must be stopped when the ambient wind speed exceeds this speed. Note that the user should input a wind speed above which physical damage to the system might be caused in the case of a FSFP system. It appears as extreme/survival/design wind speed in the literature. The system will be turned off when the ambient wind speed is over this speed.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction System Efficiency}\label{field-fraction-system-efficiency}

This field is the overall system efficiency of the wind turbine system. It includes all the conversion losses as well as transient losses during the dynamic control when the ambient wind speed is between the rated wind speed and cut-out wind speed (see previous fields). The user also has the ability to specify delivery losses from the system to the local area. If the user does not enter a fraction, the model assumes the default value of 0.835. Note that the fraction must be between zero and one.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Tip Speed Ratio}\label{field-maximum-tip-speed-ratio}

This field is the maximum tip speed ratio between the rotor velocity and ambient wind velocity. The rotor speed varies with this ratio to maximize the power output when the rotor control types are variable speed ones. This field allows the user to adjust the power output from the particular system or to find the optimal tip speed ratio of the system. Optimal tip speed ratio is dependent on the number of blades. It is typically about 6, 5, and 3 for two-bladed, three-bladed, and four-bladed rotor, respectively. For the vertical axis wind turbine, it is smaller than horizontal axis wind turbine, and varies with the chord area. The default and maximum values are 5.0 and 12.0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Power Coefficient}\label{field-maximum-power-coefficient}

This field is the maximum fraction of power extraction from ambient wind. If the user inputs this field, the simple approximation model is assumed. The model simply employs the value of this field into the general kinetic energy equation, so that the power output is obtained. The user can obtain this field with a simple calculation from the power curve published in almost all manufacturers' specifications by using the kinetic energy equation as:

\begin{equation}
{C_p} = \frac{P}{{0.5\rho A{V^3}}}
\end{equation}

where

\emph{P} = power production at the rated wind speed {[}W{]}

\emph{ρ} = density of air {[}kg/m3{]}

\emph{A} = swept area of rotor {[}m2{]}

\emph{V} = rated wind speed {[}m/s{]}

\emph{C\(_{p}\)} = power coefficient

The maximum and default values are 0.59 and 0.35.

\paragraph{Field: Annual Local Average Wind Speed}\label{field-annual-local-average-wind-speed}

This field is the local annual average wind speed that represents a representative wind profile at the location of the system in m/s. It is used to factor the difference in wind speed between the weather file wind data and the locally measured wind data so that the model minimizes uncertainties caused by improper wind data at the particular location. Considerable differences between the weather file wind data and the local wind data typically appear. The user thus needs to enter this field in order to obtain accurate local wind data. The model internally determines a multiplier and it is multiplied by the weather file wind data adjusted at the height of the system. If this field is not entered, then the model will use the wind speed from the design day or weather file information with only adjustment at the height of the rotor.

\paragraph{Field: Height for Local Average Wind Speed}\label{field-height-for-local-average-wind-speed}

This field is the height that the local wind speed is measured in meters. The annual average wind speed (see previous field) input by the user is internally recalculated by existing EnergyPlus functions at the height of the local station. This modified wind speed is then factored and applied to the weather file wind data. If the annual local average wind speed is not entered, this field is then assumed as zero. The minimum and default values are zero and 50 meters.

\paragraph{Field: Blade Chord Area}\label{field-blade-chord-area}

This field is the blade chord area of a single blade of VAWT system in m2. It is necessary to determine the net tangential and normal forces of a single blade.

\paragraph{Field: Blade Drag Coefficient}\label{field-blade-drag-coefficient}

This field is the blade drag coefficient for a specific blade. It is for determining the tangential and normal force coefficients with the blade lift coefficient (see next field) so that the model can calculate the power output from the system. The user should be able to obtain this parameter for a specific blade from the manufacturers data. This field is only valid for VAWT systems.

\paragraph{Field: Blade Lift Coefficient}\label{field-blade-lift-coefficient}

This field is the blade lift coefficient for a specific blade. It is for determining the tangential and normal force coefficients with the blade drag coefficient (see previous field) so that the model can calculate the power output from the system. The user should also be able to obtain it for a specific blade from the manufacturers data. This field is only valid for VAWT systems.

\paragraph{Field: Power Coefficient Parameter \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-power-coefficient-parameter-x}

These six fields are the parameters for the power coefficient equation shown below. These fields are used to determine the power coefficient of the system. The analytical approximation model of the power coefficient in EnergyPlus is:

\begin{equation}
{C_p} = {C_1}(\frac{{{C_2}}}{{{\lambda_i}}} - {C_3}\theta  - {C_4}{\theta ^x} - {C_5}){e^{ - \frac{{{C_6}(\lambda ,\theta )}}{{{\lambda_i}}}}}
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{{{\lambda_i}}} = \frac{1}{{\lambda  + 0.08\theta }} - \frac{{0.035}}{{{\theta ^3} + 1}}
\end{equation}

where

\(C_p\) = power coefficient

\(C_{1-6}\) = empirical power coefficient parameters

\(\lambda\) = tip speed ratio (often known as TSR)

\(\lambda_i\) = tip speed ratio at ith time step

\(\theta\) = azimuth angle of the pitch, 0 {[}degree{]}

If the user does not input any field of these parameters, the simple approximation model for the power coefficient will be used (see previous maximum power coefficient field). That is, the analytical approximation model of the power coefficient will be chosen only if the user inputs all these six parameters. The user also has the ability to modify each parameter when the specific value of the system is available. The default values are given in the table below.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llllll@{}}

These fields are only valid for HAWT systems.
