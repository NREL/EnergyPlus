\section{Group -- Node-Branch Management}\label{group-node-branch-management}

\textbf{Nodes}, \textbf{Branch} \textbf{Lists} and \textbf{Branches} define the topography of the HVAC connections.

\subsection{NodeList}\label{nodelist}

For convenience, the NodeList object can be used to identify all the nodes for a particular use. A node list is not always required. The advantage of listing all the nodes in this manner is that input fields in other objects that ask for a node name can refer to either a single node or a list of nodes using this object. .

There are other lines of input syntax that require the use of a NodeList as part of the input. These syntax items include: \hyperref[outdoorairnodelist]{OutdoorAir:NodeList} and the SetpointManager objects. In these two cases, the use of a NodeList statement is mandatory if there is more than one node in this particular ``list''. For example, if the outside air only has a single inlet node, then the name of that node can replace the node list name in the input syntax. As a result of this mandatory specification of node lists for certain types of input, nodes can, obviously, and may be members of more than one list.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-027}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-026}

This alpha designation must be unique among all the Node List Names. It is used as reference in various objects (e.g.~\hyperref[outdoorairnodelist]{OutdoorAir:NodeList}).

\paragraph{Field: Node \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name ~(up to 25 allowed)}\label{field-node-name-up-to-25-allowed}

Each unique Node identifier creates a Node structure with various attributes depending on the type of node. Typical values include Temperature, Mass Flow Rate, and Temperature Set Point. The alpha designators are associated with a particular node.

Though each NodeList is limited to 25 nodes, several node lists may be entered if you choose to identify all the nodes up front. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
NodeList, Nodes1-25,
NODE_1,NODE_2,NODE_3,NODE_4,NODE_5,NODE_6,NODE_7,NODE_8,NODE_9,NODE_10,

NODE_21,NODE_22,NODE_23,NODE_24,NODE_25;
NodeList, Nodes26-49,NODE_26,NODE_27,NODE_28,NODE_29,NODE_30,
NODE_31,NODE_32,NODE_33,NODE_34,NODE_35,NODE_36,NODE_37,NODE_38,NODE_39,NODE_40,
NODE_41,NODE_42,NODE_43,NODE_44,NODE_45,NODE_46,NODE_47,NODE_48,NODE_49;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-019}

A simple detail of Nodes and numbers assigned appears in the \textbf{eplusout.bnd} file:

The current volume flow rate at a system node in m\(^{3}\)/s based on the current density.~ This report differs from the one called ``System Node Standard Density Volume Flow Rate'' in that it uses an air density calculated for the current moist air conditions rather than a standard density.

\paragraph{System Node Current Density {[}kg/m3{]}}\label{system-node-current-density-kgm3}

The current air density at a system node in kg/m3.~ This is the density used to calculate the volume flow rate above.~ The density is calculated using current outdoor air barometric pressure and the drybulb temperature and humidity ratio at the air node.

\textbf{Advanced Node Reporting}

The following system node variables are available when you request ``Diagnostics, DisplayAdvancedReportVariable;''. They are normally used for debugging unusual system cases and may not be available for all systems. Also, their definitions may change based on the usage in the system.

\paragraph{System Node Minimum Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{system-node-minimum-temperature-c}

\paragraph{System Node Maximum Limit Mass Flow Rate {[}kg/s{]}}\label{system-node-maximum-limit-mass-flow-rate-kgs}

These node variables hold the maximum possible and the minimum allowable flow rates for a particular component. As such, they represent the ``hardware limit'' on the flow rate for the component. By convention, these variables are stored at the component inlet node. Since components share their nodes (the outlet node of one component is the inlet node of the next component), the protocol must be strictly followed. These variables are set by each component based on the design flow limits of the equipment.

\paragraph{System Node Minimum Available Mass Flow Rate {[}kg/s{]}}\label{system-node-minimum-available-mass-flow-rate-kgs}

\paragraph{System Node Maximum Available Mass Flow Rate {[}kg/s{]}}\label{system-node-maximum-available-mass-flow-rate-kgs}

These node variables represent the \emph{loop} or \emph{branch} maximum and minimum flow rate for the current configuration of the loop on which the component resides. The central plant routines manage these variables dynamically to resolve flow rates through branches located inside splitters and mixers.

\paragraph{System Node Setpoint Mass Flow Rate {[}kg/s{]}}\label{system-node-setpoint-mass-flow-rate-kgs}

The current mass flow rate setpoint at a system node in kg/s. Some controllers and equipment types sense this single setpoint.

\paragraph{System Node Requested Mass Flow Rate {[}kg/s{]}}\label{system-node-requested-mass-flow-rate-kgs}

This output is the current mass flow rate request at a system node in kg/s.~ Only used for plant simulations and nodes.~ This is the mass flow rate ``requested'' by a component.~ This is a record of what the component wanted which can be useful for diagnostics when the actual simulated flow is different than expected.~ This value is also used to determine overall loop flow rates.

\paragraph{System Node CO2 Concentration {[}ppm{]}}\label{system-node-co2-concentration-ppm}

The average carbon dioxide concentration, in parts per million (ppm), at a system node for the timestep being reported.

\paragraph{System Node Generic Air Contaminant Concentration {[}ppm{]}}\label{system-node-generic-air-contaminant-concentration-ppm}

The average generic contaminant concentration, in parts per million (ppm), at a system node for the timestep being reported.

\subsection{BranchList}\label{branchlist}

A branch list is intended to define the branches or portions of a particular loop that are present on an individual plant or condenser loop. Thus, the BranchList syntax simply provides a list of branch names (see Branch syntax) that then refer to more detailed syntax in another part of the input file. The syntax for describing a list of branches is given below.

Branches in BranchList objects should be listed in flow order: inlet branch, then parallel branches, then outlet branch. Branches (within a splitter/mixer) are simulated in the order listed.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-025}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-024}

A unique name to identify the branch list.

\paragraph{Field: Branch \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-branch-name}

Branch name in the list.~ As noted above, Branches in BranchList objects MUST be listed in flow order: inlet branch, then parallel branches, then outlet branch. Branches are simulated in the order listed.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

\begin{lstlisting}

BranchList, Cooling Supply Side Branches,
       CW Pump Branch,
       Little Chiller Branch,
       Big Chiller Branch,
       Purchased Cooling Branch,
       Supply Bypass Branch,
       Cooling Supply Outlet;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-1-016}

No output directly related to Branch Lists current is presented.

\subsection{Branch}\label{branch}

Branches can be considered the mid-level grouping of items in the EnergyPlus HVAC loop scheme. Components are the lowest level of information. A collection of components in series forms a branch. Every branch must have at least one component, but it may have several components in series. The air loop also has ``unitary'' objects that are compound objects that wrap components and when they are used it is the unitary objects that appear on the Branch and not the child components.~ The \textbf{Branch} defines the order that components appear on the branch. Moreover, a collection of branches and their connecting information form a loop. Therefore, a branch is a collection of components while a loop is a collection of branches. Thus, components are specified for particular HVAC loops by assigning them to branches and then connecting those branches together to form a loop.

For hydronic plant systems, the Branch object is used on both the demand side and the supply side of the plant loop.~ For HVAC air systems, the Branch object is only used to describe the components on the supply side of an air loop. The demand side of the air loop does not use the Branch object.~ The outside air system appears on a Branch object but it does not use a Branch object itself to describe the components that included in the outside air system.~ So-called ``ZoneHVAC:*'' equipment, HVAC equipment directly associated with a zone, do not use the Branch object.

It should be noted that each component also has at least two nodes associated with it---an inlet node and an outlet node. These nodes, by default, are also part of the branch to which their components are assigned.~ Although it may appear redundant to list the node names in both the Branch and in the component object being referenced, this is needed because many components are connected to more than one loop at a time and the node names are needed here to distinguish which portion of the component is being attached to this particular branch and its loop.~ It should be noted that each branch must have at least one component on it. A ``null'' branch such as one where the first component on the loop is in reality a splitter or mixer should be defined as a single Pipe component for plant, or a single Duct component for air systems.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-023}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-2-022}

This alpha field is the unique, user-defined name that allows the branch to be referenced by other elements such as the \hyperref[plantloop]{PlantLoop} and \hyperref[condenserloop]{CondenserLoop} statements.

\paragraph{Field: Pressure Drop Curve Name}\label{field-pressure-drop-curve-name}

This is an optional field used to specify pressure drop information for this particular branch. Currently this is only available in plant/condenser fluid loops: \hyperref[plantloop]{PlantLoop} and \hyperref[condenserloop]{CondenserLoop}. Air loops require a full airflow network, so this field is ignored if found on an air loop. The value entered for this field must match a pressure curve object also found in the input. This curve can be of the type: \hyperref[curvelinear]{Curve:Linear}, \hyperref[curvequadratic]{Curve:Quadratic}, \hyperref[curvecubic]{Curve:Cubic}, \hyperref[curveexponent]{Curve:Exponent}, or \hyperref[curvefunctionalpressuredrop]{Curve:Functional:PressureDrop}. In order to then perform a pressure simulation for the loop that this branch is located on, a flag must be set in the loop object. Reference the \hyperref[plantloop]{PlantLoop} and \hyperref[condenserloop]{CondenserLoop} field ``Pressure Simulation Type'' for allowable settings. See the Engineering Reference document for further information on pressure simulation in plant loops.

\paragraph{Field Set (Branch Specifications)}\label{field-set-branch-specifications}

Following the two introductory items, there are groups of 4 repeated items: a type, a name, inlet and outlet node names. All of these items refer to one particular component on the branch. The first component defined by these items will be the first component on this branch, etc. through the end of the list.~ This object is extensible and can use as many field sets as needed.

\paragraph{Field: Component \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Object Type}\label{field-component-object-type-000}

This field is the component object type (object class name). The component type refers to other elements within the input file and specifies what kind of component this is. The objects in the~ Group -- Plant Equipment section are valid here when the Branch is used in Plant specifications. Fans, coils, unitary systems, and Outside Air Systems are also valid component types for the Branch object. Pipes or Ducts are also valid for this field.~ No splitter or mixer type objects are allowed.

\paragraph{Field: Component \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-component-name-001}

The component name is the unique, user-defined reference name to distinguish between potentially multiple occurrences of a particular component type in an input file. The set of component type and component name must be unique. (You can only have 1 Boiler object with name MYBOILER).

\paragraph{Field: Component \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Inlet Node Name}\label{field-component-inlet-node-name}

This field references an inlet node name that will be found in the actual component specification.~ The inlet node, and the outlet node specified in the next field, should correspond to component model's connections that are intended for the loop that this Branch is assigned to.~ For example a water-cooled chiller will have two inlet nodes, one for chilled water return and one for condenser water return and so the chiller will appear on two Branch objects accordingly.

\paragraph{Field: Component \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Outlet Node Name}\label{field-component-outlet-node-name}

This field references an outlet node name that will be found in the actual component specification.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

\begin{lstlisting}

Branch,
      Air Loop Main Branch,    !- Branch Name
      ,                        !- Pressure Drop Curve Name
      AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass,  !- Comp1 Type
      GasHeat CBVAV System,    !- Comp1 Name
      Air Loop Inlet Node,     !- Comp1 Inlet Node Name
      Air Loop Outlet Node;    !- Comp1 Outlet Node Name
\end{lstlisting}

And a more complex one:

\begin{lstlisting}

  BRANCH,
      Air Loop Main Branch,    !- Branch Name
      ,                        !- Pressure Drop Curve Name
      FAN:SIMPLE:ConstVolume,  !- Comp1 Type
      Supply Fan 1,            !- Comp1 Name
      Air Loop Inlet Node,     !- Comp1 Inlet Node Name
      Cooling Coil Air Inlet Node,  !- Comp1 Outlet Node Name
      COIL:Water:DetailedFlatCooling,  !- Comp2 Type
      Detailed Cooling Coil,   !- Comp2 Name
      Cooling Coil Air Inlet Node,  !- Comp2 Inlet Node Name
      Air Loop Outlet Node;    !- Comp2 Outlet Node Name
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-2-014}

The components on a branch are in series and that list is in simulation and connection order. Each branch must obey the rules: the outlet for component 1 has to have the same node name as the inlet for component 2, and so forth.

Eplusout.err contains the test for ``individual branch integrity'':

\begin{lstlisting}
   ************* Testing Individual Branch Integrity
   ************* Testing Branch = AIR LOOP MAIN BRANCH
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch = COOLING DEMAND INLET
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch = COOLING COIL BRANCH
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch = DEMAND BYPASS BRANCH
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch = COOLING DEMAND OUTLET
   ************* ....passed
   ************* Testing Branch = COOLING SUPPLY OUTLET
   ************* ....passed
\end{lstlisting}

The addition of pressure simulation for branches in fluid loops brings a new output at the branch level:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  HVAC,Average,Plant Branch Pressure Difference {[}Pa{]}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Plant Branch Pressure Difference {[}Pa{]}}\label{plant-branch-pressure-difference-pa}

This field allows the user to output the pressure drop of a particular branch on a plant loop or condenser loop. This output is only recognized if a valid pressure simulation is being performed. To do this, the user must specify a pressure simulation type as an input in the PlantLoop or CondenserLoop object.

\subsection{ConnectorList}\label{connectorlist}

A connector list is a collection of either one or two connection devices (\hyperref[connectormixer]{Connector:Mixer} or \hyperref[connectorsplitter]{Connector:Splitter}). Due to the definition of a loop in EnergyPlus, there is a maximum of one mixer and one splitter allowed for each loop segment. This limitation still allows a tremendous amount of flexibility to the user and can also still be solved within a reasonable amount of time and without a complex solver routine. The connection list simply allows the specification of the types and names of these devices. This allows the main loop statements to have the flexibility to have multiple lists that can have one or more item.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-3-021}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-3-019}

This field is an identifying name that will be referenced to main loop statements using this connector list. The name must be unique among connector list names.

\paragraph{Field-Set: Connection Object Type and Identifying Name (up to 2 allowed)}\label{field-set-connection-object-type-and-identifying-name-up-to-2-allowed}

Depending on the loop, either one or two of the connectors will be specified. If this particular loop only has a single connector (either \hyperref[connectormixer]{Connector:Mixer} or \hyperref[connectorsplitter]{Connector:Splitter}), then only the first two items (type of connection and identifying name of connector) are included. If both a mixer and splitter are present, the additional type of connection and identifying name must be included. Note that the order that the items appear is inconsequential---either the \hyperref[connectormixer]{Connector:Mixer} or the \hyperref[connectorsplitter]{Connector:Splitter} may appear first. This will not affect the simulation.

\paragraph{Field: Connector 1 Object Type}\label{field-connector-1-object-type}

This field contains the connector type \textbf{\hyperref[connectormixer]{Connector:Mixer}} or \textbf{\hyperref[connectorsplitter]{Connector:Splitter}}.

\paragraph{Field: Connector 1 Name}\label{field-connector-1-name}

This field is an identifying name for the connector. It will be used by other objects in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Connector 2 Object Type (optional)}\label{field-connector-2-object-type-optional}

This field contains the connector type \textbf{\hyperref[connectormixer]{Connector:Mixer}} or \textbf{\hyperref[connectorsplitter]{Connector:Splitter}}.

\paragraph{Field: Connector 2 Name (optional)}\label{field-connector-2-name-optional}

This field is an identifying name for the connector. It will be used by other objects in the input file.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

\begin{lstlisting}

ConnectorList LIST, Cooling Supply Side Connectors,
      Connector:Splitter, CW Loop Splitter,
      Connector:Mixer, CW Loop Mixer;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-3-012}

No output directly related to Connector Lists is currently presented.

\subsection{Pipe:Adiabatic}\label{pipeadiabatic}

In reality, every component is connected to its closest neighbors via a pipe or a duct. At the current time, such detail is not needed in EnergyPlus. Thus, the Pipe:Adiabatic component is currently used more as a connection device (for branches that really do not have any components associated with them) or as a bypass than anything else. As such, its input is very simple and its algorithm is equally simple. The current algorithm for a pipe is simply to pass the inlet conditions to the outlet of the pipe component.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-4-019}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-4-016}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the pipe.

\paragraph{Field: Inlet Node Name}\label{field-inlet-node-name-001}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the pipe inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Outlet Node Name}\label{field-outlet-node-name-002}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the pipe outlet node.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

\begin{lstlisting}

Pipe:Adiabatic,
      Demand Side Inlet Pipe,
      CW Demand Inlet Node,
      CW Demand Entrance Pipe Outlet Node;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-4-009}

There are no outputs directly related to Pipes.

\subsection{Pipe:Adiabatic:Steam}\label{pipeadiabaticsteam}

To connect the various components in a steam system regardless of it being the condensate or the steam side of the loop steam pipe needs to be used. In reality, every component is connected to its closest neighbors via a pipe or a duct. At the current time, such detail is not needed in EnergyPlus. Thus, the Pipe:Adiabatic:Steam component is currently used more as a connection device (for branches that really do not have any components associated with them). As such, its input is very simple and its algorithm is equally simple. The current algorithm for a pipe is simply to pass the inlet conditions to the outlet of the pipe component.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-5-017}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-5-013}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the steam pipe.

\paragraph{Field: Inlet Node Name}\label{field-inlet-node-name-1-000}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the steam pipe inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Outlet Node Name}\label{field-outlet-node-name-1-001}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the steampipe outlet node.

An example of this statement in an IDF is:

\begin{lstlisting}

Pipe:Adiabatic:Steam,
      Steam Demand 1 Steam Inlet Pipe,            !- PipeName
      Steam Demand 1 Steam Demand Inlet Node,     !- Inlet Node Name

\item
  \hyperref[pipingsystemundergroundpipecircuit]{PipingSystem:Underground:PipeCircuit}
\item
  \hyperref[pipingsystemundergroundpipesegment]{PipingSystem:Underground:PipeSegment}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PipingSystem:Underground:Domain}\label{pipingsystemundergrounddomain}

This section documents the domain object, which is used to specify information for the overall ground domain, including thermal properties, mesh parameters, and surface interaction.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-9-011}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-9-010}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the ground domain.

\paragraph{Field: XMax, YMax, ZMax}\label{field-xmax-ymax-zmax}

These numeric fields are used to specify the overall domain size, in each of the three Cartesian dimensions.~ The domain will be meshed from \{x, y, z\} = \{0, 0, 0\} to \{Xmax, Ymax, Zmax\}.

Note that for this object, the x-z plane lies parallel to the ground surface, such that the y-dimension can be thought of as representing the burial depth.~ This is in contrast to the way building surface coordinates are defined with the x-y plane lying parallel to the ground.~ Also note that any pipe segments that end up being used in a ground domain will be placed axially in the z-dimension.~ Thus, pipe flow will always be in either the positive z or negative z direction.

\paragraph{Field: X-Direction Mesh Density Parameter}\label{field-x-direction-mesh-density-parameter}

This numeric integer field represents the number of cells to be placed between any two ``domain partitions'' during mesh development.~ A domain partition may be thought of as a basement wall/floor, or a pipe.~ Once these components are laid out in the domain, this field number of cells are placed between the partitions.~ Further information on this is found in the engineering reference manual.

\paragraph{Field: X-Direction Mesh Type}\label{field-x-direction-mesh-type}

This alpha field represents the type of mesh to create when placing cells between ``domain partitions.''~ Two options are available: ``uniform'' and ``symmetricgeometric.''~ For uniform, the cells are placed in the region with all cells having equal size.~ For symmetric-geometric, the cells are compressed toward the partitions so that there are more cells on either side of the mesh region.~ This can help focus computational intensity on the boundary areas where it is likely more desired.~ For symmetric-geometric mesh distribution, the mesh density parameter should be an even number to provide the symmetric condition.

\paragraph{Field: X-Direction Geometric Coefficient}\label{field-x-direction-geometric-coefficient}

This numeric field represents the compression of cell distribution if the x-direction mesh type is set to ``symmetricgeometric.''~ If the mesh type is uniform, this field is not interpreted.~ For symmetric geometric, a value in this field equal to 1 would result in a uniform distribution, while a value of 2 would provide a highly skewed distribution.

\paragraph{Field: Width of Basement Floor in Ground Domain}\label{field-width-of-basement-floor-in-ground-domain-1}

If this domain does include basement interaction, this represents the depth of the domain cutaway to include the basement.~ In essence, this is the burial depth of the basement to include in the ground simulation.~ This depth should include the basement floor thickness.

\paragraph{Field: Shift Pipe X Coordinates By Basement Width}\label{field-shift-pipe-x-coordinates-by-basement-width}

If this domain does include basement interaction, this flag specifies whether the pipe segment X-values should then be shifted by the basement width.~ In essence, this specifies the reference point for pipe segment x-values: if NO then the reference is domain x = 0, if YES then the reference is the basement width point.

\paragraph{Field: Name of Basement Wall Boundary Condition Model}\label{field-name-of-basement-wall-boundary-condition-model}

The name of an OtherSideConditions model defined in the input file and referenced by the surfaces which should be included as ``wall surfaces'' for the basement interaction part of the ground heat transfer model.

The maximum number of iterations to make when performing temperature updates of the Cartesian coordinate system.~ The actual number of iterations made will of course depend on transient conditions and convergence tolerance.

\paragraph{Field: Evapotranspiration Ground Cover Parameter}\label{field-evapotranspiration-ground-cover-parameter-000}

Numeric field specifies the ground cover effects used in the evapotranspiration model at the ground surface heat balance. The values range from 0 (solid, nonpermeable ground surface) to 1.5 (wild growth).

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-11-008}

This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the pipe segment.

\paragraph{Field: X Position}\label{field-x-position}

This numeric field represents the x-direction placement of the pipe.~ If no basement is included in the simulation, this is measured from x = 0.~ If a basement is included, and the domain object specifies that pipes should be shifted, this is measured from the basement wall.

\paragraph{Field: Y Position}\label{field-y-position}

This numeric field represents the burial depth of the pipe, measured from the ground surface.~ This will always be a positive number.

\paragraph{Field: Flow Direction}\label{field-flow-direction}

This alpha field is used to define the flow direction within this pipe segment.~ The choices are ``increasing'' or ``decreasing.''~ These can be chosen carefully to encapsulate specific short-circuiting effects due to varying flow configurations (circuiting).

An example of this object in an IDF is offered here for a foundation heat exchanger

\subsection{Duct}\label{duct}

The Duct object is a component for air systems that is a direct analogue for \hyperref[pipeadiabatic]{Pipe:Adiabatic} in the fluid loops. It is used when it is necessary (due to the HVAC system configuration) to have a branch that has no functional components. This case most often arises for a bypass branch. Since every branch must have at least one component, the Duct component is used for this situation. The duct is an adiabatic, pass-through component; all of its inlet conditions are passed through unchanged to its outlet.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-12-009}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-12-006}

This is the unique name for this component. Any reference to this component (in a \hyperref[branchlist]{BranchList}, for instance) will refer to it by this name.

\paragraph{Field: Inlet Node Name}\label{field-inlet-node-name-2-000}

The name of the component's air inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Outlet Node Name}\label{field-outlet-node-name-2-000}

The name of the component's air outlet node.
