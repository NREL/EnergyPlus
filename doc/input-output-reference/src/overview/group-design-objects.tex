\subsection{Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing}\label{input-for-design-calculations-and-component-autosizing}

\subsubsection{Overview}\label{overview-000}

In order for EnergyPlus to successfully calculate zone design heating and cooling loads and air flow rates and for the program to use these results to automatically size the HVAC components a number of input objects must be present and certain object input fields must be entered.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The input file should contain a SimulationControl object. The 1\(^{st}\) field \emph{Do Zone Sizing Calculation} should be entered as \emph{Yes}. This will cause a zone sizing simulation to be done using all the sizing periods in the input file as weather. If there are no air or water loops in the HVAC input fields 2 and 3 can be set to \emph{No.} If there are one or more air loops (i.e., there is at least one AirLoopHVAC object in the input file) then the 2\(^{nd}\) field \emph{Do System Sizing Calculation} should be entered as \emph{Yes}. If there are one or more water loops (Plant Loop objects) then the 3\(^{rd}\) field \emph{Do Plant Sizing Calculation} should be set to \emph{Yes}. Finally either the 4\(^{th}\) field (\emph{Run Simulation for Sizing Periods}) or the 5\(^{th}\) field (\emph{Run Simulation for Weather File Run Periods}) should be set to \emph{Yes} in order to autosize the components and do a real simulation using the autosized components. The component autosizing calculations are done on the first pass through the HVAC system in the real simulation.
\item
  There must be at least 2 (up to any number) SizingPeriod objects present. Normally one will be for summer conditions and one for winter. The summer day should normally have the field \emph{Day Type} set to \emph{SummerDesignDay}. The winter design day should normally have \emph{Day Type} set to \emph{WinterDesignDay}.
\item
  To apply a global sizing factor include the Sizing:Parameters object.
\item
  For each controlled zone in the input file there should be a corresponding Sizing:Zone object. Similarly for each AirLoopHVAC there should be a Sizing:System object. And for each Plant or Condenser Loop there should be a Sizing:Plant object. Note however that if a controlled zone has no corresponding Zone Sizing object the data from the first Zone Sizing object will be used. Thus if all the zone sizing information is the same only one Zone Sizing object need be entered.
\item
  Only controlled zones are included in the zone and system sizing calculations. Thus for a design air flow rate to be calculated for a zone, it must contain a thermostat \emph{even though it might not need or have a thermostat in the full simulation}. An illustration would be a three zone building with a packaged single zone system and a thermostat in one of the zones. In order for the two slave zones to be included in the design air flow calculations they must be treated as if they have a thermostat: there must be a ZoneControl:Thermostat for each of the slave zones.
\item
  Some attention should be paid to schedules. In a weekly schedule object the 9\(^{th}\) and 10\(^{th}\) day schedules are for summer and winter design days respectively. This means that if a SizingPeriod object has field \emph{Day Type} set to \emph{SummerDesignDay} ~the day schedule for summer sizing periods will be in effect. Similarly if a SizingPeriod object has field \emph{Day Type} set to \emph{WinterDesignDay} ~the day schedule for winter sizing periods will be in effect. Some possible applications of this capability are:
\end{itemize}

1)~~~setting internal loads (lights, equipment, occupancy) to maximum all day for cooling and to zero all day for heating;

2)~~~setting heating and cooling thermostat set points to constant values (no set up or set back);

3)~~~setting heating and cooling equipment to be always on.

None of these applications are necessarily recommended but these and other uses of the special summer/winter design day schedules may prove useful for specific situations.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Other than zone thermostat setpoints, the sizing calculations generally know nothing about the system control inputs such as setpoints and availability schedules. The user must coordinate sizing inputs with the actual simulation control inputs.
\item
  The sizing calculations only recognize the presence of central heating and cooling coils, preheat and precool coils and reheat coils. These are assumed to deliver the various supply temperatures specified in the Sizing:System and Sizing:Zone objects. The impact of other components such as heat recovery, dehumidifiers, and pumps are not accounted for in the sizing calculations. Central supply and return fan temperature rise is taken into account in sizing the central cooling coils.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Component Autosizing}\label{component-autosizing}

For autosizing to occur at the component level the user must enter the special value \emph{autosize} in the numeric fields for which autosizing is available. Those fields can be found by looking at the Energy+.idd data dictionary file or under individual object details in this document. Fields that can be autosized are denoted with the comment \emph{\textbackslash{}autosizable}. The components and fields that are autosizable are listed in the following table. Note that spaces may be inserted in object names to facilitate readability.

There are 3 places in the input where the user can impose sizing factors.

1.~~~~In Sizing Parameters (object: Sizing:Parameters), the user can specify an over-all sizing factor. This factor is applied to all the zone design loads and air flow rates resulting from the zone sizing calculations.

2.~~~~In Zone Sizing (object: Sizing:Zone), the user can specify a sizing factor for a specific zone. The factor is applied to the calculated zone design loads and air flow rates for the zone named in the Sizing:Zone object. This sizing factor overrides the global sizing factor. That is, a zone sizing factor, if specified, replaces the global sizing factor for the named zone.

3.~~~~For some plant components (basically all central chillers, boilers and cooling towers) the user can specify a sizing factor that modifies the autosized component capacity and flow rates. These factors are applied after the application of global or zone sizing factors. They are primarily used to split the design load between multiple components. These sizing factors can change the autosizing of the associated loops and pumps. The following rules are followed the effect of plant component sizing factors on loops and pumps.

a.~~~~For supply side branches, the sizing factors of all components in series on the branch are summed and the result becomes the branch sizing factor. If there is a branch pump its autosized design flow rate is multiplied by the branch sizing factor.

b.~~~For each loop, if the average of the branch sizing factors is less than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the sum of the branch sizing factors. If the average is greater than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the maximum of the branch sizing factors. The loop sizing factor is applied to the loop design flow rate (if autosized) and to the loop pump flow rate (if autosized).

\subsubsection{Mixing User-Specified and Autosized Inputs}\label{mixing-user-specified-and-autosized-inputs}

Mixed user-specified and autosized inputs can be successfully used if the following points and suggestions are followed.

1.~~~~Each component is autosized independently. Thus user input for a flow rate in one component will have no effect on other components' autosized flow rates. For instance, specifying the chilled water loop pump's rated flow rate will have no effect on the autosizing of the chiller's design evaporator flow rate or on the plant loop's autosized maximum loop flow rate.

2.~~~~Within a component it is best to autosize all inputs are enter specified values for all inputs. For example, in a chiller, if only the nominal capaciity is user-specified, the autosized chilled water flow rate may not be consistent with the specified capacity.

3.~~~~Sizing information flows only from the sizing objects to the components. The sizing calculations have no knowledge of user-specified values in a component. The only exception to this rule is that plant loop sizing will collect all component design water flow rates whether autosized or user-specified.

4.~~~~If the user wants to specify a zone or system air flow rate it should be done using the Sizing:Zone and Sizing:System~ objects rather than done in the individual components.

5.~~~~The plant loop flow rates are sized from the total design demand of the components connected to each loop. The components demanding water need not be autosized for the plant loop autosizing to work successfully. So the user could specify all the air side components and autosize all the plant loops and plant components. Or specify the chilled water loop flow rate, chilled water pump inputs and chiller inputs and let the condenser loop and tower autosize.

\subsubsection{Component Sizing Output}\label{component-sizing-output}

The results of the component autosizing calculations are reported on the \emph{eplusout.eio} file. For each component field that has been autosized the object type, object name, field description with unit, and value are printed out as comma separated data on a line beginning with \emph{Component Sizing}. Examples of this are shown in the Output Details and Examples document.

The complete list of objects that have autosized fields is shown in the following table. Note that spaces may be inserted in object names to facilitate readability.

\subsubsection{User or External Zone Design Flow Rate Inputs}\label{user-or-external-zone-design-flow-rate-inputs}

In EnergyPlus the autosizing calculations start with a calculation of the zone design air flow rates using zone by zone design day simulations. The resulting zone design air flow rates and daily air flow sequences are used in the subsequent HVAC and central plant air and fluid flow design calculations and in the component autosizing calculations. The user can override or change the calculated zone design air flow rates in several ways.

1)~~~~The user can enter a value for \emph{Sizing Factor} in the \emph{Sizing:Parameters} object (see description below).

2)~~~~The user can specify a zone level \emph{Zone Sizing Factor} in each \emph{Sizing:Zone} object.

3)~~~~For each zone the user can input a \emph{Cooling Design Air Flow Rate} and/or a \emph{Heating Design Air Flow Rate} (and specify \emph{Cooling Design Air Flow Method = Flow/Zone} and \emph{Heating Design Air Flow Method = Flow/Zone}). These user inputs override the calculated values. The program divides the user input cooling or heating design air flow rate by the calculated values and uses the result as a zone sizing factor to multiply all the elements in the design heating and cooling air flow and load sequences. From this point the design calculations proceed as usual.

\subsubsection{User or External System Design Flow Rate Inputs}\label{user-or-external-system-design-flow-rate-inputs}

Using the results of the zone design air flow rate calculation (including any user input or altered flow rates) EnergyPlus proceeds to calculate central air system flow rates and cooling and heating loads. The results of this calculation can be overridden in the following way.

For each system (AirLoopHVAC), in the corresponding Sizing:System object, specify \emph{Cooling Design Air Flow Method} to be \emph{Flow/System} and input a value for \emph{Cooling Design Air Flow Rate}. Similarly for heating specify \emph{Heating Design Air Flow Method} to be \emph{Flow/System} and input a value for \emph{Heating Design Air Flow Rate}.

\subsection{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir}\label{designspecificationoutdoorair}

This object allows for the outdoor air requirements to be defined in a common location for use by other objects. This object may be referenced by name from other objects (e.g., VAV terminal units, AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled, and AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer) as required to identify an outdoor air quantity for use by that object. Note that a zone name Is not included as an input to this zone outdoor air definition and the number of people in a zone, zone floor area, and zone volume can only be determined after this object has been referenced by another. A single zone outdoor air definition may be referenced by multiple objects to specify that the same outdoor air requirements are used by those objects \emph{or} multiple zone outdoor air objects may be defined and referenced by other objects as needed. If multiple zone outdoor air definitions are used, each outdoor air definition must have a unique name.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-012}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-011}

Unique identifying name. Any reference to this name by other objects will denote that the following outdoor air requirements will be used.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Method}\label{field-outdoor-air-method}

The input must be either \emph{Flow/Person}, \emph{Flow/Area}, \emph{Flow/Zone, AirChanges/Hour}, \emph{Sum}, \emph{Maximum}, \emph{IndoorAirQualityProcedure}, \emph{ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOccupancy}, or \emph{ProportionalControlBasedonOccupancySchedule}. The default is \emph{Flow/Person}.
\begin{itemize} 
\tightlist 

\item  \emph{Flow/Person} means the program will use the input from the field \emph{Outdoor Air Flow per Person} and the actual zone occupancy to calculate a zone outdoor air flow rate.  

\item  \emph{Flow/Area} means that the program will use the input from the field \emph{Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area} and the actual zone floor area as the zone outdoor air flow rate.   
\item  \emph{Flow/Zone} means that the program will use the input of the field \emph{Outdoor Air Flow per Zone} as the zone outdoor air flow rate.   

\item  \emph{AirChanges/Hour} means that the program will use the input from the field \emph{Air Changes per Hour} and the actual zone volume (divided by 3600 seconds per hour) as the zone outdoor air flow rate.  

\item  \emph{Sum} means that the flows calculated from the fields \emph{Outdoor Air Flow per Person,} \emph{Outdoor Air Flow per Area, Outdoor Air Flow per Zone}, and \emph{Air Changes per Hour} (using the associated conversions to m\(^{3}\)/s for each field) will be added to obtain the zone outdoor air flow rate.

\item  \emph{Maximum} means that the maximum flow derived from \emph{Outdoor Air Flow per Person,} \emph{Outdoor Air Flow per Area, Outdoor Air Flow per Zone,} and \emph{Air Changes per Hour} (using the associated conversions to m\(^{3}\)/s for each field) will be used as the zone outdoor air flow rate.
   
\item  \emph{IndoorAirQualityProcedure} means that the program will use the other procedure defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007 to calculate the amount of outdoor air necessary in order to maintain the levels of indoor air carbon dioxide at or below the setpoint defined in the ZoneControl:ContaminantController object. Appendix A of the ASHRAE 62.1-2010 userâ€™s manual discusses another method for implementing CO2-based DCV in a single zone system. The last two methods of Proportional Control calculate the required outdoor air flow rate which varies in proportion to the percentage of the CO2 signal range and has two choices to calculate occupancy-based outdoor air rate. 
  
\item  \emph{ProportionalControlBasedonOccupancySchedule} uses the real occupancy at the current time step to calculate outdoor air rate.

\item  \emph{ProportionalControlBasedonDesignOccupancy} uses the design occupancy level to calculate outdoor air rate. The former choice is a good approach to estimate outdoor air rate. However, for practical applications, the zone controller usually does not have the real time occupancy information, and the design occupancy level is assumed. The latter choice is used in the design stage.

\end{itemize} 


\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Person}\label{field-outdoor-air-flow-per-person}

The design outdoor air volume flow rate per person for this zone in cubic meters per second per person. The default is 0.00944 (20 cfm per person). An outdoor air flow rate is calculated based on the total number of people for all People statements assigned to the zone. Occupancy schedule values \emph{are not} applied during sizing calculations and \emph{are} applied during the remainder of the simulation. This input is used if \emph{Outdoor Air Method} is one of \emph{Outdoor Air Flow per Person}, \emph{Sum}, or \emph{Maximum}.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area}\label{field-outdoor-air-flow-per-zone-floor-area}

The design outdoor air volume flow rate per square meter of floor area (units are m\(^{3}\)/s-m\(^{2}\)). This input is used if \emph{Outdoor Air Method} is \emph{Flow/Area, Sum} or \emph{Maximum}. The default value for this field is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Zone}\label{field-outdoor-air-flow-per-zone}

The design outdoor air flow rate for this zone in cubic meters per second. This input field is used if \emph{Outdoor Air Method} is \emph{Flow/Zone, Sum} or \emph{Maximum}. The default value for this field is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Flow Changes per Hour}\label{field-outdoor-air-flow-changes-per-hour}

The design outdoor air volume flow rate in air changes per hour. This factor is used along with the Zone Volume and converted to cubic meters per second. This input field is used if \emph{Outdoor Air Method} is \emph{AirChanges/Hour, Sum} or \emph{Maximum}. The default value for this field is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Schedule Name}\label{field-outdoor-air-schedule-name}

This field is the name of schedule that defines how outdoor air requirements change over time. The field is optional. If left blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0. If used, then the schedule values are multiplied by the outdoor air flow rate defined by the previous fields. The schedule values must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.  

If this DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir object is referenced by a Controller:MechanicalVentilation object (either directly or indirectly through Sizing:Zone), the schedule will be applied to all types of outdoor air calculations for the corresponding zone, regardless of the System Outdoor Air Method selected. If the schedule value is zero, then the zone will be completely removed from the system outdoor air calculations.

\paragraph{Field: Proportional Control Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate Schedule Name }\label{field-proportional-control-minimum-outdoor-air-flow-rate-schedule-name}

This field is the name of schedule that defines how minimum outdoor air requirements change over time. The field is optional. If left blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0. If used when the field System Outdoor Air Method = ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOARate in Controller:MechanicalVentilation, then the schedule values are multiplied by the outdoor air flow rate.

\subsection{DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution}\label{designspecificationzoneairdistribution}

This object is used to describe the air distribution effectiveness and fraction of secondary recirculation air (return air not directly mixed with outdoor air) of a zone. It is referenced by the Sizing:Zone and Controller:MechanicalVentilation objects.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-011}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-010}

The unique user assigned name for an instance of this object. Any other object referencing this object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness in Cooling Mode}\label{field-zone-air-distribution-effectiveness-in-cooling-mode}

The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in cooling mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness in Heating Mode}\label{field-zone-air-distribution-effectiveness-in-heating-mode}

The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in heating mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values as follows:

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 71
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image133.png}
\caption{Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness (Source: ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010) \protect \label{fig:zone-air-distribution-effectiveness-source}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness Schedule Name}\label{field-zone-air-distribution-effectiveness-schedule-name}

This optional field input points to a schedule with values of zone air distribution effectiveness. It provides a more flexible way of specifying zone air distribution effectiveness if it changes with time and/or system operating status and controls. If the schedule is specified, the zone air distribution effectiveness in cooling mode and heating mode will be ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Secondary Recirculation Fraction}\label{field-zone-secondary-recirculation-fraction}

The non-negative numeric input for this field is the fraction of a zone's recirculation air that does not directly mix with the outdoor air. The zone secondary recirculation fraction Er is determined by the designer based on system configuration. For plenum return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with plenum return) Er is usually less than 1.0, although values may range from 0.1 to 1.2 depending upon the location of the ventilation zone relative to other zones and the air handler. For ducted return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with ducted return), Er is typically 0.0, while for those with system-level recirculation (e.g, dual-fan dual-duct systems with ducted return) Er is typically 1.0. For other system types, Er is typically 0.75. Minimum is 0.0, and default is 0.0 for single-path systems (also to maintain backward compatibility). For parallel fan-powered VAV systems, the secondary ventilation path only functions (Er \textgreater{} 0.0) when the fans in the VAV boxes operate, which is during heating. The local ventilation path and the benefits of secondary recirculation disappear during cooling, when the local parallel fans are off (Er = 0.0).

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Zone Ventilation 
Efficiency}\label{field-minimum-zone-ventilation-efficiency}

This optional input sets a minimum on the ventilation efficiency for the zone. It is only used with the Ventilation Rate Procedure (VRP), single-path method. VRP should be chosen in Sizing System, System Outdoor Air Method = VentilationRateProcedure. Single-path method is indicated by leaving the previous input (Zone Secondary Recirculation Fraction) blank or setting it to 0.0. If the calculated value of ventilation efficiency for a zone is less than this value, it is raised to this minimum by raising the zone minimum air flow rate. This new value for zone minimum air flow rate then overrides other defaults and inputs in Sizing:Zone.

An example of this in an IDF context is shown:

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Sizing:Parameters}\label{sizingparameters}

This object allows the user to specify global heating and cooling sizing ratios. These ratios will be applied at the zone level to all of the zone heating and cooling loads and air flow rates. These new loads and air flow rates are then used to calculate the system level flow rates and capacities and are used in all component sizing calculations.

The user can also specify the width (in load timesteps) of a moving average window which can be used to smooth the calculated zone design flow sequences. The use of this parameter is described below.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-010}

\paragraph{Field: Heating Sizing Factor}\label{field-heating-sizing-factor}

The global heating sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design heating loads and air flow rates.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Sizing Factor}\label{field-cooling-sizing-factor}

The global cooling sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design cooling loads and air flow rates

\paragraph{Field: Timesteps in Averaging Window}\label{field-timesteps-in-averaging-window}

The number of load timesteps in the zone design flow sequence averaging window. The default is 1, in which case the calculated zone design flow rates are averaged over the load timestep.

The zone design air flow rate calculation is performed assuming a potentially infinite supply of heating or cooling air at a fixed temperature. Thus the calculated design air flow rate will always be able to meet any load or change in load no matter how large or abrupt. In reality air flow rates are limited by duct sizes and fan capacities. The idealized zone design flow calculation may result in unrealistically large flow rates, especially if the user is performing the sizing calculations using thermostat schedules with night setup or setback. The calculated zone design flow rates are always averaged over the load timestep. The user may want to perform a broader average to mitigate the effect of thermostat setup and setback and prevent the warm up or cool down flow rates from dominating the design flow rate calculation.. Specifying the width of the averaging window allows the user to do this.

For example, if the load calculation timestep is 15 minutes and the user specifies the \emph{Timesteps in Averaging Window} to be 4, the zone design air flows will be averaged over a time period of 1 hour. Specifying 8 would result in averaging over a 2 hour period.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-009}

The sizing factors and the averaging window size are reported out on the \emph{eplusout.eio} file. An example is:

\begin{lstlisting}

\subsection{OutputControl:Sizing:Style}\label{outputcontrolsizingstyle}

As described early in the document (see: EnergyPlus Output Processing), the user may select the ``style'' for the sizing result files (epluszsz.\textless{}ext\textgreater{}, eplusssz.\textless{}ext\textgreater{}). This object applies to all sizing output files.

\begin{lstlisting}
OutputControl:Sizing:Style,
       \memo default style for the Sizing output files is comma -- this works well for
       \memo importing into spreadsheet programs such as Excel(tm) but not so well for word
       \memo processing progams -- there tab may be a better choice.  fixed puts spaces between
       \memo the "columns"

   A1; \field Column Separator
       \required-field
       \type choice
       \key Comma
       \key Tab
       \key Fixed
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-3-009}

\paragraph{Field: Column Separator}\label{field-column-separator-000}

For this field, the desired separator for columns is entered. ``Comma'' creates comma separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus\textless{}sizing type\textgreater{}.csv files are created). ``Tab'' creates tab separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus\textless{}sizing type\textgreater{}.tab files are created). ``Fixed'' creates space separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus\textless{}sizing type\textgreater{}.txt files are created) but these are not necessarily lined up for easy printing.

Note that both tab and comma separated files easily import into Excel™ or other spreadsheet programs. The tab delimited files can also be viewed by text editors, word processing programs and easily converted to ``tables'' within those programs.

\subsection{Sizing:Zone}\label{sizingzone}

The Sizing:Zone object provides the data needed to perform a zone design air flow calculation for a single zone. This calculation assumes a variable amount of supply air at a fixed temperature and humidity. The information needed consists of the zone inlet supply air conditions: temperature and humidity ratio for heating and cooling. The calculation is done for every design day included in the input. The maximum cooling load and air flow and the maximum heating load and air flow are then saved for the system level design calculations and for the component automatic sizing calculations.

The Sizing:Zone object is also the place where the user can specify the design outdoor air flow rate by referencing the name of a design specification outdoor air object. This can be specified in a number of ways (ref. DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir).This data is saved for use in the system sizing calculation or for sizing zone components that use outdoor air.

The user can also place limits on the heating and design cooling air flow rates. See \emph{~Heating Design Air Flow Method} and \emph{Cooling Design Air Flow Method} below and the explanations of the various heating and cooling flow input fields.

The user can ask the zone design calculation to take into account the effect of a Dedicated Outdoor Air System on the zone design loads and airflow rates. The design calculation will calculate the heat addition rate to the zone of an idealized SOA system and add or subtract the result from the total zone loads and flow rates.

This heat gain is then added to the zone design heat gain for the zone and the zone design air flow rate is adjusted to meet the DOAS heat gain plus the zone design heat gain.

\paragraph{Field: Dedicated Outdoor Air System Control Strategy}\label{field-dedicated-outdoor-air-system-control-strategy}

This is a choice field with a choice of three ideal control strategies for the DOA system. The choices are \emph{NeutralSupplyAir}, \emph{NeutralDehumidifiedSupplyAir}, or \emph{ColdSupplyAir}. The default is \emph{NeutralSupplyAir}.

\emph{NeutralSupplyAir} implies that the ventilation air supplied to the zone will cause little heating or cooling. The air will be heated or cooled to keep it between the low and high temperature setpoints specified in the subsequent two fields. A good choice for these fields might be 21.1 and 23.9 degrees C.

\emph{NeutralDehumidifiedSupplyAir} means that the ventilation air will be cooled and dehumidified and then reheated to a neutral temperature. The ventilation air is cooled to the lower setpoint temperature (if necessary) and reheated to the upper setpoint temperature. A good choice for the setpoints would be 14.4 and 22.2 degrees C.

\emph{ColdSupplyAir} means that the ventilation air will be used to supply cooling to the zone. Cold outside air is heated to the upper setpoint; warm outside air is cooled to the lower setpoint. A good choice for the setpoints would be 12.2 and 14.4 degrees C.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-1-007}

The zone design air flow rates and loads are output onto the local file ``epluszsz.\textless{}ext\textgreater{}'' where \textless{}ext\textgreater{} is the extension from the sizing style object (default is csv -- a comma separated file \emph{epluszsz.csv)}.

The values are printed out for each zone as comma separated records beginning with \emph{Zone Sizing}. Items output on the \emph{eio} file are: zone name, load type (heating or cooling), design load, calculated design air flow rate, user design air flow rate, design day name, time of peak, outside temperature at peak, outside humidity ratio at peak.

\subsection{DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing}\label{designspecificationzonehvacsizing}

This object is used to describe general sizing and scalable sizing methods which are referenced by zone HVAC equipment objects. It is optional input field in zone HVAC objects. If a name of this optional input is not specified or is blank then the sizing method or input specified in the parent object is used.~ If the name of this object is entered, then the values or method specified overrides the sizing method in the parent zone HVAC objects. This object is meant to provide scalable sizing method to users. The name of this object is an optional input field in the zoneHVAC objects. When this name in not specified in the zone HVAC object the sizing method or the value specified in the zone HVAC object will be used.

List of zoneHVAC objects than can reference this object include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow
\item
  ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner
\item
  ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump
\item
  ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump
\item
  ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner
\item
  ZoneHVAC:UnitHeater
\item
  ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator
\item
  ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil
\item
  ZoneHVAC:VentilatedSlab
\item
  ZoneHVAC:EvaporativeCoolerUnit
\item
  ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem
\end{itemize}

The sizing methods input fields available in this objects are for supply air flow and capacity for heating and cooling operating modes. Some zone HVAC equipment has single supply air flow rate input field that serves both cooling and heating operating modes.~ So entering either of the cooling or heating scalable sizing input field is sufficient.~ When there are separate input fields for cooling, heating, no-cooling, and no-heating operating modes, the corresponding input fields are specified.~ The child components supply air flow rate are also sized using scalable sizing methods specified in the parent objects. The methods allow users to enter a fixed or hard sized values, autosizable, or scalable sizing methods.~ Methods allowed for sizing supply air flow rates include: \emph{SupplyAirFlowRate}, \emph{FractionOfAutosizedCoolingAirflow}, \emph{FractionOfAutosizedHeatingAirflow}, \emph{FlowPerFloorArea, FlowPerCoolingCapacity}, and \emph{FlowPerHeatingCapacity}.~ The different sizing options are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{SupplyAirFlowRate}: entered when it is intended that the user specified either hard value or the simulation engine autosize the supply air flow rates for cooling, heating, and no-cooling or no-heating operating modes.
\item
  \textbf{FlowPerFloorArea}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determine the supply air flow rates from the user specified \emph{supply air flow rates per unit floor area} and the zone floor area of the zone served by the zone HVAC equipment.
\item
  \textbf{FractionOfAutosizedCoolingAirflow}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified \emph{flow fraction} and \emph{autosized cooling design supply air flow rate}.
\item
  \textbf{FractionOfAutosizedHeatingAirflow}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified \emph{flow fraction} and \emph{autosized heating design supply air flow rate}.
\item
  \textbf{FlowPerCoolingCapacity}: entered when it is intended t that he simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified \emph{supply air flow per cooling capacity value} and \emph{autosized cooling design capacity}.
\item
  \textbf{FlowPerHeatingCapacity}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified \emph{supply air flow per heating capacity value} and \emph{autosized heating design capacity}.
\end{itemize}

The~ Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing object also has input fields for sizing or scalable sizing of cooling and heating capacity. However, most of the parent zone HVAC objects do not have input fields for sizing capacities. So, the capacity scalable sizing fields in the parent objects are used for sizing child components capacity sizings.~ The scalable capacity sizing may be indirectly impacted by the scalable supply air flow rates sizing values. Moreover, the autosized cold water, hot water and steam flow rates in the parent zone HVAC objects (e.g.~FanCoils, UnitHeaters, UnitVentilators, and VentilatedSlabs) and capacity in child components are determined using the scalable sizing methods.~ Sizing methods allowed for cooling and heating capacity include: \emph{CoolingDesignCapacity, HeatingDesignCapacity}, \emph{CapacityPerFloorArea, FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity}, \emph{FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{CoolingDesignCapacity}: entered when it is intended that user specifies either a hard sized cooling capacity value or the simulation engine autosizes cooling capacity value for the cooling design capacity.
\item
  \textbf{HeatingDesignCapacity}: entered when it is intended that user specifies either a hard sized heating capacity value or the simulation engine autosized heating capacity value for the heating design capacity.
\item

\subsection{Sizing:System}\label{sizingsystem}

The Sizing:System object contains the input needed to perform a central forced air system design air flow, heating capacity, and cooling capacity calculation for a system serving one or more zones. The information needed consists of the outside environmental conditions and the design supply air temperatures, outdoor air flow rate, and minimum system air flow ratio.

The outside conditions come from the design days in the input. A system sizing calculation is performed for every design day in the input file and the resulting maximum heating and cooling air flow rates and capacities are saved for use in the component sizing calculations.

Supply air conditions are specified by inputting a supply air temperature for cooling, a supply air temperature for heating, and a preheat temperature.

The system sizing calculation sums the zone design air flow rates to obtain a system supply air flow rate. The design conditions and the outdoor air flow rate are used to calculate a design mixed air temperature. The temperature plus the design supply air temperatures allows the calculation of system design heating and cooling capacities.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-6-006}

\paragraph{Field: AirLoop Name}\label{field-airloop-name}

The name of the AirLoopHVAC corresponding to this Sizing:System object. This is the air system for which the design calculation will be made using the input data of this Sizing:System Object.

\paragraph{Field: Type of Load to Size On}\label{field-type-of-load-to-size-on}

The user specified type of load on which to size the central system. The choices are \emph{Sensible}, \emph{Total} and \emph{VentilationRequirement}. \emph{Sensible} and \emph{Total} mean that the central system supply air flow rate will be determined by combining the zone design air flow rates, which have been calculated to meet the zone sensible loads from the design days. \emph{VentilationRequirement} means that the central system supply air flow rate will be determined by the system ventilation requirement. In addition \emph{Sensible} tells the program to size the central cooling coil using entering air flow rate and air conditions at the sensible load peak; \emph{Total} indicates that the program should size the central cooling coil at the air flow rate and conditions at the total load peak. The central heating coil is always sized at the conditions at the peak sensible heating load.

\paragraph{Field: Design Outdoor Air Flow Rate}\label{field-design-outdoor-air-flow-rate}

The design outdoor air flow rate in cubic meters per second. Generally this should be the minimum outdoor air flow. It is used for both heating and cooling design calculations. The assumption for cooling is that any outdoor air economizer will be closed. If \emph{Autosize} is input the outdoor air flow rate will be taken from the sum of the zone outdoor air flow rates or calculated based on the System Outdoor Air Method selection (field below).

\paragraph{Field: Central Heating Maximum System Air Flow Ratio}\label{field-central-heating-maximum-system-air-flow-ratio}

The ratio of the maximum system air flow rate for heating to the maximum system air flow rate. The value must be between 0 and 1. For constant volume systems the ratio should be set to 1. This ratio should be set to reflect what the user expects the system flow rate to be when maximum heating demand occurs. This ratio is used in calculating the central system heating capacity. Thus if the system is VAV with the zone VAV dampers held at minimum flow when there is a zone heating demand, this ratio should be set to the minimum flow ratio. If the zone VAV dampers are reverse action and can open to full flow to meet heating demand, this ratio should be set to 1. The default is set to 0.5, reflecting the fact that VAV dampers are typically not allowed to fully open during heating.

This field can be set to \emph{AutoSize}.  When automatically calculated, the ratio is determined from the system heating design flow rate divided by the main (which is usually the max of heating and cooling design flow rates) design flow rate.  The design flow rates are also adjusted to be more accurate by examining each of the air terminals attached to the air system and summing the heating and maximum flow rates.

It should be the temperature at the exit of the main heating coil. This value is also used for the sizing of zone equipment (e.g., reheat coil) for the system embedded with central heating coils, but it is not used if there is no central heating coil in the system.

\paragraph{Field: Type of Zone Sum to Use}\label{field-type-of-zone-sum-to-use}

This information is initially used by components that use water for heating or cooling such as hot or chilled water coils to calculate their maximum water flow rates.

This field is optional. This field controls how concurrence issues impact the plant loop design flow rate. If it is not used then the program uses noncoincident method, which is the historical behavior prior to version 8.3. There are two choices, noncoincident and coincident. The use of Coincident sizing option requires that the SimulationControl object be set to YES for the input field called Do HVAC Sizing Simulation for Sizing Periods.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Timesteps in Averaging Window}\label{field-zone-timesteps-in-averaging-window}

This field is optional and is only used if the preceding field is set to Coincident. This is the number of zone timesteps used in a moving average to determine the design flow rate from HVAC Sizing Simulation approach. This allows using a broader average over time when using coincident plant sizing. This is similar in concept to the similar field in Sizing:Parameters which specifies the averaging window for zone loads. The default is 1.

\paragraph{Field: Coincident Sizing Factor Mode}\label{field-coincident-sizing-factor-mode}

This field is only used if the sizing option is set to Coincident. This field controls the behavior of coincident sizing with respect to what, if any, sizing factor should be applied to further modify the flow rate measured while running HVAC Sizing Simulations. There are four options. Enter the keword None to use the raw value for flow rate without modification. Enter the keyword GlobalHeatingSizingFactor to modify the flow by the sizing factor entered in the object called Sizing:Parameters for heating. Enter the keyword GlobalCoolingSizingFactor to modify the flow by the sizing factor entered in the object called Sizing:Parameters for cooling. Enter the keyword LoopComponentSizingFactor to modify the flow by a sizing factor determined from the combination of component-level sizing factors in the associated plant loop.

An IDF example:

\begin{lstlisting}

Sizing:Plant,
     Chilled Water Loop, ! name of loop
     Cooling,            ! type of loop
     7.22,               ! chilled water supply temperature
     6.67,               ! chilled water delta T
  NonCoincident,      !- Sizing Option
  1,                  !- Zone Timesteps in Averaging Window
  GlobalCoolingSizingFactor; !- Coincident Sizing Factor Mode
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-3-004}

The loop flow rates are reported on the \emph{eplusout.eio} file along with the component sizing results.

When coincident plant sizing method is used, the eio file contains special summary report with various details and interim values from the calculations, under the following record header: ! , Plant Loop Name, Sizing Pass \{\#\}, Measured Mass Flow\{kg/s\}, Measured Demand \{W\}, Demand Calculated Mass Flow\{kg/s\}, Sizes Changed \{Yes/No\}, Previous Volume Flow Rate \{m3/s\}, New Volume Flow Rate \{m3/s\}, Demand Check Applied \{Yes/No\}, Sizing Factor \{\}, Normalized Change \{\}, Specific Heat\{\}.
