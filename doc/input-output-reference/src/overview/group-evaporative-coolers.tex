\section{Group Evaporative Coolers}\label{group-evaporative-coolers}

This group of objects describes the properties and configuration for the evaporative coolers models for the HVAC section.

\subsection{EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad}\label{evaporativecoolerdirectceldekpad}

The direct stage, shown in the figure below, consists of a rigid media evaporative pad, with water recirculated from a reservoir. The water is pumped from the reservoir to a water distribution header, for water feed by gravity from above the media. The evaporative pad provides the area for the adiabatic saturation of the air. While the process provides a lower dry-bulb temperature, the moisture content of the leaving air is higher than the entering condition. The direct stage is used for comfort cooling in a building where adding humidity to the air can be tolerated.

\caption{Direct Stage Evaporative Cooler \protect \label{fig:direct-stage-evaporative-cooler}}
\end{figure}

The thermodynamic process is a simultaneous heat and mass transfer, or adiabatic cooling, and follows a constant enthalpy line on the psychrometric chart, it is shown in the figure below as a process from A to B. Since the deviation of the constant wet-bulb line and the constant enthalpy line is small, it is assumed that the wet-bulb temperature is constant across the direct evaporative stage.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 145

\caption{Psychrometric Chart -- Constant Enthalpy \protect \label{fig:psychrometric-chart-constant-enthalpy}}
\end{figure}

If the direct evaporative process were 100\% efficient, the leaving dry-bulb temperature would equal the entering wet-bulb temperature. The efficiency of the direct evaporative process is less than 100\% and by defining saturation efficiency (\(\varepsilon\) se) for the direct stage or evaporative pad, the leaving dry-bulb temperature can be expressed by the following equation.

\begin{equation}
{T_{db\,supout}} = {T_{db\,sup\,in}} - {\varepsilon_{se}}\cdot \left( {{T_{db\,sup\,in}} - {T_{wb\,sup\,in}}} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{EvaporativeCooler:Direct:ResearchSpecial}\label{evaporativecoolerdirectresearchspecial}

This cooler is similar in principal to the EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad. The model differs in that it gives the user a simple way of specify the cooler effectiveness. Using the ResearchSpecial input object also allows the cooler to control the amount of cooling based on node setpoints (controlled by SetpointManagers). This avoid problems from over cooling when conditions are such that loads are low and cooling power is high.

The model allows to vary the effectiveness depending on the primary air flow rates. The design effectiveness is modified by multiplying with Effectiveness Flow Fraction Modifier Curve value. The flow fraction is the ratio of the current primary airflow rate to the design flow rate. The recirculating and spray water pump power is assumed to vary with the primary air flow. The design pump power is modified using user specified pump modifier curve value. The normalized pump power modifier curve is a function of primary air flow fraction as a independent variable.

Also the direct evaporative cooler operating range can be controlled depending on the entering air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. The operating range controlled based on minimum and maximum inlet node air temperature limits. The evaporative cooler can be turned on or off depending user specified minimum and maximum temperature limits. If the inlet node entering air temperature is lower or higher than the minimum and maximum limits, respectively, then the direct research special evaporative cooler is turned off. If these two input fields are left blank then, no user specified operating temperature control is applied. Operating range control feature is primarily intended for application in data centers.

However, if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains.

\paragraph{Field: Drift Loss Fraction}\label{field-drift-loss-fraction}

This field is optional and can be used to model additional water consumed by the cooler from drift. Drift is water that leaves the cooling media as droplets and does not evaporate into the process air stream.

Blowdown is water that is intentionally drained from the cooler s sump to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values are 3 to 5. The default is 3.0.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Cooler Operation Minimum Drybulb Temperature}\label{field-evaporative-cooler-operation-minimum-drybulb-temperature}

The evaporative cooler will be turned off when evaporator cooler air inlet node dry-bulb temperature falls below this value. The typical minimum value is \SI{16}{\celsius}.

\subsection{EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad}\label{evaporativecoolerindirectceldekpad}

The dry coil indirect evaporative cooler, shown in the figure below, has a rigid media pad, similar to the direct evaporative stage, where the adiabatic cooling takes place. The secondary air leaves the rigid media pad and enters an air to air heat exchanger where it cools the supply air flowing through the heat exchanger tubes. The moist secondary air is then exhausted to the environment. The secondary air stream has its own fan and consists of a rigid media evaporative pad, with water recirculated from a reservoir. The water is pumped from the reservoir to a water distribution header, for water feed by gravity from above the media. The evaporative pad provides the area for the adiabatic saturation of the air.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 146
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image419.png}
\caption{Evaporative Cooler -- Indirect Dry Coil \protect \label{fig:evaporative-cooler-indirect-dry-coil}}
\end{figure}

The process that the secondary air goes through, A to C to D, is shown by the dashed lines in the following figure. Process A to C is adiabatic cooling in the rigid media pad. Then the air enters the shell side of the heat exchanger and is sensibly heated from C to D by the warm supply air passing through the tube side. The secondary air inlet is modeled as a separate stream of outdoor air and the user has the option of defining the name of an outdoor air node.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 147
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image420.png}
\caption{Secondary Air Process -- Indirect Dry Coil Evap Cooler \protect \label{fig:secondary-air-process-indirect-dry-coil-evap}}
\end{figure}

The advantage of the dry coil heat exchanger is that the heat exchanger does not have the evaporation taking place on the outside of the tubes, thus no mineral deposits are left on the heat exchange surface to reduce the efficiency of the heat exchanger. The rigid media pads are designed to flush the mineral deposits to the sump, so the saturation efficiency of the pad stays relatively constant.

The dry evaporation saturation efficiency is the saturation efficiency of the secondary or wet side air stream defined as the temperature change of the supply air divided by the difference between the outdoor dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures. In other words, it is a measure of the approach to the outdoor wet-bulb temperature.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Total Stage Effectiveness}\label{evaporative-cooler-total-stage-effectiveness}

The total stage efficiency includes the sensible heat exchanger effectiveness of the heat exchanger in the supply air stream. It is the saturation efficiency multiplied by the heat exchanger effectiveness.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Electric Power{[}W{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-electric-powerw-2}

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-electric-energy-j-2}

These output variables report the electric power and energy consumed by the secondary air fan and the sump pump.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Water Volume{[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-water-volumem3}

The water consumption is the water evaporated from the pad. This water consumption is only from the direct thermodynamics of water evaporation and does not include other sources of consumption such as drift or concentration blow down. This output variable appears when mains water is supplied to the cooler.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Mains Water Volume {[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-mains-water-volume-m3-2}

This is the source of the water consumed. This output variable appears when mains water is supplied to the cooler.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Storage Tank Water Volume {[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-storage-tank-water-volume-m3-2}

The water consumption is the water evaporated from the pad. This water consumption is only from the direct thermodynamics of water evaporation and does not include other sources of consumption such as drift or concentration blow down. This output variable appears when storage tank water is supplied to the cooler.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Starved Water Volume {[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-starved-water-volume-m3-2}

This is the water consumed by the evaporative cooler that could not accually be met by the storage tank. This output variable appears when storage tank water is supplied to the cooler.

\subsection{EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil}\label{evaporativecoolerindirectwetcoil}

The wetted coil evaporative cooler shown in the figure below, has water sprayed directly on the tubes of the heat exchanger where latent cooling takes place. The vaporization of the water on the outside of the heat exchanger tubes allows the simultaneous heat and mass transfer which removes heat from the supply air on the tube side. Then the moist secondary air is exhausted. The secondary air stream has its own fan.

\caption{Evaporative Cooler Indirect Wet Coil \protect \label{fig:evaporative-cooler-indirect-wet-coil}}
\end{figure}

The process that the secondary air goes through, A to C on the following figure, is a path of simultaneous heat and mass transfer, but it does not follow a line of constant enthalpy as in the direct stage. The process is not adiabatic due to the heat gain from the supply air flowing through the tubes of the heat exchanger.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 149

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image422.png}
\caption{Secondary Air Process Indirect Wet Coil Evap Cooler \protect \label{fig:secondary-air-process-indirect-wet-coil-evap}}
\end{figure}

The wet coil heat exchanger can have a higher stage efficiency than the dry coil due to a higher heat transfer rate on the outside of the heat exchanger tubes. Over the operating lifetime of the heat exchanger, the vaporization taking place on the heat exchange surface can leave mineral deposits which will decrease the effectiveness of the heat exchanger.

A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the evaporative cooler can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Coil Maximum Efficiency}\label{field-coil-maximum-efficiency}

The maximum efficiency of the stage is a combination of the efficiency due to the simultaneous heat and mass transfer on the outside of the tube and the efficiency of the heat exchanger. This value can be higher than the dry coil overall efficiency since the convective coefficients on the outside of the tube are larger.

\paragraph{Field: Coil Flow Ratio}\label{field-coil-flow-ratio}

The Coil Flow Ratio is determined from performance data. The Coil Flow Ratio tells how quickly the efficiency of the stage would decrease with a mismatch of the supply and secondary flows.

This value is the overall efficiency of the fan, i.e., the ratio of the power delivered to the fluid to the electrical input power. It is the product of the motor efficiency and the impeller efficiency. The motor efficiency is the power delivered to the shaft divided by the electrical power input to the motor. The impeller efficiency is power delivered to the fluid (air) divided by the shaft power.

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains.

\paragraph{Field: Secondary Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-secondary-air-inlet-node-name-1-000}

This field is optional. It is used to explicitly define an outdoor air node for the inlet for secondary air stream. Defining an outdoor air node here allows using the height-dependent model for outdoor air conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Drift Loss Fraction}\label{field-drift-loss-fraction-1}

This field is optional and can be used to model additional water consumed by the cooler from drift. Drift is water that leaves the cooling media as droplets and does not evaporate into the process air stream. For example, water may get blown off the evaporative media by winds and escape the air system. The value entered here is a simple fraction of the water consumed by the cooler for normal process evaporation. The amount of drift is this fraction times the water evaporated for the normal cooling process. This field can be left blank and then there will be no added water consumption from drift.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio}\label{field-blowdown-concentration-ratio-1-000}

This field is optional and can be used to model additional water consumed by the cooler from blowdown. Blowdown is water that is intentionally drained from the cooler s sump to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values are 3 to 5. The default is 3.0.

\subsection{EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:ResearchSpecial}\label{evaporativecoolerindirectresearchspecial}

This cooler is similar in principal to the EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad and EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil (see Figure~\ref{fig:secondary-air-process-indirect-dry-coil-evap}, Figure~\ref{fig:evaporative-cooler-indirect-wet-coil}, and Figure~\ref{fig:secondary-air-process-indirect-wet-coil-evap}). The model differs in that it gives the user more flexibility to specify the source of secondary air. The cooler effectiveness with respect to wetbulb depression is allowed to go beyond 1.0. Using the ResearchSpecial input object also allows the cooler to control the amount of cooling based on node setpoints (controlled by SetpointManagers). This avoid problems from over cooling when conditions are such that loads are low and cooling power is high. Fan power is assumed to vary linearly when the cooler is operating at less than full capacity.

The indirect evaporative cooler research special calculation procedure allows accounting for dry and wet effectiveness value variation with flow fraction. Two effectiveness modifier curves are included as optional user inputs for this purpose. Effectiveness modifier curves operate on the design dry and wet effectiveness values. The flow fraction is calculated as a ratio of the sum of current primary and secondary air flow rates to the sum of the design flow rates. Model also accounts for fan and recirculation water pump power variation with secondary air flow rates using pump power modifying curve. The fan power is calculated by multiplying the design fan power using fan power modify curve value evaluated at current secondary air flow fraction. Similarly, recirculating pump power is is calculated by multiplying the design pump power by pump power modifier curve value evaluated at current secondary air flow fraction. If the secondary air fan and recirculating pump power modifier curves are not specified, then fan and pump power are assumed to vary linearly with part load fraction.

If this field is left blank, then there is no drybulb temperature lower limit for evaporative cooler operation. If operating range control is desired then this input field and the next two input fields should be specified or all the three should be left blank or left out. If no minimum drybulb temperature limit is required while there are maximum drybulb and wetbulb temperature limits then specify very low temperature limit value (e.g., -99.0 C).

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Total Stage Effectiveness {[]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-total-stage-effectiveness-2}

The Total Stage Efficiency is defined as the temperature change of the supply air divided by the difference between the primary air entering dry-bulb temperature and the secondary air enterig wet-bulb temperature for wet operating mode or the the difference between the primary air entering dry-bulb temperature and the secondary air enterig dry-bulb temperature for dry operating mode, including the effect of the reduction in flow because of the secondary air stream. In other words, it is a measure of the approach to the secondary air wet-bulb temperature for wet operating mode, or it is a measure of the approach to the secondary air entering dry-bulb temperature for dry operating mode.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Operating Mode Status {[]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-operating-mode-status}

This output variable provides the operating modes or status of the indirect evaporative cooler. This output variable can have status indicator integer value of 0, 1, or 2 representing Off, Dry and Wet operating modes, respectively.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Part Load Ratio {[]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-part-load-ratio}

This output variable provides the part load fraction of the indirect cooler. The ResearchSpecial cooler model is able to modulate to meet a temperature set point to avoid over cooling. This output variable is the fraction formed by the ratio of the capacity needed over the maximum cooling capacity available. A value of 1.0 corresponds to full capacity cooling.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Dewpoint Bound Status {[]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-dewpoint-bound-status}

This output variable is a flag that indicates if the modeling was based on dewpoint effectivenss rather than wetbulb effectiveness The ResearchSpecial model is usually based on wet-bulb approach, but since values in excess of 1.0 are allowed, there is a secondary constraint imposed by dewpoint. If the dewpoint effectiveness was applied, then this flag variable will have the value 1.0, otherwise it is 0.0.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-electric-power-w-1}

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Electric Energy {[}J{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-electric-energy-j-4}

These output variables report the electric power and energy that are consumed by the secondary air fan and the sump pump.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Water Volume {[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-water-volume-m3-3}

The water consumption is the water evaporated from the pad. This water consumption is only from the direct thermodynamics of water evaporation and does not include other sources of consumption such as drift or concentration blow down. This output variable appears when mains water is supplied to the cooler.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Mains Water Volume {[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-mains-water-volume-m3-4}

This is the source of the water consumed. This output variable appears when mains water is supplied to the cooler.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Storage Tank Water Volume {[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-storage-tank-water-volume-m3-4}

The water consumption is the water evaporated from the pad. This water consumption is only from the direct thermodynamics of water evaporation and does not include other sources of consumption such as drift or concentration blow down. This output variable appears when storage tank water is supplied to the cooler.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Starved Water Volume {[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-starved-water-volume-m3-4}

This is the water consumed by the evaporative cooler that could not accually be met by the storage tank. This output variable appears when storage tank water is supplied to the cooler.

\paragraph{Evaporative Cooler Starved Mains Water Volume {[}m3{]}}\label{evaporative-cooler-starved-mains-water-volume-m3-4}

This is the source (mains) of water consumed by the evaporative cooler that could not accually be met by the storage tank. This output variable appears when storage tank water is supplied to the cooler.
