\sectionmark{Group -- Internal Gains}

Not all the influence for energy consumption in the building is due to envelope and ambient conditions. This group of objects describes other internal gains that may come into play (People, Lights, Various Equipment Types).

\subsection{People}\label{people}

The people statement is used to model the occupant's effect on the space conditions. The following definition addresses the basic affects as well as providing information that can be used to report the thermal comfort of a group of occupants. The Fanger, Pierce Two-Node, and Kansas State University Two-Node thermal comfort models are available in EnergyPlus. A user may select any of these models for each People statement by simply adding the appropriate choice keyword after the air velocity schedule name. Thermal comfort calculations will only be made for people statements that include specific requests for these thermal comfort models. . This object also requires input of carbon dioxide generation rate based on people activity level for zone carbon dioxide simulations.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-025}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-024}

The name of the People object. Must be unique across all People objects.

\paragraph{Field: Zone or ZoneList Name}\label{field-zone-or-zonelist-name-000}

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) or ZoneList (ref: ZoneList) and links a particular people statement to a thermal zone or set of thermal zones in the building. When the ZoneList option is used then this people definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for the number of people in the zone. The Zonelist option can be used effectively with the people/area and area/person options of the Number of People Calculation Method.

The name of the actual people object becomes \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{} \textless{}People Object Name\textgreater{} and should be less than the standard length (100 characters) for a name field. If it is greater than this standard length, it may be difficult to specify in output reporting as it will be truncated. A warning will be shown if the generated name is greater than 100 characters. If it duplicates another such concatenated name, there will be a severe error and terminate the run.

\paragraph{Field: Number of People Schedule Name}\label{field-number-of-people-schedule-name}

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedules) that modifies the number of people parameter (see Number of People Calculation Method and related fields). The schedule values can be any positive number. The actual number of people in a zone as defined by this statement is the product of the number of people field and the value of the schedule specified by name in this field.

\paragraph{Field: Number of People Calculation Method}\label{field-number-of-people-calculation-method}

This field is a key/choice field that tells which of the next three fields are filled and is descriptive of the method for calculating the nominal number of occupants (people) in the Zone. The key/choices are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  People
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a straight insertion of the number of occupants (people).~ (The Number of People field should be filled.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  People/Area
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor per floor area of the zone. (The People per Zone Floor Area field should be filled).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Area/Person
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor of floor area per person. (The Zone Floor Area per Person field should be filled).

\paragraph{Field: Number of People}\label{field-number-of-people}

This field is used to represent the maximum number of people in a zone that is then multiplied by a schedule fraction (see schedule field). In EnergyPlus, this is slightly more flexible in that the number of people could be a ``diversity factor'' applied to a schedule of real numbers. Note that while the schedule value can vary from hour to hour, the number of people field is constant for all simulation environments.

\paragraph{Field: People per Zone Floor Area}\label{field-people-per-zone-floor-area}

This factor (person/m\(^{2}\)) is used, along with the Zone Floor Area to determine the maximum number of people as described in the Number of People field. The choice from the method field should be ``people/area''.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Floor Area per Person}\label{field-zone-floor-area-per-person}

This factor (m\(^{2}\)/person) is used, along with the Zone Floor Area to determine the maximum number of people as described in the Number of People field. The choice from the method field should be ``area/person''.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Radiant}\label{field-fraction-radiant}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the type of heat being given off by people in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total sensible energy emitted by people to give the amount of long wavelength radiation gain from human beings in a zone. The remainder of the sensible load is assumed to be convective heat gain. Note that latent gains from people are not included in either the radiant or convective heat gains. See the Engineering Reference document for more details. Default value is 0.30.

\paragraph{Field: Sensible Heat Fraction}\label{field-sensible-heat-fraction}

The user can use this field to specify a fixed sensible fraction for the heat gain due to this PEOPLE object. Normally the program calculates the sensible/latent split; this field gives the user control over this split. This field is autocalculated: if the field is blank or \textbf{autocalculate}, the program will calculate the sensible/latent split; if a value is entered, it will be used as the sensible fraction of the current total heat gain.

\paragraph{Field: Activity Level Schedule Name}\label{field-activity-level-schedule-name}

This field is the name of the schedule that determines the amount of heat gain per person in the zone under design conditions. This heat gain impacts the basic zone heat balance as well as the modeling of thermal comfort. This value is modified somewhat based on a correlation to account for variations in space temperature. The schedule values may be any positive number and the units for this parameter is Watts per person. This schedule represents the total heat gain per person including convective, radiant, and latent. An internal algorithm is used to determine what fraction of the total is sensible and what fraction is latent. Then, the sensible portion is divided into radiant and convective portions using the value specified for Fraction Radiant (above). See the Engineering Reference document for more details.

Values for activity level can range anywhere from approximately 100-150 Watts per person for most office activities up to over 900 Watts per person for strenuous physical activities such as competitive wrestling. The following table (Table~\ref{table:metabolic-rates-for-various-activities}) is based on Table~\ref{table:wind-speed-profile-coefficients-ashrae} from the 2005 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, page 8.6. In addition to the information from the ASHRAE HOF, there is an added column of values in W/Person such as necessary for the activity level schedule values. This column uses the standard adult body surface area of 1.8 m\(^{2}\) to multiply the activity levels in W/m\(^{2}\) that are used in the table. Warnings are produced when the activity level schedule values fall outside normal ranges. Having too low or too high values can also skew thermal comfort reporting values.

\paragraph{Field: Carbon Dioxide Generation Rate}\label{field-carbon-dioxide-generation-rate}

This numeric input field specifies carbon dioxide generation rate per person with units of m3/s-W. The total carbon dioxide generation rate from this object is:

Number of People * People Schedule * People Activity * Carbon Dioxide Generation Rate. The default value is 3.82E-8 m3/s-W (obtained from ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007 value at 0.0084 cfm/met/person over the general adult population). The maximum value can be 10 times the default value.

\paragraph{Field: Enable ASHRAE 55 comfort warnings}\label{field-enable-ashrae-55-comfort-warnings}

This field accepts either ``Yes'' or ``No'' as values. When ``Yes'' is specified, warnings are generated when the space conditions are outside of the ASHRAE 55 comfort range as discussed in the sections that follow titled ``Simplified ASHRAE 55-2004 Graph Related Outputs'' and ``Simplified ASHRAE 55 Warnings.'' The default is not to provide these warnings so if you want to know if your space is outside this comfort range you must set this field to Yes.

\paragraph{Field: Mean Radiant Temperature Calculation Type}\label{field-mean-radiant-temperature-calculation-type}

This field specifies the type of Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) calculation the user wishes to use for the thermal comfort model. At the present time, there are three options for MRT calculation type: zone averaged, surface weighted, and a list of angle factors. The default calculation is ``ZoneAveraged'' and is used if field is left blank. In the zone averaged MRT calculation, the MRT used for the thermal comfort calculations is for an ``average'' point in the zone. MRT is calculated based on an area-emissivity weighted average of all of the surfaces in the zone. In cases where the emissivity of all of the surfaces are sufficiently small (near zero), the mean radiant temperature will be set to the mean air temperature of the space to avoid divide by zero errors. The other MRT calculation type is ``SurfaceWeighted''. The goal of this calculation type is to estimate a person in the space close to a particular surface without having to define exact view factors for all of the surfaces and the location of the person in the space. The MRT used in the thermal comfort calculations when the ``surface weighted'' calculation type is selected is actually the average of the temperature of the surface to which the person is closest (defined by the next field ``Surface Name'') and the zone averaged MRT (defined above). The surface temperature alone is not used because in theory the maximum view factor from a person to any flat surface is roughly 0.5. In the ``surfaceweighted'' calculation, the surface in question actually gets slightly more weighting than 50\% since the surface selected is still a part of the zone average MRT calculation. Again, this simplification was made to avoid the specification of view factors and the exact location of the person.

A third option is to use ``AngleFactor''. This option allows for more explicit positioning of the person within the space by defining the angle factors from the person to the various surfaces in the zone. This option requires the user to list the surfaces that the person can see from a radiation standpoint and also define the angle (or view) factor for each surface. The ComfortViewFactorAngles object (see next object description) is intended to give the user this opportunity.

\paragraph{Field: Surface Name/Angle Factor List Name}\label{field-surface-nameangle-factor-list-name}

This field is only valid when the user selects ``SurfaceWeighted'' or ``AngleFactor'' for the MRT calculation type (see the previous input field description). In the case of ``SurfaceWeighted'', the field is the name of a surface within the zone the people are residing. This surface will be used in the MRT calculation as defined above to come up with a more representative MRT for a person near a particular surface. The MRT used for thermal comfort calculations using the ``SurfaceWeighted'' MRT calculation method is the average of the temperature of the surface specified in this field and the ``zone averaged'' MRT (see the Mean Radiant Temperature calculation type field above). In the case of ``AngleFactor'', the field is the name of a ComfortViewFactorAngles input object defined elsewhere. This field is required when the previous field is set to ``SurfaceWeighted'' or ``AngleFactor'' and is set to run one of the following thermal comfort models: Fanger, Pierce, or KSU.

\paragraph{Field: Work Efficiency Schedule Name}\label{field-work-efficiency-schedule-name}

This field is the name of the schedule that determines the efficiency of energy usage within the human body that will be used for thermal comfort calculations. Note that all energy produced by the body is assumed to be converted to heat for the zone heat balance calculation. A value of zero corresponds to all of the energy produced in the body being converted to heat. A value of unity corresponds to all of the energy produced in the body being converted to mechanical energy. The values for this parameter defined in the schedule must be between 0.0 and 1.0. Any value greater than zero will result in a reduction of heat that impacts the thermal comfort energy balance of a person within the space, resulting in PMV results appearing lower than expected.~ Ensure that if this value is non-zero, the base activity level is chosen to ensure that the net activity converted to heat and zone conditions are sufficient to maintain thermal comfort. This field is required to run one of the following thermal comfort models: Fanger, Pierce, or KSU. 

\paragraph{Field: Clothing Insulation Calculation Method}\label{field-clothing-insulation-calculation-method}

This field is a key/choice field that tells which of the next two fields are filled and is descriptive of the method for calculating the clothing insulation value of occupants (people) in the Zone. The key/choices are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ClothingInsulationSchedule
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a straight insertion of the scheduled clothing insulation values of occupants (people).~ (The Clothing Insulation Schedule Name field should be filled.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  DynamicClothingModelASHRAE55
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be the dynamic predictive clothing insulation model developed by Schiavon and Lee (2013) based on 6,333 selected observations taken from ASHRAE RP-884 and RP-921 databases. It varies the clothing insulation as a function of outdoor air temperature measured at 6am as illustrated below.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  CalculationMethodSchedule
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used can be either the ClothingInsulationSchedule or the DynamicClothingModelASHRAE55, depending on a schedule (to be entered as the next field) that determines which method to use in different time of a day. When this option is chosen, the next field ``Clothing Insulation Calculation Method Schedule Name'' is a required input.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Field: Clothing Insulation Calculation Method Schedule Name}\label{field-clothing-insulation-calculation-method-schedule-name}

This field specifies which clothing insulation method (ClothingInsulationSchedule or DynamicClothingModelASHRAE55) to use at a particular time of the day. A schedule value of 1 means the ClothingInsulationSchedule method, and 2 means the DynamicClothingModelASHRAE55 method. This field is only required when the ``Clothing Insulation Calculation Method'' field is set to \textbf{CalculationMethodSchedule}. If this field is left blank, the specified clothing insulation calculation method will be used and not changed during the simulation.

\paragraph{Field: Clothing Insulation Schedule Name}\label{field-clothing-insulation-schedule-name}

This field is the name of the schedule that defines the amount of clothing being worn by a typical zone occupant during various times in the simulation period. The choice from the Clothing Insulation Calculation Method field should be ``\textbf{ClothingInsulationSchedule}''. This parameter must be a positive real number and has units of Clo. Typical values for Clo can be seen in the ASHRAE 2009 HOF Table 7, page 9.8 (for clothing ensembles) and Table~\ref{table:window-modeling-options}, page 9.9 (for garment values) ) or www.cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool/. This field is required to run one of the following thermal comfort models: Fanger, Pierce, or KSU. 

\paragraph{Field: Air Velocity Schedule Name}\label{field-air-velocity-schedule-name}

This field is the name of the schedule that approximates the amount of air movement in the space as a function of time throughout the simulation period. The user has control over this parameter through the schedule that requires the individual numbers in the schedule to be positive real numbers having units of meters per second. This field is required to run one of the following thermal comfort models: Fanger, Pierce, or KSU. 

\paragraph{Field: Thermal Comfort Model Type (up to 5 allowed)}\label{field-thermal-comfort-model-type-up-to-5-allowed}

The final one to five fields are optional and are intended to trigger various thermal comfort models within EnergyPlus. By entering the keywords Fanger, Pierce, KSU, AdaptiveASH55,, and AdaptiveCEN15251, the user can request the Fanger, Pierce Two-Node, Kansas State UniversityTwo-Node, and the adaptive comfort models of the ASHRAE Standard 55 and CEN Standard 15251 results for this particular people statement. AdaptiveASH55 is only applicable when the running average outdoor air temperature for the past 7 days is between 10.0 and 33.5C. AdaptiveCEN15251 is only applicable when the running average outdoor air temperature for the past 30 days is between 10.0 and 30.0C. Note that since up to five models may be specified, the user may opt to have EnergyPlus calculate the thermal comfort for people identified with this people statement using all five models if desired. Note that the KSU model is computationally intensive and may noticeably increase the execution time of the simulation. For descriptions of the thermal comfort calculations, see the Engineering Reference document.

The following IDF example allows for a maximum of 31 people with scheduled occupancy of ``Office Occupancy'', 60\% radiant using an Activity Schedule of ``Activity Sch''. The example allows for thermal comfort reporting.

\paragraph{People Occupant Count {[]}}\label{people-occupant-count}

This field is the number of people for this PEOPLE object during the timestep in question.

\paragraph{People Radiant Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{people-radiant-heating-rate-w}

\paragraph{People Radiant Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{people-radiant-heating-energy-j}

These output variables are the amount of radiant heat gain for this People object in Watts (for rate) or Joules. This is determined by the current sensible heat gain from people to the zone and the ``Fraction Radiant'' specified in the input. The radiant gains from people are distributed to the surfaces using an area weighting scheme.

\paragraph{People Convective Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{people-convective-heating-rate-w}

\paragraph{People Convective Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{people-convective-heating-energy-j}

These output variables are the amount of convective heat gain for this People object in Watts (for rate) or Joules. This is determined by the current sensible heat gain from people to the zone and the ``Fraction Radiant'' specified in input. Note that the radiant and convective gains should add up to the sensible heat gain from people. The convective heat gain from people is added to the zone air heat balance directly.

\paragraph{People Latent Gain Rate {[}W{]}}\label{people-latent-gain-rate-w}

\paragraph{People Latent Gain Energy {[}J{]}}\label{people-latent-gain-energy-j}

These output variables are the amount of latent heat gain for this People object in Watts (for rate) or Joules. This amount is based on the number of people in the space as well as the total amount of energy produced by a typical person defined by the activity schedule in the input. An internal algorithm is used to determine what fraction of the total is sensible and what fraction is latent. Details about this split are included in the Engineering Reference document.

\paragraph{People Sensible Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{people-sensible-heating-energy-j}

These output variables are the amount of sensible heat gain for this People object in Watts (for rate) or Joules. This amount is based on the number of people in the space as well as the total amount of energy produced by a typical person defined by the activity schedule in the input.

\paragraph{Zone People Sensible Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-people-sensible-heating-rate-w}

\paragraph{Zone People Sensible Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-people-sensible-heating-energy-j}

These output variables are the amount of sensible heat gain from people within the zone in Watts (for rate) or Joules. This amount is based on the number of people in the space as well as the total amount of energy produced by a typical person defined by the activity schedule in the input.

This output variable is the mean radiant temperature used in the thermal comfort calculations.~ This value is computed according to the ``MRT Calculation Type'' specified in the PEOPLE object.~ If a high temperature radiant system is present in the zone, this value will be adjusted according to the current heater operation and the ``Fraction of radiant energy incident on people'' specified in the HIGH TEMP RADIANT SYSTEM object.

This output variable is the operative temperature as defined by the thermal comfort operations. Specifically, it is the average of the thermal comfort mean radiant temperature and the zone air temperature.

Note for all Thermal Comfort reporting:~ Though the published values for thermal comfort ``vote'' have a discrete scale (e.g. --3 to +3 or --4 to +4), the calculations in EnergyPlus are carried out on a continuous scale and, thus, reporting may be ``off the scale'' with specific conditions encountered in the space. This is not necessarily an error in EnergyPlus -- rather a different approach that does not take the ``limits'' of the discrete scale values into account.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-1-014}

The following output variables are all based on whether the humidity ratio and the operative temperature is within the region shown in ASHRAE Standard 55-2004 in Figure 5.2.1.1. For these outputs the operative temperature is simplified to be the average of the air temperature and the mean radiant temperature. For summer, the 0.5 Clo level is used and, for winter, the 1.0 Clo level is used. The graphs below are based on the following tables which extend the ASHRAE values to zero humidity ratio.

\subsection{Simplified ASHRAE 55 Warnings}\label{simplified-ashrae-55-warnings}

The simplified ASHRAE 55 calculations may be computed for occupied zones and, possibly, warnings are shown on the .err file at the end of each simulated environment. To enable this option set the ``Enable ASHRAE 55 comfort warnings'' field of the People object to Yes. These warnings will not be generated by default.

If you enable the warnings, the simplified ASHRAE 55 calculations are done for occupied zones and, possibly, warnings are shown on the .err file at the end of each simulated environment.

\begin{lstlisting}
** Warning ** More than 4% of time (350.4 hours) uncomfortable in zone ZSF1
** ~~~ ** 553.0 hours were uncomfortable based on ASHRAE 55-2004 graph (Section 5.2.1.1)
** ~~~ ** During Environment [10/01 - 09/30]: CHICAGO IL USA TMY2-94846 WMO\# = 725300
** Warning ** More than 4% of time (350.4 hours) uncomfortable in zone ZNF1
** ~~~ ** 827.8 hours were uncomfortable based on ASHRAE 55-2004 graph (Section 5.2.1.1)

** Warning ** More than 4% of time (350.4 hours) uncomfortable in zone ZSF2
** ~~~ ** 593.5 hours were uncomfortable based on ASHRAE 55-2004 graph (Section 5.2.1.1)
** ~~~ ** During Environment [10/01 - 09/30]: CHICAGO IL USA TMY2-94846 WMO\# = 725300
** Warning ** More than 4% of time (350.4 hours) uncomfortable in zone ZNF2
** ~~~ ** 875.8 hours were uncomfortable based on ASHRAE 55-2004 graph (Section 5.2.1.1)
** ~~~ ** During Environment [10/01 - 09/30]: CHICAGO IL USA TMY2-94846 WMO\# = 725300
\end{lstlisting}

You may decide if you need to change parameters to reduce these ``uncomfortable'' hours. The individual output variables shown previously may help you get more details on when these are occurring.

Following are some suggestions that might be applicable:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Eliminate occupancy when conditioning equipment is off.
\item
  Note that the ASHRAE graph lower limit is (19.6C to 21.7C) -- heating setpoints may need to be nearer 22.2C (72F) than 21.1C (70F).
\item
  Unoccupied heating setpoint should be nearer 16.7C (62F) rather than 12.8C (55F) to reduce the start up recovery.
\item
  Start the occupied setpoint schedule, fan availability schedule, cooling pump availability schedule, reheat coil availability, one hour before occupancy. Seasonal turn on and off of equipment may cause more warnings (but potentially more energy consumption).
\item
  Unoccupied cooling setpoint should be nearer 29.4C (85F) rather than 40.0 (104F) to reduce the start up recovery.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ComfortViewFactorAngles}\label{comfortviewfactorangles}

When requesting EnergyPlus to do a thermal comfort calculation, the program user has three options for defining how the mean radiant temperature will be calculated. The user may select ``zoneaveraged'' which results in a mean radiant temperature that is characteristic of an ``average'' location near the center of the zone. The user may also elect to place the person near a particular surface by selecting ``surfaceweighted'' in the People statement. This takes the average of the zone mean radiant temperature and the temperature of the surface that the person is near and uses this value as the mean radiant temperature when calculating thermal comfort.

The third option is for the user to more explicitly position the person within the space by defining the angle factors from the person to the various surfaces in the zone. This option requires the user to list the surfaces that the person can see from a radiation standpoint and also define the angle (or view) factor for each surface. The AngleFactorList input line is intended to give the user this opportunity.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-023}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-022}

This field is an unique user assigned name for the list of surfaces that can be seen radiantly by the person for whom thermal comfort is to be evaluated. Any reference to this list by a People statement will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-007}

Zone Name for this surface list. Each of the surfaces listed must be in this zone.

\paragraph{Field: Surface \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-surface-name-002}

This field is the name of a surface in the zone seen by the person.

\paragraph{Field: Angle Factor \textless{}\#\textgreater{}}\label{field-angle-factor}

This field is the fraction that this surface contributes to the total mean radiant temperature. This can be thought of as a weighting factor for this surface and the actual mean radiant temperature used in the thermal comfort model is simply the sum of all angle factors multiplied by the corresponding inside surface temperature. Note that the Surface Name/Angle Factor pair can be repeated up to 20 times. The sum of all angle factors within any angle factor list must equal unity, otherwise the program will not accept the input as valid.

An example IDF with an electric low temperature radiant system is shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}
ComfortViewFactorAngles,
  South Zone Angle Factors, !- name of angle factor list
  South Zone,           !- Zone Name
  Zn001:Flr001,         !- Surface name 1
  0.75,                 !- Angle factor for surface 1
  Zn001:Wall001,        !- Surface name 2
  0.15,                 !- Angle factor for surface 2
  Zn001:Roof001,        !- Surface name 3
  0.10;                 !- Angle factor for surface 3
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Lights}\label{lights-000}

The Lights statement allows you to specify information about a zone's electric lighting system, including design power level and operation schedule, and how the heat from lights is distributed thermally.

A zone may have multiple Lights statements. For example, one statement may describe the general lighting in the zone and another the task lighting. Or you can use multiple Lights statements for a zone that has two or more general lighting systems that differ in design level, schedule, etc.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-021}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-2-020}

The name of the Lights object.

\paragraph{Field: Zone or ZoneList Name}\label{field-zone-or-zonelist-name-1-000}

The field is the name of the thermal zone (ref: Zone) or ZoneList (ref: ZoneLIst) and links this Lights statement to a thermal zone or set of thermal zones in the buidling. When the ZoneList option is used then this lights definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for the amount of light wattage in the zone. The Zonelist option can be used effectively with the watts/area and watts/person options of the Design Level Calculation Method.

The name of the actual lights object becomes \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{} \textless{}Lights Object Name\textgreater{} and should be less than the standard length (100 characters) for a name field. If it is greater than this standard length, it may be difficult to specify in output reporting as it will be truncated. A warning will be shown if the generated name is greater than 100 characters. If it duplicates another such concatenated name, there will be a severe error and terminate the run.

\paragraph{Field: Schedule Name}\label{field-schedule-name-002}

The name of the schedule that modifies the lighting power design level (see Design Level Calculation Method field and related subsequent fields). The schedule values can be any positive number. The electrical input for lighting in a particular timestep is the product of the design level and the value of this schedule in that timestep. If the design level is the maximum lighting power input the schedule should contain values between 0.0 and 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Design Level Calculation Method}\label{field-design-level-calculation-method}

This field is a key/choice field that tells which of the next three fields are filled and is descriptive of the method for calculating the nominal lighting level in the Zone. The key/choices are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  LightingLevel
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a straight insertion of the lighting level (Watts) for the Zone.~ (The Lighting Level field should be filled.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Watts/Area
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor per floor area of the zone. (The Watts per Zone Floor Area field should be filled).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Watts/Person
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor of lighting level (watts) per person. (The Watts per person field should be filled).

\paragraph{Field: Lighting Level}\label{field-lighting-level}

This is typically the maximum electrical power input (in Watts) to lighting in a zone, including ballasts, if present. This value is multiplied by a schedule fraction (see previous field) to get the lighting power in a particular timestep. In EnergyPlus, this is slightly more flexible in that the lighting design level could be a ``diversity factor'' applied to a schedule of real numbers.

\paragraph{Field: Watts per Zone Floor Area}\label{field-watts-per-zone-floor-area}

This factor (watts/m\(^{2}\)) is used, along with the Zone Floor Area to determine the maximum lighting level as described in the Lighting Level field. The choice from the method field should be ``watts/area''.

\paragraph{Field: Watts per Person}\label{field-watts-per-person}

This factor (watts/person) is used, along with the number of occupants (people) to determine the maximum lighting level as described in the Lighting Level field. The choice from the method field should be ``watts/person''.

\paragraph{Heat Gains from Lights:}\label{heat-gains-from-lights}

The electrical input to lighting ultimately appears as heat that contributes to zone loads or to return air heat gains. In EnergyPlus this heat is divided into four different fractions. Three of these are given by the input fields Return Air Fraction, Fraction Radiant and Fraction Visible. A fourth, defined as the fraction of the heat from lights convected to the zone air, is calculated by the program as:

f\(_{convected}\) = 1.0 -- (Return Air Fraction + Fraction Radiant + Fraction Visible)

You will get an error message if Return Air Fraction + Fraction Radiant + Fraction Visible exceeds 1.0.

These fractions depend on the type of lamp and luminaire, whether the luminaire is vented to the return air, etc.

\paragraph{Field: Return Air Fraction}\label{field-return-air-fraction}

The fraction of the heat from lights that goes into the zone return air (i.e., into the zone outlet node). If the return air flow is zero or the zone has no return air system, the program will put this fraction into the zone air. Return Air Fraction should be non-zero only for luminaires that are return-air ducted~ (see Table~\ref{table:approximate-values-of-return-air-fraction} and Figure 51). (However, see the field ``Return Air Fraction Is Calculated from Plenum Temperature,'' below, for an approach to modeling the case where Return Air Fraction is caused by \emph{conduction} between a luminaire that is in contact with a return-air plenum.)

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Radiant}\label{field-fraction-radiant-1}

The fraction of heat from lights that goes into the zone as long-wave (thermal) radiation. The program calculates how much of this radiation is absorbed by the inside surfaces of the zone according the area times thermal absorptance product of these surfaces.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Visible}\label{field-fraction-visible}

The fraction of heat from lights that goes into the zone as visible (short-wave) radiation. The program calculates how much of this radiation is absorbed by the inside surfaces of the zone according the area times solar absorptance product of these surfaces.

Approximate values of Return Air Fraction, Fraction Radiant and Fraction Visible are given in Table~\ref{table:approximate-values-of-return-air-fraction} for overhead fluorescent lighting for a variety of luminaire configurations. The data is based on ASHRAE 1282-RP ``Lighting Heat Gain Distribution in Buildings'' by Daniel E. Fisher and Chanvit Chantrasrisalai.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Replaceable}\label{field-fraction-replaceable}

This field defines the daylighting control for the LIGHTS object.

If \textbf{Daylighting:Controls} is specified for the zone, this field is used as an on/off flag for dimming controls. If set to 0.0, the lights are not dimmed by the daylighting controls. If set to 1.0, the lights are allowed to be dimmed by the daylighting controls.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-002}

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Task Lights'', ``Hall Lights'', etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory~ (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table. If this field is omitted or blank, the lights will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory. Any text may be used here to categorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and the LEED EAp2-4/5. Performance Rating Method Compliance table.

\paragraph{Field: Return Air Fraction Calculated from Plenum Temperature}\label{field-return-air-fraction-calculated-from-plenum-temperature}

Accepts values Yes or No (the default). Yes is for advanced used only. In this case the program will calculate the return air fraction by assuming that it is due to conduction of some of the light heat into the zone's return air plenum and that the amount of the conduction depends on the plenum air temperature. A Yes value should only be used for luminaires that are recessed and non-vented, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vertical-section-through-a-zone-and-its}.

The value you enter for the Return Air Fraction field will be ignored and you can enter, for fluorescent lighting, Fraction Radiant = 0.37 and Fraction Visible = 0.18, as indicated in Table~\ref{table:approximate-values-of-return-air-fraction}.

This feature requires that the coefficients described below be determined from measurements or detailed calculations since they are very sensitive to the luminaire type, lamp type, thermal resistance between fixture and plenum, etc.

If ``Return Air Fraction Is Calculated from Plenum Temperature'' = Yes, the return air fraction is calculated \emph{each timestep} from the following empirical correlation:

\begin{equation}
  (\rm{Return Air Fraction})_{\rm{calculated}} = C_{1} - C_{2} \times T_{\rm{plenum}}
\end{equation}

where T\(_{\rm{plenum}}\) is the previous-time-step value of the return plenum air temperature (C),

and C\(_{1}\) and C\(_{2}\) are the values of the coefficients entered in the next two fields.

To compensate for the change in the return air fraction relative to its input value, the program modifies Fraction Radiant and \(f_{\rm{convected}}\) by a scale factor such that

\begin{equation}
  (\rm{Return Air Fraction})_{\rm{calculated}} + (\rm{Fraction Radiant})_{\rm{modified}} + (f_{\rm{convected}})_{\rm{modified}} + (\rm{Fraction Visible})_{\rm{input}} = 1.0
\end{equation}

It is assumed that Fraction Visible is a constant equal to its input value.

\paragraph{Field: Return Air Fraction Function of Plenum Temperature Coefficient 1}\label{field-return-air-fraction-function-of-plenum-temperature-coefficient-1}

The coefficient C\(_{1}\) in the equation for (Return Air Fraction)\(_{calculated}\).

\paragraph{Field: Return Air Fraction Function of Plenum Temperature Coefficient 2}\label{field-return-air-fraction-function-of-plenum-temperature-coefficient-2}

The coefficient C\(_{2}\) in the equation for (Return Air Fraction)\(_{calculated}\). Its units are 1/\(^{O}\)C.

\paragraph{Field: Return Air Heat Gain Node Name}\label{field-return-air-heat-gain-node-name}

Name of the return air node for this heat gain. If left blank, it defaults to the first return air node for the zone containing this Lights object. Leave blank when using a ZoneList name.

\subsection{ElectricEquipment}\label{electricequipment}

The object models equipment in the zone which consumes electricity, such as computers, televisions, and cooking equipment, also known as ``plug loads.'' All of the energy consumed by the equipment becomes a heat gain in the zone or is lost (exhausted) as specified below.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-3-019}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-3-017}

The name of the ElectricEquipment object.

\paragraph{Field: Zone or ZoneList Name}\label{field-zone-or-zonelist-name-2}

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) or ZoneList (ref: ZoneList) and attaches a particular electric equipment statement to a thermal zone or set of thermal zones in the building. When the ZoneList option is used then this electric equipment definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for the amount of electric wattage in the zone. The Zonelist option can be used effectively with the watts/area and watts/person options of the Design Level Calculation Method.

The name of the actual electric equipment object becomes \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{} \textless{}ElectricEquipment Object Name\textgreater{} and should be less than the standard length (100 characters) for a name field. If it is greater than this standard length, it may be difficult to specify in output reporting as it will be truncated. A warning will be shown if the generated name is greater than 100 characters. If it duplicates another such concatenated name, there will be a severe error and terminate the run.

\paragraph{Field: Schedule Name}\label{field-schedule-name-1-001}

This field is the name of the schedule that modifies the design level parameter for electric equipment (see Design Level Calculation Method field and related subsequent fields). The schedule values can be any positive number. The actual electrical input for equipment in a zone as defined by this statement is the product of the design level field and the value of the schedule specified by name in this field.

\paragraph{Field: Design Level Calculation Method}\label{field-design-level-calculation-method-1}

This field is a key/choice field that tells which of the next three fields are filled and is descriptive of the method for calculating the nominal electric equipment level in the Zone. The key/choices are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  EquipmentLevel
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a straight insertion of the electric equipment level (Watts) for the Zone.~ (The Design Level field should be filled.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Watts/Area
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor per floor area of the zone. (The Watts per Zone Floor Area field should be filled).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Watts/Person
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor of equipment level (watts) per person. (The Watts per Person field should be filled).

\paragraph{Field: Design Level}\label{field-design-level-000}

This field (in Watts) is typically used to represent the maximum electrical input to equipment in a zone that is then multiplied by a schedule fraction (see previous field). In EnergyPlus, this is slightly more flexible in that the electric equipment design level could be a ``diversity factor'' applied to a schedule of real numbers. Note that while the schedule value can vary from hour to hour, the design level field is constant for all simulation environments.

\paragraph{Field: Watts per Zone Floor Area}\label{field-watts-per-zone-floor-area-1}

This factor (watts/m\(^{2}\)) is used, along with the Zone Area to determine the maximum equipment level as described in the Design Level field. The choice from the method field should be ``Watts/Area''.

\paragraph{Field: Watts per Person}\label{field-watts-per-person-1}

This factor (watts/person) is used, along with the number of occupants (people) to determine the maximum equipment level as described in the Design Level field. The choice from the method field should be ``Watts/Person''.

\paragraph{Heat Gains from Electric Equipment:}\label{heat-gains-from-electric-equipment}

The electrical input to the equipment ultimately appears as heat that contributes to zone loads. In EnergyPlus this heat is divided into four different fractions. Three of these are given by the input fields Fraction Latent, Fraction Radiant and Fraction Lost. A fourth, defined as the fraction of the heat from electric equipment convected to the zone air, is calculated by the program as:

\begin{equation}
  f_{\rm{convected}} = 1.0 - (\rm{Fraction Latent} + \rm{Fraction Radiant} + \rm{Fraction Lost})
\end{equation}

You will get an error message if Fraction Latent + Fraction Radiant + Fraction Lost exceeds 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Latent}\label{field-fraction-latent}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of latent heat given off by electric equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by electric equipment to give the amount of latent energy produced by the electric equipment. This energy affects the moisture balance within the zone.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Radiant}\label{field-fraction-radiant-2}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of long-wave radiant heat being given off by electric equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by electric equipment to give the amount of long wavelength radiation gain from electric equipment in a zone.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Lost}\label{field-fraction-lost}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of ``lost'' heat being given off by electric equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by electric equipment to give the amount of heat which is ``lost'' and does not impact the zone energy balances. This might correspond to electrical energy converted to mechanical work or heat that is vented to the atmosphere.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-1-001}

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Computers'', ``Copy Machines'', etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory~ (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table. If this field is omitted or blank, the equipment will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory. Any text may be used here to categorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and the LEED Summary table EAp2-4/5. Performance Rating Method Compliance.

When the ZoneList option is used then this gas equipment definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for the amount of gas in the zone. The Zonelist option can be used effectively with the watts/area and watts/person options of the Design Level Calculation Method.

The name of the actual gas equipment object becomes \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{} \textless{}GasEquipment Object Name\textgreater{} and should be less than the standard length (100 characters) for a name field. If it is greater than this standard length, it may be difficult to specify in output reporting as it will be truncated. A warning will be shown if the generated name is greater than 100 characters.

This field is a key/choice field that tells which of the next three fields are filled and is descriptive of the method for calculating the nominal gas equipment level in the Zone. The key/choices are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  EquipmentLevel
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a straight insertion of the gas equipment level (Watts) for the Zone.~ (The Design Level field should be filled.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Watts/Area or Power/Area
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor per floor area of the zone. (The Power per Zone Floor Area field should be filled).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Watts/Person or Power/Person
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor of equipment level (watts) per person. (The Power per Person field should be filled).

\paragraph{Field: Design Level}\label{field-design-level-1-000}

This field (in Watts) is typically used to represent the maximum energy input to gas equipment in a zone that is then multiplied by a schedule fraction (see previous field). In EnergyPlus, this is slightly more flexible in that the gas equipment design level could be a ``diversity factor'' applied to a schedule of real numbers. Note that while the schedule value can vary from hour to hour, the design level field is constant for all simulation environments.

\paragraph{Field: Power per Zone Floor Area}\label{field-power-per-zone-floor-area}

This factor (watts/m\(^{2}\)) is used, along with the Zone Area to determine the maximum equipment level as described in the Design Level field. The choice from the method field should be ``\textbf{Watts/Area}'' or ``\textbf{Power/Area}''.

\paragraph{Field: Power per Person}\label{field-power-per-person}

This factor (watts/person) is used, along with the number of occupants (people) to determine the maximum equipment level as described in the Design Level field. The choice from the method field should be ``\textbf{Watts/Person}'' or ``\textbf{Power/Person}''.

\paragraph{Heat Gains from Gas Equipment:}\label{heat-gains-from-gas-equipment}

The fuel input to the equipment ultimately appears as heat that contributes to zone loads. In EnergyPlus this heat is divided into four different fractions. Three of these are given by the input fields Fraction Latent, Fraction Radiant and Fraction Lost. A fourth, defined as the fraction of the heat from gas equipment convected to the zone air, is calculated by the program as:

\begin{equation}
  f_{convected} = 1.0 - (\rm{Fraction Latent} + \rm{Fraction Radiant} + \rm{Fraction Lost})
\end{equation}

You will get an error message if Fraction Latent + Fraction Radiant + Fraction Lost exceeds 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Latent}\label{field-fraction-latent-1}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of latent heat given off by gas equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by gas equipment to give the amount of latent energy produced by the gas equipment. This energy affects the moisture balance within the zone.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Radiant}\label{field-fraction-radiant-3}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of long-wave radiant heat being given off by gas equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by gas equipment to give the amount of long wavelength radiation gain from gas equipment in a zone.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Lost}\label{field-fraction-lost-1}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of ``lost'' heat being given off by gas equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by gas equipment to give the amount of heat which is ``lost'' and does not impact the zone energy balances. This might correspond to input energy converted to mechanical work or heat that is vented to the atmosphere.

\paragraph{Field: Carbon Dioxide Generation Rate}\label{field-carbon-dioxide-generation-rate-1}

This numeric input field specifies carbon dioxide generation rate with units of m3/s-W. The default value of 0.0 assumes the equipment is fully vented to outdoors. In the absence of better information, the user might consider using a value of 3.45E-8 m3/s-W which assumes the equipment is not vented to outdoors. This value is converted from natural gas CO\(_{2}\) emission rate at 11.7 lbs CO\(_{2}\) per therm. The CO\(_{2}\) emission rate is provided by U.S. Energy Information Administration, ``Frequently Asked Questions - Environment, Questions About Environmental Emissions'', \url{http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/ask/environment_faqs.asp#CO2_quantity}, January 2010. The maximum value for this input field is 3.45E-7 m3/s-W.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-2-001}

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Cooking'', ``Clothes Drying'', etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory~ (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table. If this field is omitted or blank, the equipment will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory. Any text may be used here to categorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and the LEED Summary table EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance.

The Zonelist option can be used effectively with the watts/area and watts/person options of the Design Level Calculation Method.

The name of the actual hot water equipment object becomes \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{} \textless{}HotWaterEquipment Object Name\textgreater{} and should be less than the standard length (100 characters) for a name field. If it is greater than this standard length, it may be difficult to specify in output reporting as it will be truncated. A warning will be shown if the generated name is greater than 100 characters.

\subsection{SwimmingPool:Indoor}\label{swimmingpoolindoor}

The Indoor Swimming Pool object is used to describe the indoor swimming pools that are exposed to the internal environment. There are several rules that should be noted regarding the specification of an indoor pool in EnergyPlus. First, the pool is linked to a surface that must be a floor. The pool is assumed to cover the entire floor to which it is linked. If the pool only covers part of the floor in the actual building, then the user must break the floor up into multiple sections.

As pools attempt to achieve a particular water temperature and have a variety of heat losses, heating equipment is necessary to maintain the proper setpoint temperature. In EnergyPlus, the pool itself becomes part of the demand side of a plant loop with heating equipment on the supply side providing whatever heating is needed to maintain the desired temperature. This heating equipment as well as the loop connections must be entered separately and the input shown in this section only details what is needed to specify the pool itself.

The following information is useful for defining and modeling an indoor pool in EnergyPlus. For more information on the algorithm used for this model or details on some of the input parameters, please reference the indoor pool section of the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference document.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-7-012}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-7-008}

This is a unique name associated with the indoor swimming pool.

\paragraph{Field: Surface Name}\label{field-surface-name-1-000}

This is the name of the surface (floor) where the pool is located. Pools are not allowed on any surfaces other than a floor.

\paragraph{Field: Average Depth}\label{field-average-depth}

This field is the average depth of the pool in meters. If the pool has variable depth, the average depth should be specified to achieve the proper volume of water in the pool.

\paragraph{Field: Activity Factor Schedule Name}\label{field-activity-factor-schedule-name}

This field references a schedule that contains values for pool activity. This parameter can be varied using the schedule named here, and it has an impact on the amount of evaporation that will take place from the pool to the surrounding zone air. For example values of the activity factor and what impact it will have on the evaporation of water from the pool, please refer to the Indoor Swimming Pool section of the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference document. If left blank, the activity factor will be assumed to be unity. Note that the activity factor should not be set equal to an occupancy schedule since an activity factor of zero means that no evaporation will take place from the pool.

\paragraph{Field: Make-up Water Supply Schedule Name}\label{field-make-up-water-supply-schedule-name}

The scheduled named by this field establishes a cold water temperature {[}C{]} for the water that replaces the water which is lost from the pool due to evaporation. If blank, water temperatures are calculated by the Site:WaterMainsTemperature object. This field (even if blank) overrides the Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule in all of the listed WaterUse:Equipment objects.

\paragraph{Field: Cover Schedule Name}\label{field-cover-schedule-name}

This schedule defines when the pool water cover is available and affects the evaporation, convection, and radiation rate calculations. A schedule value of 0.0 means that the pool is not covered. A schedule value of 1.0 means the pool is 100\% covered. The pool may be fully covered, fully open (uncovered), or partially covered (a value between 0.0 and 1.0). The user also has the option to control the evaporation, convection, short-wavelength radiation, and long-wavelength radiation factors when the pool is covered. These terms are discussed in the next four fields.

\paragraph{Field: Cover Evaporation Factor}\label{field-cover-evaporation-factor}

This input field can optionally be used to modify the pool evaporation rate and is used in conjunction with the pool cover factor defined by the Pool Cover Schedule field (see above). The value for this parameter can normally range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1 means that the pool cover completely eliminates evaporation from the pool surface, 0 means the pool cover has no effect on evaporation, and fractions in between 0 and 1 result in a fractional reduction in evaporation by the pool cover. So, if this parameter is 0.5 and the pool is 50\% covered, the overall reduction in evaporation from a fully uncovered pool is 25\% or 0.25.

\paragraph{Field: Cover Convection Factor}\label{field-cover-convection-factor}

This input field can optionally be used to modify the pool convection rate and is used in conjunction with the pool cover factor defined by the Pool Cover Schedule field (see above). The value for this parameter can normally range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1 means that the pool cover completely eliminates convection from the pool surface, 0 means the pool cover has no effect on convection, and fractions in between 0 and 1 result in a fractional reduction in convection by the pool cover. So, if this parameter is 0.5 and the pool is 50\% covered, the overall reduction in convection from a fully uncovered pool is 25\% or 0.25.

\paragraph{Field: Cover Short-Wavelength Radiation Factor}\label{field-cover-short-wavelength-radiation-factor}

This input field can optionally be used to modify the pool short-wavelength radiation rate and is used in conjunction with the pool cover factor defined by the Pool Cover Schedule field (see above). The value for this parameter can normally range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1 means that the pool cover completely eliminates short-wavelength radiation from the pool surface, 0 means the pool cover has no effect on short-wavelength radiation, and fractions in between 0 and 1 result in a fractional reduction in short-wavelength radiation by the pool cover. So, if this parameter is 0.5 and the pool is 50\% covered, the overall reduction in short-wavelength radiation from a fully uncovered pool is 25\% or 0.25. Note that with radiation terms that whatever portion of the short-wavelength radiation is blocked by the cover is transferred via convection to the surrounding zone air.

\paragraph{Field: Cover Long-Wavelength Radiation Factor}\label{field-cover-long-wavelength-radiation-factor}

This input field can optionally be used to modify the pool long-wavelength radiation rate and is used in conjunction with the pool cover factor defined by the Pool Cover Schedule field (see above). The value for this parameter can normally range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1 means that the pool cover completely eliminates long-wavelength radiation from the pool surface, 0 means the pool cover has no effect on long-wavelength radiation, and fractions in between 0 and 1 result in a fractional reduction in long-wavelength radiation by the pool cover. So, if this parameter is 0.5 and the pool is 50\% covered, the overall reduction in long-wavelength radiation from a fully uncovered pool is 25\% or 0.25. Note that with radiation terms that whatever portion of the long-wavelength radiation is blocked by the cover is transferred via convection to the surrounding zone air.

\paragraph{Field: Pool Water Inlet Node}\label{field-pool-water-inlet-node}

This input is the name of the node on the demand side of a plant loop that leads into the pool. From the standpoint of an EnergyPlus input file, the pool sits on a plant demand loop, and the pump and heater reside on the plant supply loop. The pool heater and pump must be defined by other existing EnergyPlus input.

\paragraph{Field: Pool Water Outlet Node}\label{field-pool-water-outlet-node}

This input is the name of the node on the demand side of a plant loop that leads out of the pool. From the standpoint of an EnergyPlus input file, the pool sits on a plant demand loop, and the pump and heater reside on the plant supply loop. The pool heater and pump must be defined by other existing EnergyPlus input.

\paragraph{Field: Pool Water Maximum Flow Rate}\label{field-pool-water-maximum-flow-rate}

This input is the maximum water volumetric flow rate in m3/s going between the pool and the water heating equipment. This along with the pool setpoint temperature and the heating plant equipment outlet temperature will establish the maximum heat addition to the pool. This flow rate to the pool will be varied in an attempt to reach the desired pool water setpoint temperature (see Setpoint Temperature Schedule below).

\paragraph{Field: Pool Miscellaneous Equipment Power}\label{field-pool-miscellaneous-equipment-power}

This input defines the power consumption rate of miscellaneous equipment such as the filtering and chlorination technology associated with the pool. The units for this input are in power consumption per flow rate of water through the pool from the heater or W/(m3/s). This field will be multiplied by the flow rate of water through the pool to determine the power consumption of this equipment. Any heat generated by this equipment is assumed to have no effect on the pool water itself.

\paragraph{Field: Setpoint Temperature Schedule}\label{field-setpoint-temperature-schedule}

Pools attempt to maintain a particular water temperature. In EnergyPlus, this field defines the setpoint temperature for the desired pool water temperature. It is input as a schedule to allow the user to vary the pool setpoint temperature as desired. The equipment defined to provide heating for the pool will deliver the necessary hot water to the pool, up to the capacity of that equipment defined by other input by the user.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Number of People}\label{field-maximum-number-of-people}

This field defines the maximum occupancy of people actually in the pool and thus will be used with the next two inputs to determine how much heat people contribute to the pool heat balance. People who are not in the pool should be modeled separately using the standard People description for zones.

\paragraph{Field: People Schedule}\label{field-people-schedule}

This field defines a schedule that establishes how many people are in the pool at any given time. The current value of this schedule is multiplied by the maximum number of people in the previous field determines how many people are currently in the pool.

\paragraph{Field: People Heat Gain Schedule}\label{field-people-heat-gain-schedule}

This field defines the amount of heat given off by an average person in the pool in Watts. This field is a schedule so that this heat gain can be allowed to vary as the type of activity in a pool can vary greatly and thus the amount of heat gain per person also varies. This parameter times the number of people in the pool determines how much heat is added to the pool. All heat given off by people is added to the heat balance of the pool water.

An example of an indoor swimming pool definition is:

\subsection{OtherEquipment}\label{otherequipment}

Other Equipment object is provided as an additional source for heat gains or losses directly to the zone with a fuel type that is configurable. If a fuel type is specified, the energy is attributed to the appropriate end use. Otherwise, a loss can be entered by putting a negative value into the Design Level field and this object will not have an end-use component -- gains or losses do not show up in the bottom energy lines (except as influencing overall zone gains or losses).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-8-010}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-8-008}

The name of the OtherEquipment object.

\paragraph{Field: Fuel Type}\label{field-fuel-use-type}

This field designates the appropriate meter for the equipment. Valid fuel types are: None, Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, Diesel, Gasoline, Coal, Steam, DistrictHeating, DistrictCooling, OtherFuel1 and OtherFuel2. The fuel type triggers the application of consumption amounts to the appropriate energy meters. If the None fuel type is selected (the default if left blank), no end uses will be associated with the object, only the zone gains. 

\paragraph{Field: Zone or ZoneList Name}\label{field-zone-or-zonelist-name-6}

This field is the name of the thermal zone (ref: Zone) and attaches a particular other equipment statement to a thermal zone or set of thermal zones in the building. When the ZoneList option is used then this other equipment definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for the amount of other in the zone. This option can be used effectively with the watts/area and watts/person options of the Design Level Calculation Method.

\paragraph{Field: Schedule Name}\label{field-schedule-name-5-000}

This field is the name of the schedule that modifies the design level parameter for other equipment (see Design Level Calculation Method field and related subsequent fields). The schedule values can be any positive number. The actual energy input for other equipment in a zone as defined by this statement is the product of the design level field and the value of the schedule specified by name in this field.

\paragraph{Field: Design Level Calculation Method}\label{field-design-level-calculation-method-5}

This field is a key/choice field that tells which of the next three fields are filled and is descriptive of the method for calculating the nominal other equipment level in the Zone. The key/choices are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  EquipmentLevel
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a straight insertion of the other equipment level (Watts) for the Zone.~ (The Design Level field should be filled.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Watts/Area or Power/Area
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor per floor area of the zone. (The Power per Zone Floor Area field should be filled).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Watts/Person or Power/Person
\end{itemize}

With this choice, the method used will be a factor of equipment level (watts) per person. (The Power per Person field should be filled).

\paragraph{Field: Design Level}\label{field-design-level-4}

This field (in Watts) is typically used to represent the maximum energy input to other equipment in a zone that is then multiplied by a schedule fraction (see previous field). In EnergyPlus, this is slightly more flexible in that the other equipment design level could be a ``diversity factor'' applied to a schedule of real numbers. This value can be negative to denote a loss if the None fuel type is selected, otherwise this must be positive. Note that while the schedule value can vary from hour to hour, the design level field is constant for all simulation environments.

\paragraph{Field: Power per Zone Floor Area}\label{field-power-per-zone-floor-area-3}

This factor (watts/m\(^{2}\)) is used, along with the Zone Area to determine the maximum equipment level as described in the Design Level field. This value can be negative to denote a loss if the None fuel type is selected, otherwise this must be positive. The choice from the method field should be ``\textbf{Watts/Area}'' or ``\textbf{Power/Area}''.

\paragraph{Field: Power per Person}\label{field-power-per-person-3}

This factor (watts/person) is used, along with the number of occupants (people) to determine the maximum equipment level as described in the Design Level field. This value can be negative to denote a loss if the None fuel type is selected, otherwise this must be positive. The choice from the method field should be ``\textbf{Watts/Person}'' or ``\textbf{Power/Person}''.

\paragraph{Heat Gains/Losses from Other Equipment:}\label{heat-gainslosses-from-other-equipment}

The fuel input to the equipment ultimately appears as heat that contributes to zone loads. In EnergyPlus this heat is divided into four different fractions. Three of these are given by the input fields Fraction Latent, Fraction Radiant and Fraction Lost. A fourth, defined as the fraction of the heat from other equipment convected to the zone air, is calculated by the program as:

\begin{equation}
  f_{\rm{convected}} = 1.0 - (\rm{Fraction Latent} + \rm{Fraction Radiant} + \rm{Fraction Lost})
\end{equation}

You will get an error message if \(\rm{Fraction Latent} + \rm{Fraction Radiant} + \rm{Fraction Lost}\) exceeds 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Latent}\label{field-fraction-latent-4}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of latent heat given off by other equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by other equipment to give the amount of latent energy produced by the other equipment. This energy affects the moisture balance within the zone.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Radiant}\label{field-fraction-radiant-6}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of long-wave radiant heat being given off by other equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by other equipment to give the amount of long wavelength radiation gain from other equipment in a zone.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction Lost}\label{field-fraction-lost-4}

This field is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and is used to characterize the amount of ``lost'' heat being given off by other equipment in a zone. The number specified in this field will be multiplied by the total energy consumed by other equipment to give the amount of heat which is ``lost'' and does not impact the zone energy balances. This might correspond to input energy converted to mechanical work or heat that is vented to the atmosphere.

\paragraph{Field: Carbon Dioxide Generation Rate}\label{field-carbon-dioxide-generation-rate-otherequip}

This numeric input field specifies carbon dioxide generation rate with units of m3/s-W. The default value of 0.0 assumes the equipment is fully vented to outdoors. The maximum value for this input field is 3.45E-7 m3/s-W.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-otherequip}

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Cooking'', ``Clothes Drying'', etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory~ (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table. If this field is omitted or blank, the equipment will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory. Any text may be used here to categorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary table EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance.

\paragraph{Field: Initial Emission Rate}\label{field-initial-emission-rate}

This field denotes the initial generic contaminant design emission rate (m\(^{3}\)/s). The generation is controlled by a schedule, as defined in the next field. Generic contaminant emission begins when the schedule changes from a zero to a non-zero value (between zero and one). The initial emission rate is equal to the schedule value times the initial generation rate. A single schedule may be used to initiate several emissions at different times.(see Field:Generation Schedule Name).

\paragraph{Field: Schedule Name}\label{field-schedule-name-7}

This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that modifies the maximum design emission rate (G\(_{f}\)). This fraction between 0.0 and 1.0 is noted as F\(_{G}\) in the above equation. When the value is equal to 1, the generation rate is used and time is reset to zero. When the value is equal to zero, the schedule value is ignored in the equation.

\paragraph{Field: Decay Time Constant}\label{field-decay-time-constant}

This field is the time at which the generation rate reaches 0.37 of the original rate.

\subsection{ZoneBaseboard:OutdoorTemperatureControlled}\label{zonebaseboardoutdoortemperaturecontrolled}

This object specifies outside temperature-controlled (OTC) baseboard heating. The capacities (high and low) are specified in W at the temperatures specified. The schedule allows both capacities to change hourly on a proportional basis. This baseboard heater does not operate if the outdoor dry-bulb is above the high temperature limit. Between the high temperature and the low temperature, the capacity is interpolated (linear) between the high and the low capacity values. Below the low temperature, the capacity is set at the low capacity value. This allows the user to add baseboard heat to a perimeter zone starting at a prescribed temperature and then slowly increases this capacity to a max value.
