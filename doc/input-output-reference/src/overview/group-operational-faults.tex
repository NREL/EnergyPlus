\subsection{Introduction to Operational Faults Modeling}\label{introduction-to-operational-faults-modeling}

Most of the buildings, either new or old, have operational faults in the sensors, controllers, meters, equipment and systems. Being able to model and simulate these faults and their impact on energy performance of buildings is crucial to improve accuracy of building simulations and to support the retrofit of buildings.

To date, the main practitioner use of EnergyPlus has been for new construction design. With the new high priority attached by USDOE to retrofit and improved operation of existing buildings, there is a need to extend the capabilities of EnergyPlus to model existing buildings, including faulty operation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Retrofit analysis: starts with calibrated simulation; the ability to estimate the severity of common faults is expected to improve the accuracy and transparency of the calibrated model and hence the increase accuracy of the analysis of different retrofit measures.
\item
  Commissioning providers can use the fault models to demonstrate the saving to be expected from fixing faults found in retro-commissioning
\item
  Support for building operation by using the calibrated model, including unfixed faults, as a real-time reference model to detect, and verify the diagnosis of, newly occurring faults.
\end{itemize}

The users in these cases are practitioners, not power users, so it is needed to implement the fault models using conventional EnergyPlus objects rather than the EMS, which, in any case, could only be used to model limited types of faults.

\subsection{Overview of Operational Fault Objects}\label{operational-fault-objects}

EnergyPlus contains a number of objects to model operational faults of sensors, meters, equipment and systems. The current implementation allows the modeling of the following fault types: (1) sensor faults with air economizers, (2) thermostat/humidistat offset faults, (3) fouling or scaling at air side or water side components (e.g., heating and cooling coil, air filter, cooling tower), (4) sensor faults with plant components.

The objects used by EnergyPlus to model the faults are as follows:

\paragraph{Field: Pressure Fraction Schedule Name}\label{field-pressure-fraction-schedule-name}

This field provides the name of a schedule that describes the pressure rise variations of the fan associated with the fouling air filter. This is used as a multiplier to the fan design pressure rise. Because the fan pressure rise in the faulty case is higher than that in the design case, this schedule should be set to a value that is greater than 1.0 when a fault is applicable. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1.0 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Fan Curve Name}\label{field-fan-curve-name}

This field provides the name of a fan curve for the fan associated with the fault. The curve describes the relationship between the fan pressure rise and air flow rate.

For variable speed fans, the curve should be the one corresponding to the maximum fan speed. The fan curve should cover the design operational point specified in the corresponding fan object. It is also required that the faulty fan operatinal state point falls within the fan selection range that is monotonically decreasing.

\subsection{FaultModel:Fouling:EvaporativeCooler}\label{faultmodelfoulingevapcooler}

This object defines the operational fault of the wetted coil evaporative cooler.

\subsubsection{Inputs}

\paragraph{Field: Name}

This is the user-defined name of the fault.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}

This field provides the name of a schedule that will determine if this fault is applicable. When a fault is not applicable it is not modeled in the simulations. When it is applicable, then a user-defined sensor offset and a severity schedule will be applied. This schedule should be set to 1.0 when a fault is applicable and 0.0 when it is not. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Severity Schedule Name}\label{field-severity-schedule-name}

This field provides the name of a schedule that represents severity of a fault. This schedule should be set to a non-zero value when a fault is applicable and 0.0 when it is not. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
This is used to increase or decrease the fouling by a percentage. For example, if the schedule has a value of 1.2, it implies 20\% more fouling: if the Fouling Factor is 0.8, then resulting Fouling Factor would be $0.8 / 1.2 = 0.67$.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Cooler Object Type}\label{field-evaporative cooler-object-type}

This field defines the evaporative cooler object type that this fault is associated with. Choices are the wetted coil evaporative coolers. 

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Cooler Object Name}\label{field-evaporative cooler-object-name}

This field defines the name of the evaporative cooler object associated with the fault. It should be one of the objects with the defined types.

\paragraph{Field: Fouling Factor}\label{field-fouling-factor}

This field defines the fouling factor of the faulty evaporative cooler. The factor indicates the decrease of the indirect stage efficiency. It is the ratio between the indirect stage efficiency at fouling case and that at fault free case.

\subsection{FaultModel:TemperatureSensorOffset:CoilSupplyAir}\label{faultmodeltemperaturesensoroffsetcoilsupplyair}

This object defines the operational fault of supply air temperature sensor offset for the coils with temperature-based control.

\subsubsection{Inputs}

\paragraph{Field: Name}

This is the user-defined name of the fault.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}

This field provides the name of a schedule that will determine if this fault is applicable. When a fault is not applicable it is not modeled in the simulations. When it is applicable, then a user-defined sensor offset and a severity schedule will be applied. This schedule should be set to 1.0 when a fault is applicable and 0.0 when it is not. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Severity Schedule Name}\label{field-severity-schedule-name}

This field provides the name of a schedule that represents severity of a fault. This is used as a multiplier to the user-defined temperature offset. This schedule should be set to a non-zero value when a fault is applicable and 0.0 when it is not. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Coil Object Type}\label{field-coil-object-type}

This field defines the coil object type that this fault is associated with. Choices are from a list of applicable coils with temperature-based control, including Coil:Heating:Electric, Coil:Heating:Gas, Coil:Heating:Steam, Coil:Heating:Desuperheater, Coil:Heating:Water, Coil:Cooling:Water, Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry and AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem using set point control.

\paragraph{Field: Coil Object Name}\label{field-coil-object-name}

This field defines the name of the coil associated with the fault. It should be one of the objects with the defined types.

\paragraph{Field: Water Coil Controller Name}\label{field-water-coil-controller-name}

This field defines the name of the water coil controller associated with the faulty water coil. This field is only required for the water coils, i.e., the coil type is Coil:Heating:Water, Coil:Cooling:Water, or Coil:Cooling:Water:Detailedgeometry.

\paragraph{Field: Reference Sensor Offset}\label{field-reference-sensor-offset}

This field defines the reference offset of the temperature sensor. A positive value means the sensor reads a temperature that is higher than the real value. A negative value means the sensor reads a temperature that is lower than the real value. A 0.0 value means no offset. Default is 0.0. The units are in degrees Celsius.
