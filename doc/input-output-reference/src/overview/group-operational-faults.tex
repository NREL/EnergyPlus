\section{Group - Operational Faults}\label{group---operational-faults}

\subsection{Introduction to Operational Faults Modeling}\label{introduction-to-operational-faults-modeling}

Most of the buildings, either new or old, have operational faults in the sensors, controllers, meters, equipment and systems. Being able to model and simulate these faults and their impact on energy performance of buildings is crucial to improve accuracy of building simulations and to support the retrofit of buildings.

To date, the main practitioner use of EnergyPlus has been for new construction design. With the new high priority attached by USDOE to retrofit and improved operation of existing buildings, there is a need to extend the capabilities of EnergyPlus to model existing buildings, including faulty operation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Retrofit analysis: starts with calibrated simulation; the ability to estimate the severity of common faults is expected to improve the accuracy and transparency of the calibrated model and hence the increase accuracy of the analysis of different retrofit measures.
\item
  Commissioning providers can use the fault models to demonstrate the saving to be expected from fixing faults found in retro-commissioning
\item
  Support for building operation by using the calibrated model, including unfixed faults, as a real-time reference model to detect, and verify the diagnosis of, newly occurring faults.
\end{itemize}

The users in these cases are practitioners, not power users, so it is needed to implement the fault models using conventional EnergyPlus objects rather than the EMS, which, in any case, could only be used to model limited types of faults.

\subsection{Operational Fault Objects}\label{operational-fault-objects}

EnergyPlus contains a number of objects to model operational faults of sensors, meters, equipment and systems. The current implementation allows the modeling of the following fault types: (1) sensor faults with air economizers, (2) thermostat/humidistat offset faults, and (3) heating and cooling coil fouling faults.

The objects used by EnergyPlus to model the faults are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  FaultModel:TemperatureSensorOffset:OutdoorAir
\item
  FaultModel:HumiditySensorOffset:OutdoorAir
\item
  FaultModel:EnthalpySensorOffset:OutdoorAir
\item
  FaultModel:TemperatureSensorOffset:ReturnAir
\item
  FaultModel:EnthalpySensorOffset:ReturnAir
\item
  FaultModel:Fouling:Coil
\item
  FaultModel:ThermostatOffset
\item
  FaultModel:HumidistatOffset
\end{itemize}

This field provides the name of a schedule that describes the pressure rise variations of the fan associated with the fouling air filter. This is used as a multiplier to the fan design pressure rise. Because the fan pressure rise in the faulty case is higher than that in the design case, this schedule should be set to a value that is greater than 1.0 when a fault is applicable. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1.0 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Fan Curve Name}\label{field-fan-curve-name}

This field provides the name of a fan curve for the fan associated with the fault. The curve describes the relationship between the fan pressure rise and air flow rate.

For variable speed fans, the curve should be the one corresponding to the maximum fan speed. The fan curve should cover the design operational point specified in the corresponding fan object. It is also required that the faulty fan operatinal state point falls within the fan selection range that is monotonically decreasing.
