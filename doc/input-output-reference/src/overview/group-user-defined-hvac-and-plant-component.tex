\section{Group User Defined HVAC and Plant Component Models}\label{group-user-defined-hvac-and-plant-component-models}

This group of EnergyPlus input objects provides methods for users to include their own custom models for HVAC and plant components as well as plant equipment operation. This is helpful because not every conceivable type of HVAC equipment or system configuration has already had models implemented in EnergyPlus. HVAC or plant components, or even entire system configurations, might be so new, unusual, or proprietary that no model has yet been implemented in the software. An analyst faced with project that needs to model such a device or system could do so using one or more of the user defined components described in this section.

Some building energy performance rating systems allow analysts to option of using exceptional calculation methods when a simulation program cannot perform the function required to be modeled. These user defined component models are intended to provide a means for including such exceptional calculations within the context of a full EnergyPlus model. This allows using EnergyPlus for everything it can model and extending it yourself to include a new type of HVAC or Plant component.

These objects are advanced. Making good use of them requires the user to have a detailed understanding of EnergyPlus HVAC and Plant models as well as the Energy Management System (EMS). The EnergyPlus Runtime Language (Erl) is used to program the component model. The Application Guide for EMS provides more discussion of how to use the objects in this group see the chapter called User-Defined Component Models.

\subsection{PlantEquipmentOperation:UserDefined}\label{plantequipmentoperationuserdefined}

This object is used to define a generic plant equipment operation scheme. The PlantEquipmentOperation:UserDefined object appears directly in either a \hyperref[plantequipmentoperationschemes]{PlantEquipmentOperationSchemes} or a \hyperref[condenserequipmentoperationschemes]{CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes} object. The user can configure exactly how supply side equipment is dispatched to meet loads by writing EnergyPlus Runtime Language programs and using the EMS features. There are no output variables specifically associated with this object but the outcome of load distribution actuators can be examined using the output variable called Plant Component Distributed Demand Rate.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-047}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-4-032}

This field specifies the unique user-assigned name of the custom operation scheme.

\paragraph{Field: Main Model Program Calling Manager Name}\label{field-main-model-program-calling-manager-name-1}

This field specifies the Erl programs that are used to model the custom plant operation scheme. The field should contain the name of an \hyperref[energymanagementsystemprogramcallingmanager]{EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager} that is defined elsewhere. The program manager referenced here should include all the Erl programs that are to be run each time the operation scheme is simulated and use the calling point called UserDefinedComponentModel.

\paragraph{Field: Initialization Program Calling Manager Name}\label{field-initialization-program-calling-manager-name}

This field specifies the Erl programs that are used to initialize and do an one-time setup needed for the custom operation scheme. This field should contain the name of an \hyperref[energymanagementsystemprogramcallingmanager]{EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager} that is defined elsewhere and uses the calling point called UserDefinedComponentModel. The program manager referenced here should include all the Erl programs that are needed to do any initial setup that should occur before the main programs are run. These include calculating and setting values for things that do not vary over time such as component capacities, control range parameters, various constants etc. The user defined operation scheme will trigger this calling manager at the beginning of each new environment period.

\paragraph{Field Set: (Equipment Object Type, Equipment Name)}\label{field-set-equipment-object-type-equipment-name}

Up to ten pairs of fields can be used to define the equipment governed by this custom operation scheme.

\paragraph{Field: Equipment \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Object Type}\label{field-equipment-object-type-000}

This field specifies the type of equipment, or object name, for each machine to be controlled by the scheme.

\paragraph{Field: Equipment \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-equipment-name-000}

This field specifies the user selected name of the equipment to be controlled by the scheme.

The following example shows control of a chilled water plant with two chillers that have different sizes and load dispatch is scaled so that each chiller runs at the same part load ratio.
