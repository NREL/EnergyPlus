\section{Group -- Refrigeration}\label{group-refrigeration}

There are two ways to model a supermarket refrigeration system.~ The first, and simplest, approach models the combination of compressor(s) and condenser as a single refrigeration compressor rack object. (A list is used to enter multiple case or walk-in names.)

For the first approach, the input objects needed are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item  One Refrigeration:CompressorRack object
  \item  At least one refrigeration load, which may be any combination of:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  Refrigeration:Case or
    \item  Refrigeration:WalkIn or
    \item  Refrigeration:CaseAndWalkInList objects .
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The second approach requires more input objects but also allows the user to model more complex systems.~ This detailed approach must be used whenever loads are transferred from one system to another, such as with secondary loops, cascade condensers, or mechanical subcoolers. Again lists are used to enter multiple load or compressor names.

For the detailed approach, the input objects needed are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item  One Refrigeration:System object
  \item  At least one refrigeration load object which may include any combination of:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  Refrigeration:Case,
    \item  Refrigeration:WalkIn,
    \item  Refrigeration:CaseAndWalkInList (may include any combination of cases and walk in cooler names, OR, a list of air chiller names)
    \item  Refrigeration:SecondarySystem,
    \item  Refrigeration:Condenser:Cascade (as a load, cooling a lower-temperature system) objects,
    \item  Refrigeration:TransferLoadList (may include cascade condenser loads and/or secondary loop loads)
    \item  Refrigeration:AirChiller
  \end{itemize}
  \item  At least one Refrigeration:Compressor object (multiple compressors are entered using a Refrigeration:CompressorList),
  \item  One condenser object which may be either:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  Refrigeration:Condenser:AirCooled,
    \item  Refrigeration:Condenser:EvaporativeCooled,
    \item  Refrigeration:Condenser:WaterCooled, or
    \item  Refrigeration:Condenser:Cascade (rejecting heat from this system)
  \end{itemize}
  \item  The object Refrigeration:Subcooler may optionally be included to describe either a liquid suction or mechanical subcooler.
\end{itemize}

Output variables are also available to describe the total heat exchange between all refrigeration objects and the zones containing these objects. These variables are described at the end of this section after all the refrigeration objects.

\subsection{Refrigeration:CompressorRack}\label{refrigerationcompressorrack}

The refrigeration compressor rack object works in conjunction with the refrigeration case and walkin objects (Ref. Refrigeration:Case and Refrigeration:WalkIn) to simulate the performance of a refrigerated case system. This object models the electric consumption of the rack compressors and the condenser fans. Heat removed from the refrigerated cases, walkins, and compressor/condenser fan heat can be rejected either outdoors or to a zone. Compressor rack waste heat can also be reclaimed for use by an optional air- or water-heating coil (Ref. Coil:Heating:Desuperheater and Coil:WaterHeating:Desuperheater).

If heat is rejected outdoors, condenser cooling can either be accomplished by direct air flow, evaporative water cooling, or a by water-cooled condenser with appropriate plant loop piping. With evaporative cooling, water is sprayed through the air stream to effectively lower the air temperature experienced by the condenser coil as a result of water evaporation. The use of a water-cooled condenser requires the definition of a plant loop to supply cooling to the condenser.~ Waste heat can be reclaimed and stored using a water storage device.

The inputs for the compressor rack object include a name, the heat rejection location, the compressor rack coefficient of performance (COP) at design conditions, the design condenser fan power, and the type of condenser cooling. The model requires two curve objects to describe performance at off-design conditions. If the condenser is water-cooled, the inlet and outlet node names as well as the water outlet temperature schedule name are required.~ If the condenser has evaporative cooling, additional inputs for evaporative condenser effectiveness, condenser air flow rate, basin heater parameters, water pump power, water source, and an evaporative cooling availability schedule are available. The names of refrigerated cases and walkins connected to the compressor rack are the final inputs to the model.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-039}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-038}

A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a refrigeration compressor rack. Any reference to this compressor rack by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Rejection Location}\label{field-heat-rejection-location}

The location of the compressor rack's condenser. The compressor rack condenser heat can be directed ``Outdoors'' to model an outdoor air or water-cooled condenser or ``Zone'' to model a condenser located in a zone (e.g., a stand-alone packaged refrigerated case with integral condenser located in a conditioned zone). The default for this field is ``Outdoors''. If the heat rejection location is ``Zone'' and no walk-in coolers are served by this compressor rack, then all refrigerated cases connected to this compressor rack must be located in the same zone. If however, walk-in coolers are also served by this compressor rack, then the heat rejection zone name must be specified (see Heat Rejection Zone Name field below) and cases and walk-ins can be located in multiple zones.

NOTE: When modeling a heat reclaim coil, the heat rejection location must be ``Outdoors''. If the heat rejection location is ``Zone'', the total amount of waste heat available for reclaim (e.g., by a desuperheater heating coil) is set to zero by this compressor rack object and the simulation proceeds.

\paragraph{Field: Design Compressor Rack COP}\label{field-design-compressor-rack-cop}

The coefficient of performance (COP) for the compressor rack at design conditions (compressors only, excluding condenser fan power). This value must be greater than zero, with a default value of 2.0 if this field is left blank. This value should represent the compressor rack COP corresponding to the lowest evaporating temperature of any case or walkin served by the rack.

\paragraph{Field: Compressor Rack COP Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-compressor-rack-cop-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

The name of the curve object defining the change in compressor rack COP as a function of the temperature of air entering the condenser. The curve object will be evaluated using the zone air dry-bulb temperature when rack heat rejection location equals ``Zone'' and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature when rack heat rejection location equals ``Outdoors'' and the condenser type is air-cooled. As explained below, if the condenser is cooled by evaporative or water loop cooling, the curve object is evaluated using an effective temperature. The output from this curve is multiplied by the design compressor rack COP to yield the actual COP at the specific air temperature entering the condenser. This curve must be cubic or quadratic (Curve:Cubic or Curve:Quadratic), and should be normalized to 1.0 at the condenser entering air temperature at which the design compressor rack COP occurs. This curve should represent the compressor rack COP corresponding to the lowest evaporating temperature of any case served by the rack.

\paragraph{Field: Design Condenser Fan Power}\label{field-design-condenser-fan-power}

This field defines the design power for the condenser fan(s) in Watts. This field is applicable for air or evaporative cooling only.~ If the condenser is water-cooled, the fan power is captured in the cooling object (e.g., cooling tower).~ If applicable, this value must be greater than 0.0, with a default value of 250 Watts if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Fan Power Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-condenser-fan-power-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This field is the name of the curve object defining the change in condenser fan power as a function of the temperature of air entering the condenser. This curve is used to simulate the modulation of air flow by the condenser fans (e.g., staging, multi-speed, or variable speed) as a function of temperature.~ The curve object will be evaluated using the zone air dry-bulb temperature when rack heat rejection location equals ``Zone'' and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature when rack heat rejection location equals ``Outdoors'' and the condenser type is air-cooled. As explained below, if the condenser is cooled by evaporative cooling, the curve object is evaluated using an effective temperature. The output from this curve is multiplied by the design condenser fan power to yield the actual fan power at the specific air temperature entering the condenser. This curve must be cubic or quadratic (Curve:Cubic or Curve:Quadratic), and should be normalized to 1.0 at the condenser entering air temperature at which the design condenser fan power occurs. The actual condenser fan power is not allowed to exceed the design condenser fan power defined in the previous input field or go below zero (i.e., the output of the curve object is limited to values from 0.0 to 1.0). If this field is left blank, then the model assumes the condenser fan power is at the design power level when any of the refrigerated cases connected to this rack are operating.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Type}\label{field-condenser-type-002}

When the heat rejection location is ``Outdoors'', the condenser may be either cooled by dry air by specifying ``AirCooled'', by wet evaporative cooling by specifying ``EvaporativelyCooled'', or by a water loop by specifying ``WaterCooled''.~ If the condenser type is ``WaterCooled'', then a plant cooling loop will need to be defined using other EnergyPlus objects, e.g., plant loop, pump, cooling tower, etc.~ The default value is ``AirCooled''.

\paragraph{Field: Water-cooled Condenser Inlet Node Name}\label{field-water-cooled-condenser-inlet-node-name}

When the condenser type is ``WaterCooled'', a node name for the water-side condenser inlet must be provided.

\paragraph{Field: Water-cooled Condenser Outlet Node Name}\label{field-water-cooled-condenser-outlet-node-name}

When the condenser type is ``WaterCooled'', a node name for the water-side condenser outlet must be provided.

\paragraph{Field: Water-cooled Loop Flow Type}\label{field-water-cooled-loop-flow-type}

When the condenser type is ``WaterCooled'', the type of flow loop should be specified.~ The two choices are \textbf{VariableFlow}, in which a Pump:VariableSpeed needs to~ be included in the plant loop, or \textbf{ConstantFlow}, in which the loop circuit has a constant flow rate, typically associated with a Pump:ConstantSpeed object.~ If the flow type is VariableFlow, the flow needed to remove the condenser heat energy will be calculated and requested of the pump.~ If the flow type is Constant Flow, the outlet water temperature will be determined based on the fixed loop flow rate and heat energy to be removed.~ The default type is \textbf{VariableFlow}. Refer to additional discussion in the Engineering Reference.

\paragraph{Field: Water-cooled Condenser Outlet Temperature Schedule Name}\label{field-water-cooled-condenser-outlet-temperature-schedule-name}

When the condenser type is ``WaterCooled'', and when the water-cooled loop flow type is ``Variable Flow'', the name of a schedule (Ref: Schedule) that defines the desired condenser water outlet temperature must be provided.~ The schedule may define an outlet temperature that varies through time.

\paragraph{Field: Water-cooled Condenser Design~ Flow Rate}\label{field-water-cooled-condenser-design-flow-rate}

When the condenser type is ``WaterCooled'', and when the water-cooled loop flow type is ``Constant Flow'', this is the design water flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s that will be requested initially.~ This requested flow will be passed to the loop simulation, and resulting actual flow will be dependent upon supply system capabilities (e.g., pump capability).~ The design flow rate must always be less than the maximum flow rate, defined below.

\paragraph{Field: Water-cooled Condenser Maximum~ Flow Rate}\label{field-water-cooled-condenser-maximum-flow-rate}

When the condenser type is ``Water Cooled'', this is the maximum water flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s that will be allowed through the condenser.~ When the loop flow type is Variable Flow, if the calculated flow rate is higher than the maximum flow rate, an error message will be generated, and the flow rate will be reset to the maximum flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Water-cooled Condenser Maximum Water Outlet Temperature}\label{field-water-cooled-condenser-maximum-water-outlet-temperature}

When the condenser type is ``WaterCooled'', this field specifies the maximum allowed water temperature in degrees C leaving the compressor rack condenser. The default value is 55 degrees C.

\paragraph{Field: Water-cooled Condenser Minimum Water Inlet Temperature}\label{field-water-cooled-condenser-minimum-water-inlet-temperature}

When the condenser type is ``WaterCooled'', this field specifies the minimum allowed water temperature in degrees C entering the compressor rack condenser. The default value is 10 degrees C.~ Refer to additional discussion in the Engineering Reference.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-availability-schedule-name}

When the condenser type is ``EvaporativelyCooled'', the name of the optional schedule (Ref: Schedule) that specifies the time periods that evaporative cooling is available/unavailable. In some colder climates, evaporative cooling is periodically discontinued and the basin sumps drained to avoid freezing. In these times, the condenser runs as a typical dry air cooled condenser, and related evaporative cooling systems (e.g., water pump, basin heaters) do not operate. Use of this optional schedule permits modeling of planned, seasonal interruptions of evaporative cooling. All schedule values must be greater than or equal to zero. Typically, an ON/OFF schedule type is used with values being either 0 or 1. A schedule value of 1 indicates that evaporative cooling is available during the defined time period, and a value of 0 denotes that evaporative cooling is not available during the defined time period. If the schedule name is omitted (blank) and Condenser Type = ``Evap Cooled'', then the model assumes that evaporative cooling of the condenser is available for the entire simulation period.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness-001}

When the condenser type is ``EvaporativelyCooled'', this field specifies the effectiveness of the evaporative system in modifying the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil. The resulting effective temperature is determined as

\begin{equation}
{T_{effective}} = {T_{owb}} + (1 - \varepsilon )*[{T_{odb}} - {T_{owb}}]
\end{equation}

where:

\({T_{effective}}\) ~~~~~~ = effective dry-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser cooling coil (°C)

\({T_{owb}}\) ~~~~~~~~~~ = outdoor air wet-bulb temperature (°C)

\({T_{odb}}\) ~~~~~~~~~~ = outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (°C)

\(\varepsilon\) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ = evaporative condenser effectiveness.

The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Compressor Rack COP as a Function of Temperature Curve and the Condenser Fan Power as a Function of Temperature Curve. The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0.

If the two function-of-temperature curves (i.e., Compressor Rack COP as a Function of Temperature Curve and Condenser Fan Power as a Function of Temperature Curve) are based on wet-bulb temperature rather than dry-bulb temperature, the evaporative condenser effectiveness should be set to 1.0 for consistency.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-air-flow-rate-001}

When the condenser type is ``EvaporativelyCooled'', the air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\)per second, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water evaporated when evaporatively cooling the condenser inlet air. The value for this field must be greater than zero. This input field is also autocalculatable, equivalent to 0.000144 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of total cooling capacity {[}850 cfm/ton{]} where the total cooling capacity is the sum of the rated total cooling capacities for the refrigerated cases connected to this compressor rack (Ref. Refrigeration:Case).

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-003}

When the condenser type is ``EvaporativelyCooled'', this field defines the power level of the basin heater, if applicable, used to avoid water freezing in an outdoor evaporative cooler basin. This numeric field contains the capacity of the electric basin heater in Watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Set Point Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the dry-bulb temperature of the condenser coil inlet air. The basin heater only operates when the condenser fan is off (i.e., no compressor heat rejection). The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of 200 W/K if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-003}

When the condenser type is ``EvaporativelyCooled'', this numeric field contains the set point temperature (°C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this set point temperature, as long as the condenser fan is off. The default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Design Evaporative Condenser Water Pump Power}\label{field-design-evaporative-condenser-water-pump-power}

When the condenser type is ``EvaporativelyCooled'', the rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The value for this field must be greater than or equal to 0, with a default value of 1000 Watts if this field is left blank. This input field is also autocalculatable, equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt {[}15 W/ton{]} of total cooling capacity where the total cooling capacity is the sum of the rated total cooling capacities for the refrigerated cases and walk-ins connected to this compressor rack (Ref. Refrigeration:Case and Refrigeration:WalkIn)).

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Water Supply Tank Name}\label{field-evaporative-water-supply-tank-name}

When the condenser type is ``EvaporativelyCooled'', this field is used to define where the compressor rack obtains water used for evaporative cooling of its condenser. If this field is left blank, the unit will obtain water directly from the mains (Ref. Water Mains Temperatures). If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the unit will obtain its water from that tank.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-condenser-air-inlet-node-name-000}

This optional alpha field contains the name of the node from which the outdoor compressor rack condenser draws its outdoor air. This field is applicable only when the heat rejection location is ``Outdoors'' (if the heat rejection location is ``Zone'', this field is disregarded). If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, this node name must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-003}

This field allows the specification of a user-defined end-use subcategory (e.g., ``Low Temperature Rack''). A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (Ref: Output:Meter objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table.  If this field is left blank, the equipment will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

\paragraph{Field: Refrigeration Case Name or WalkIn Name or CaseAndWalkInList Name}\label{field-refrigeration-case-name-or-walkin-name-or-caseandwalkinlist-name}

This alpha field is the name of a single refrigerated case, a single walk in cooler,~ the name of a CaseAndWalkInList for multiple refrigerated cases and/or walk-ins, the name of a refrigeration chiller, or the name of a CaseAndWalkInList for multiple refrigeration chillers connected to this compressor rack. Note that if a CaseAndWalkInList contains the name(s) of refrigeration chillers, it CANNOT have the name(s) or any refrigerated cases or walkins . This field is required.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Rejection Zone Name}\label{field-heat-rejection-zone-name}

If the Heat Rejection Location is ``Zone'' and any walk-in coolers are connected to this compressor rack, then this field is required. The compressor rack heat rejection will impact the air heat balance in this zone.

The following is an example input for a~ Refrigeration Compressor Rack with water cooled condenser.

\subsection{Refrigeration:Case}\label{refrigerationcase}

The Refrigeration Case object works in conjunction with a compressor rack, a refrigeration system, or a secondary loop object (Refrigeration:CompressorRack, Refrigeration:System, or Refrigeration:SecondarySystem) to simulate the performance of a refrigerated case system. The refrigerated case model uses performance information at rated conditions along with performance curves for latent case credits and defrost heat load to determine performance at off-rated conditions. Energy use for lights, fans and anti-sweat heaters is modeled based on inputs for nominal power, schedules, and control type. The refrigerated case model accounts for the sensible and latent heat exchange with the surrounding environment (termed ``case credits'') which impacts the temperature and humidity in the zone where the case is located.

\textbf{\emph{A dataset has been provided containing refrigerated case input data for a large number of refrigerated cases from multiple manufacturers. See RefrigerationCases.idf.}}

The Refrigeration Case object inputs include a case name, an availability schedule name, the zone name for the location of the case, and the temperature and relative humidity of the ambient (zone) air surrounding the refrigerated case at the rating conditions for case performance. Additional inputs include the total cooling capacity, latent heat ratio, and run time fraction of the refrigerated case at rated conditions. The case length and operating temperature (average temperature of air/products within the case) must also be specified.

The refrigerated case model requires two curves to describe performance at off-rated conditions (i.e., at different zone temperature and humidity levels): the latent case credit curve and the defrost energy correction curve. The user must enter cubic performance curves with the independent variable being user selectable (case temperature, zone relative humidity, or zone dewpoint temperature).

The user can select from eight case defrost types, with additional inputs being required depending on the type selected. The user must enter a defrost schedule (unless Case Defrost Type = None), and an optional defrost drip-down schedule can be specified to allow additional time for melted frost to drain from the cooling coil following the regular defrost period.

Inputs are required for case fans, lights, and anti-sweat heaters. Case lighting can be controlled by the user through entering a schedule. The case fans operate whenever the cooling coil is operating and during defrost periods for certain case defrost types. Anti-sweat heater power can be controlled by several methods which are user selectable. The model assumes that the fans are contained within the thermal envelope of the case and provide a direct heat load on the case cooling coil. For lighting and anti-sweat heaters, the user can specify the fraction of their respective heat loads that directly impact the case cooling coil (with the remainder of their heat load impacting the surrounding zone air).

The user has the option of specifying a case restocking schedule and a schedule for modifying the case credits if needed. Finally, the user can specify the under case HVAC return air fraction which determines the portion of the case credits that directly impact the HVAC return air conditions (with the remainder of the case credits impacting the zone sensible and latent loads).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-036}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-035}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the refrigerated case can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (maximum schedule value of 1.0 is typically used) indicates that the case will operate during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the case does not operate (everything is OFF: refrigeration, fans, lights, anti-sweat, etc.). Typically the refrigerated case will operate throughout the day (i.e., the schedule will contain 1 for all time periods); however, cases require maintenance and/or cleaning and this can be modeled accordingly using this schedule if desired. If this field is left blank, the case is assumed to be available at all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-010}

The name of the zone where the refrigerated case is located. The refrigerated case will impact the air heat balance in this zone.

\paragraph{Field: Case Lighting Schedule Name}\label{field-case-lighting-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes the fraction of installed refrigerated case lights that operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the lights will operate during that time period (maximum schedule value of 1.0 means lights are fully on at the Installed Case Lighting Power per Unit Length level). A schedule value of zero denotes that the lights are off. The refrigerated case lights will typically operate only when the store is open for business and can be scheduled off as desired via this schedule. If this field is left blank, the default schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction of Lighting Energy To Case}\label{field-fraction-of-lighting-energy-to-case}

The fraction of the lighting energy that directly contributes to the case heat load. The remainder of the lighting energy (1 -- fraction) is a heating load to the zone where the case is located.

\paragraph{Field: Case Defrost Power per Unit Length}\label{field-case-defrost-power-per-unit-length}

The defrost power in watts per unit length of refrigerated case (W/m). This input is required for hot-gas, hot-fluid, or electric defrost types and is used to evaluate the load on the case as well as power or heat consumption. Refrigerated case manufacturers do not typically provide information on the heat input for hot-gas and hot-fluid defrost. Information provided for electric defrost power can be substituted here for refrigerated cases using hot-gas or hot-fluid defrost if other information is not available. Only electric Case Defrost Types consume electricity during the defrost period. The entered value for this field must be greater than or equal to zero, and the default value is 0 W/m if the field is blank.

\paragraph{Field: Case Defrost Type}\label{field-case-defrost-type}

The type of defrost used for this refrigerated case.

The default defrost type is OffCycle if the field is blank. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the different case defrost types are modeled. In particular, hot-fluid defrost systems may be effective with much shorter defrost times than other systems, which should be reflected in the defrost and drip-down schedules.

\paragraph{Field: Case Defrost Schedule Name}\label{field-case-defrost-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the refrigerated case requires defrosting. A schedule value of 1.0 indicates that defrost will be on during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the defrost is off. Defrost schedules normally repeat the duration and number of defrost cycles for each day of the year. The refrigerated case manufacturer typically provides this information with the product literature. The use of Compact Schedules (ref. Schedules) are ideal for this purpose. In a typical supermarket with many cases, it is important to diversify the defrost schedules in order to avoid large swings in the load placed upon the remainder of the refrigeration system.

\paragraph{Field: Case Defrost Drip-Down Schedule Name}\label{field-case-defrost-drip-down-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the refrigerated case requires additional time for draining condensate after the defrost period. A schedule value of 1.0 indicates that the defrost drip-down period is on during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the defrost drip-down period is over. The refrigerated case manufacturer typically provides this information with the product literature.

Each defrost drip-down period specified in this schedule should start at the same time as the corresponding defrost period specified in the schedule for Case Defrost Schedule, and the drip-down schedule defrost period should always be longer than or equal to the length of the defrost schedule time period. For example, if the case defrost schedule contains a defrost period from 7:00 to 7:15, you would specify a case defrost drip-down period from 7:00 to 7:20 if you wanted to model a 5 minute condensate drip-down period after the regular defrost period. If no drip-down schedule is entered, then the case defrost schedule (specified for the previous input field) will be used. The use of Compact Schedules (ref. Schedules) are ideal for this purpose.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Energy Correction Curve Type}\label{field-defrost-energy-correction-curve-type}

This alpha field defines the form of the correction curve used to modify the defrost energy use (and the associated load on the case cooling coil) at off-rated conditions. The valid choices for this field are:

\end{itemize}

This choice specifies that a defrost energy correction curve will not be used.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  CaseTemperatureMethod
\end{itemize}

This method defines the variation in defrost energy as a cubic function of Case Operating Temperature. The result from the cubic curve is multiplied by the difference between the rated ambient relative humidity and the actual zone relative humidity, and one minus this value is multiplied by the Case Defrost Power to give the (average) operating defrost power at the actual zone humidity condition. (Representative cooefficient values for single-shelf horizontal and multi-shelf vertical display cases are given in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  RelativeHumidityMethod
\end{itemize}

This method defines the variation in defrost energy as a cubic function of ambient (zone) air relative humidity.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

The default curve type is None. The methods described here (e.g.~Case Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Dewpoint) are applicable only to Electric with Temperature Termination, Hot-Gas with Temperature Termination, and Hot-Brine with Temperature Termination case defrost types. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the defrost energy correction types are modeled.

The name of a \textbf{cubic} performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the defrost energy (and the associated load on the case cooling coil) at off-rated conditions. The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rated ambient air conditions defined above. The defrost energy correction curve name is used only for the Electric with Temperature Termination, Hot-Gas with Temperature Termination, and Hot-Brine with Temperature Termination case defrost types.

\paragraph{Field: Under Case HVAC Return Air Fraction}\label{field-under-case-hvac-return-air-fraction}

This field denotes the fraction of HVAC system (air loop) return air that passes beneath the refrigerated case, if any. At times it is necessary to design HVAC systems with under case returns to avoid overcooling the area around the refrigerated case, thus providing a more comfortable environment for the zone occupants. This return air fraction affects the portion of the case credits (sensible and latent) that are applied to the air returning to the HVAC system, while the remainder of the case credits directly impacts the zone air heat balance. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how this is modeled. The sum of the Under Case HVAC Return Air Fractions for all refrigerated cases located in a single zone must be less than or equal to 1.0. The value for this field can range from zero to 1.0, with a default value of 0 if the field is blank. The return air node name may be specified below.

\paragraph{Field: Refrigerated Case Restocking Schedule Name}\label{field-refrigerated-case-restocking-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the refrigerated case is being restocked with product. The schedule should contain values in units of Watts per unit length of refrigerated case (W/m). This field can be used to denote the additional load imposed on the refrigerated case from stocking the case with product that is warmer than the refrigerated case temperature. This information is difficult to find and may require additional research for proper modeling; however, this schedule is available for this purpose if desired. If restocking of the refrigerated case will not be simulated, enter a schedule with values of zero for all time periods or leave this field blank.

\paragraph{Field: Case Credit Fraction Schedule Name}\label{field-case-credit-fraction-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes a fraction of both the sensible and latent case credits to be applied to the zone and/or the HVAC system return air. Schedule values must be from 0 to 1. This allows correction of the case credits for various refrigerated case types. For instance, if glass door refrigerated display cases are installed in a store that is operated 12 hours per day, then the doors will remain closed during the unoccupied times and would therefore reduce the sensible and latent case credits during the unoccupied time. Leaving this field blank will result in no case credit fraction being applied during the simulation.

\paragraph{Field: Design Evaporator Temperature or Brine Inlet Temperature}\label{field-design-evaporator-temperature-or-brine-inlet-temperature}

The value of this numeric field is used only with the detailed refrigeration system and is not read for the compressor-rack system. For the refrigeration system, it is used to evaluate compressor performance and is also used when the evaporator pressure and temperature are allowed to float at loads less than the design load. If the case is cooled by a secondary system (ref: Refrigeration:SecondarySystem), this value is the brine inlet temperature. The minimum value is -70C and the maximum value is 40C.~ The default value is 5C less than the case temperature.

\paragraph{Field: Average Refrigerant Charge Inventory}\label{field-average-refrigerant-charge-inventory}

The value of this optional field is the refrigerant inventory present in the refrigerated case during ordinary operation. The value is used to produce an estimate of the total refrigerant present in the refrigeration system. The value is entered in kg/m.

\paragraph{Field: Under Case HVAC Return Air Node Name}\label{under-case-hvac-return-air-node-name}

Name of the return air node for this case. If left blank, it defaults to the first return air node for this zone.

The following is an example input for a refrigerated case.

A positive value is reported when the return air is cooled by sensible case credits, otherwise a zero is reported. If the HVAC system is off for a simulation timestep (no return air mass flow), then this sensible cooling is actually provided to the zone air instead (even though a non-zero value is reported here).

\paragraph{Refrigeration Case Return Air Sensible Cooling Energy {[}J{]}}\label{refrigeration-case-return-air-sensible-cooling-energy-j}

This field is the amount of sensible cooling case credit energy delivered to the return air duct (zone return air node) in Joules.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-033}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-2-032}

A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a CaseAndWalkInList. Any reference to this list by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Case or WalkIn or Air Chiller \textless{}x\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-case-or-walkin-or-air-chiller-x-name}

Up to 20 are provided in the IDD; this object is extensible.

The following is an example input for a CaseAndWalkInList.

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Refrigeration:WalkIn}\label{refrigerationwalkin}

The Refrigeration WalkIn object works in conjunction with a compressor rack, a refrigeration system, or a refrigeration secondary system object (Ref. Refrigeration:CompressorRack, Refrigeration:System, or Refrigeration:SecondarySystem) to simulate the performance of a walk-in cooler. The walk-in cooler model uses information at rated conditions along with input descriptions for heat transfer surfaces facing multiple zones to determine performance. Energy use for lights, fans, and floor and anti-sweat heaters is modeled based on inputs for nominal power, schedules, and control type. The walk-in cooler model accounts for the sensible and latent heat exchange with the surrounding environment (termed ``case credits'') which impacts the temperature and humidity in each zone adjacent to the walk-in.

The walk-in cooler object inputs include a name, an availability schedule name, the rated cooling capacity, the rated operating temperature, the rated cooling source temperature, the rated total heating power and heating power schedule, the rated fan and lighting power and schedules, defrost type, defrost control type, defrost schedule name, drip-down schedule name, defrost power, the portion of the defrost energy used to melt ice (only for temperature termination control type), restocking schedule, refrigerant inventory, and the floor area and U-value.

For each zone adjacent to the walk-in, the user must input the zone name and the insulated surface area and U-value facing that zone. The user must also specify, for two types of doors, the door area, height, U-value, door opening schedule name, and any door opening protection.

Under case HVAC return air fraction, available for refrigerated cases, is not available for walk-in coolers.

\subsubsection{Field: Name}\label{field-name-3-026}

A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a refrigerated walk-in. Any reference to this walk-in by another object will use this name.

\subsubsection{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-1-011}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the walk in can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (maximum schedule value of 1.0 is typically used) indicates that the walkin will operate during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the case does not operate (everything is OFF: refrigeration, fans, lights, anti-sweat, etc.). Typically the walkin will operate throughout the day (i.e., the schedule will contain 1 for all time periods); however, walkins require maintenance and/or cleaning and this can be modeled accordingly using this schedule if desired. If this field is left blank, the default schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.

\subsubsection{Field: Rated Coil Cooling Capacity}\label{field-rated-coil-cooling-capacity}

The total, full load cooling capacity (sensible plus latent) in watts (W) at rated conditions The value entered for this field must be greater than zero, with no default value.

\subsubsection{Field: Operating Temperature}\label{field-operating-temperature}

The rated average temperature of the air and products within the walk-in cooler in ˚C. The entered value for this field must be less than 20˚C. There is no default value.

\subsubsection{Field: Rated Cooling Source Temperature}\label{field-rated-cooling-source-temperature}

For a DX evaporator coil, enter the saturated evaporating temperature in ˚C.~ For a fluid coil, enter the fluid coil entrance temperature in ˚C. There is no default value. This number is used, with temperatures for other refrigeration loads on any one system, to set that system's minimum suction pressure or minimum circulating fluid temperature. (This value is not used if the walkin is cooled by a compressor rack object.)

\subsubsection{Field: Rated Total Heating Power}\label{field-rated-total-heating-power}

The total heating power in watts including all anti-sweat, door, drip-pan, and floor heaters (W). This value is required and has no default value.

\subsubsection{Field: Heating Power Schedule Name}\label{field-heating-power-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes the fraction of heater power that operates during a given time period. A schedule value of zero denotes that all heaters are off. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that some portion of the total heater power will operate during that time period (maximum schedule value of 1.0 means all heaters are fully on). For example, if door and floor heaters represent 50\% of the total heater power and are on all the time, the minimum schedule value would be 0.5. If anti-sweat heaters represent 40\% of the total heater power and are only on during certain hours, the schedule value during those hours would be increased by 0.4. If this field is left blank, the default schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.

\subsubsection{Field: Rated Cooling Coil Fan Power}\label{field-rated-cooling-coil-fan-power}

The cooling coil fan power in watts (W). This value has a default value of 375W. This fan is assumed to run continuously except during electric, hot brine, or hot gas defrost periods.

\subsubsection{Field: Rated Circulation Fan Power}\label{field-rated-circulation-fan-power}

The circulation fan power in watts (W). This value has a default value of 0 W. This fan is assumed to run continuously.

\subsubsection{Field: Rated Total Lighting Power}\label{field-rated-total-lighting-power}

The total lighting power in watts including both display and task lighting (W). This value is required and has no default value.

\subsubsection{Field: Lighting Schedule Name}\label{field-lighting-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes the fraction of walk-in lights that operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the lights will operate during that time period (maximum schedule value of 1.0 means lights are fully on). A schedule value of zero denotes that the lights are off. If this field is left blank, the default schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.

\subsubsection{Field: Defrost Type}\label{field-defrost-type}

The type of defrost used for this walk-in. Valid choices are None, Off-Cycle, HotFluid, and Electric. The default defrost type is Electric if the field is blank. HotFluid includes both hot gas and hot brine defrost systems. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the different defrost types are modeled.

\subsubsection{Field: Defrost Control Type}\label{field-defrost-control-type}

The type of defrost control used for this walkin. Valid choices are TimeSchedule and TemperatureTermination. The default is TimeSchedule if the field is blank. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the different defrost controls are modeled.

\subsubsection{Field: Defrost Schedule Name}\label{field-defrost-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes when the walkin requires defrosting. A schedule value of 1.0 indicates that defrost will be on during a given time period if the defrost control type is ``TimeSchedule''. For the TemperatureTermination defrost control type, the defrost will start with the schedule value changes from 0 to 1, but will end when the ice is melted. A value equal to 0 denotes that the defrost is off. Defrost schedules normally repeat the duration and number of defrost cycles for each day of the year. The walkin manufacturer typically provides this information with the product literature. If TemperatureTermination control type is used, the defrost schedule is used for the defrost cycle start time and the defrost cycle end time is not allowed to extend beyond the scheduled off time. The use of Compact Schedules (ref. Schedules) are ideal for this purpose.

\subsubsection{Field: Defrost Drip-Down Schedule Name}\label{field-defrost-drip-down-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the walkin requires additional time for draining condensate after the defrost period. A schedule value of 1.0 indicates that the defrost drip-down period is on during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the defrost drip-down period is over. The walkin manufacturer typically provides this information with the product literature.

Each defrost drip-down period specified in this schedule should start at the same time as the corresponding defrost period specified in the schedule for Defrost Schedule, and the drip-down schedule defrost period should always be longer than or equal to the length of the defrost schedule time period. For example, if the defrost schedule contains a defrost period from 7:00 to 7:15, you would specify a case defrost drip-down period from 7:00 to 7:20 if you wanted to model a 5 minute condensate drip-down period after the regular defrost period. If no drip-down schedule is entered, then the defrost schedule (specified for the previous input field) will be used. The use of Compact Schedules (ref. Schedules) are ideal for this purpose.

\subsubsection{Field: Defrost Power}\label{field-defrost-power}

The defrost power in watts. This input is required for hot-fluid (hot gas or hot brine), or electric defrost types. Walkin manufacturers do not typically provide information on the heat input for hot gas and hot brine defrost. Information provided for electric defrost power can be substituted here for walkins using hot-gas or hot-brine defrost if other information is not available. Only electric Defrost Types consume electricity during the defrost period. The entered value for this field must be greater than or equal to zero.

\subsubsection{Field: Temperature Termination Defrost Fraction to Ice}\label{field-temperature-termination-defrost-fraction-to-ice}

When cooling coils go through a defrost cycle, only a portion of the defrost energy is actually used to melt the ice.~ The rest of the defrost energy goes to increasing the temperature of the coils themselves and to the walkin environment. The Temperature Termination defrost control type calculates the end of the defrost cycle that corresponds to melting all the ice. Therefore, the user must input this fractional value. The default value is 0.7 for electric defrost and 0.3 for hot fluid defrost. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the defrost energy control types are modeled.

\subsubsection{Field: Restocking Schedule Name}\label{field-restocking-schedule-name}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the walkin is being restocked with product. The schedule should contain values in units of Watts (note this is different from the restocking schedule values for cases that are entered per unit length). This field can be used to denote the additional load imposed on the walkin from stocking the walkin with product that is warmer than the walkin temperature. This information is difficult to find and may required additional research for proper modeling; however, this schedule is available for this purpose if desired. If restocking of the refrigerated walkin will not be simulated, enter a schedule with values of zero for all time periods or leave this field blank.

\subsubsection{Field: Average Refrigerant Charge Inventory}\label{field-average-refrigerant-charge-inventory-1}

The value of this optional field is the refrigerant inventory present in the walkin during ordinary operation. The value is used to produce an estimate of the total refrigerant present in the refrigeration system. The value is entered in kg.

\subsubsection{Field: Insulated Floor Surface Area}\label{field-insulated-floor-surface-area}

The floor area in square meters. This value is required and has no default value.

\subsubsection{Field: Insulated Floor U-Value}\label{field-insulated-floor-u-value}

The floor themal transmittance (in W/m\(^{2}\)-K). This value has a default value of 0.3154. (This corresponds to R18 in Archaic American Insulation Units.~ To convert other R-values to thermal transmittance, divide 5.678 by the R-value.~ For example, R15 is 0.3785 W/m\(^{2}\)-K and R5 is 1.136 W/m\(^{2}\)-K.)

\textbf{\emph{THE REMAINING 12 FIELDS FOR THE WALK-IN COOLER MUST BE REPEATED FOR EACH ZONE WHICH IS IN CONTACT WITH A WALK-IN WALL, CEILING, OR DOOR. The IDD includes fields for 3 zones, but can be extended by repeating the last 12 values in the object.}}

\subsubsection{Field: Zone \textless{}x\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-zone-x-name}

The name of a zone adjoining the walkin. The walkin will impact the air heat balance in this zone. This zone must represent a conditioned space, that is, it must appear in a ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections object.

\subsubsection{Field: Total Insulated Surface Area Facing~ Zone \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-total-insulated-surface-area-facing-zone-x}

The total surface area (walls and ceilings) facing this particular zone in square meters. This value is required and has no default value.

The surface (walls and ceilings) themal transmittance (in W/m\(^{2}\)-K). This value has a default value of 0.3154. (This corresponds to R18 in Archaic American Insulation Units.~ To convert other R-values to thermal transmittance, divide 5.678 by the R-value.~ For example, R15 is 0.3785 W/m\(^{2}\)-K and R5 is 1.136 W/m\(^{2}\)-K.)

\subsubsection{Field: Area of Glass Reach In Doors Facing Zone \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-area-of-glass-reach-in-doors-facing-zone-x}

The total area of glass doors facing this particular zone in square meters. The default is 0.0.

The glass door themal transmittance (in W/m\(^{2}\)-K). This field has a default value of 1.136. (This corresponds to R5 in Archaic American Insulation Units.)

\subsubsection{Field: Glass Reach In Door Opening Schedule Name Facing Zone \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-glass-reach-in-door-opening-schedule-name-facing-zone-x}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes the fraction of time glass doors are open during a given time period. The schedule values should be between 0 and 1.0. If no schedule is specified, the doors are assumed to be open 5\% of the time (corresponding to a schedule value of 0.05).

\subsubsection{Field: Area of Stocking Doors Facing Zone \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-area-of-stocking-doors-facing-zone-x}

\subsubsection{Field: Stocking Door U-Value Facing Zone \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-stocking-door-u-value-facing-zone-x}

The stocking door themal transmittance (in W/m\(^{2}\)-K). This value has a default value of 0.3785. (This corresponds to R15 in Archaic American Insulation Units.)

\subsubsection{Field: Stocking Door Opening Schedule Name Facing Zone \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-stocking-door-opening-schedule-name-facing-zone-x}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes the fraction of time stocking doors are open during a given time period. The schedule values should be between 0 and 1.0. If no schedule is specified, the doors are assumed to be open 5\% of the time (corresponding to a schedule value of 0.05).

\subsection{Refrigeration:System}\label{refrigerationsystem}

The refrigeration system object simulates the performance of a supermarket refrigeration system when used along with other objects to define the refrigeration load(s), the compressor(s), and the condenser.

At least one refrigeration load object must be defined which may be one of four types of load, a refrigerated case, a walk-in cooler, a chiller providing refrigeration to a secondary loop, or a cascade condenser which absorbs heat rejected by a lower-temperature system (Ref. Refrigeration:Case, Refrigeration:WalkIn, Refrigeration:SecondarySystem,~ and Refrigeration:Condenser:Cascade) If multiple loads are served by the same system , the user should use one or both of the list objects available to assign loads to the system. The first list includes all cases and walkins cooled directly by this system (Ref. Refrigeration:CaseAndWalkInList). The second list includes any `transfer' loads, that is refrigeration loads borne by this system that are transferred from another refrigeration system via either a secondary loop chiller or a cascade condenser (Ref. Refrigeration:TransferLoadList, see the Engineering Reference for more information about these types of systems).

The refrigeration system object is capable of modeling both single-stage and two-stage compression refrigeration systems.~ The name of at least one compressor must be defined and a list object is available if the system is served by more than one compressor (Ref. Refrigeration:Compressor and Refrigeration:CompressorList).

Heat is rejected outdoors in a condenser by direct air flow, evaporative water cooling, by a water-cooled condenser with appropriate plant loop piping, or to a cascade condenser cooled by another refrigeration system(ref: Refrigeration:Condenser:AirCooled, Refrigeration:Condenser:EvaporativeCooled, Refrigeration:Condenser:WaterCooled, Refrigeration:Condenser:Cascade). With evaporative cooling, water is sprayed through the air stream to effectively lower the air temperature experienced by the condenser coil as a result of water evaporation. The use of a water-cooled condenser requires the definition of a plant loop to supply cooling to the condenser.~ If a cascade condenser is specified, the refrigeration system absorbing the rejected heat must also be defined.

The refrigeration system may also include a liquid suction and/or mechanical subcooler (Ref. Refrigeration:Subcooler).

The system object coordinates the energy flows between the other refrigeration objects and is used to set system parameters. Compressor waste heat can also be reclaimed for use by an optional air- or water-heating coil (Ref. Coil:Heating:Desuperheater and Coil:WaterHeating:Desuperheater).

The inputs for the refrigeration system object, in addition to the names of the other refrigeration objects described above, include a name for this system, the minimum condensing temperature, the refrigeration system working fluid, and the type of saturated suction temperature control. Optional input fields are also provided for users seeking to keep track of refrigerant inventory and suction pipe heat gains.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-3-029}

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Name}\label{field-condenser-name}

The name of the condenser that is used to \emph{reject heat from} this refrigeration system. The name will be validated against the condenser names (ref: Refrigeration:Condenser:AirCooled, Refrigeration:Condenser:WaterCooled, Refrigeration:Condenser:EvaporativeCooled, and Refrigeration:Condenser:Cascade) in the input file.

\paragraph{Field:Compressor or ~Compressor List Name}\label{fieldcompressor-or-compressor-list-name}

\paragraph{Field: Sum UA Suction Piping}\label{field-sum-ua-suction-piping}

This optional field is typically used when trying to determine the impact of pipe heat gains on system performance and zone heat balance, particularly in comparing a DX system to a secondary system. Enter the value for suction piping heat gain (in W/C).~ That is, sum up the product of the pipe wall insulation conductance times the outer surface area of the pipe insulation.

(If the previous field, Sum UA Suction Piping, is blank, this field will not be used.) Enter the name of the zone where the suction piping is located. The suction piping heat gains will be calculated based upon the air temperature within this zone. The heat balance of this zone will also be affected by the piping heat exchange.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-1-002}

This field allows the specification of a user-defined end-use subcategory (e.g., ``Low Temperature Rack'').

Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is left blank, the equipment will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

\subsection{Refrigeration:Condenser:AirCooled}\label{refrigerationcondenseraircooled}

The refrigeration system requires a single condenser to reject the system heat.~ The air cooled condenser object is one of four options for this condenser. In an air-cooled condenser, the total heat of rejection is characterized by a linear relationship between the difference between the inlet air (usually the outside drybulb) and condensing temperatures. This curve is commonly found in the condenser manufacturers' literature. This rating curve, which corresponds to ARI 460 standards, also has an associated rated value for subcooling that should be entered. The rated condenser fan power and fan speed control type must be specified. If the condenser is not at ground level, the user may specify an air inlet node name (ref: OutdoorAir:Node name). If the condenser is located inside a conditioned zone, the zone name may be specified(ref: bbbZoneNamebbb). Optional input is provided to help the user compare refrigerant inventories for different systems.~ These inputs represent the design values for the refrigerant inventory within the condenser, within a receiver beneath the condenser, and in the liquid pipes between the condenser and the refrigerated cases.

If this field is left blank, the outdoor air drybulb temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank and an outdoor air node name is entered, this node name must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If a zone name is entered, the temperature of that zone is used.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-4-001}

This field allows the specification of a user-defined end-use subcategory (e.g., ``Low Temperature Rack''). A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (Ref: Output:Meter objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is left blank, the equipment will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Refrigerant Operating Charge Inventory}\label{field-condenser-refrigerant-operating-charge-inventory}

\subsection{Refrigeration:Condenser:EvaporativeCooled}\label{refrigerationcondenserevaporativecooled}

Each refrigeration system requires a single condenser.~ The evaporative cooled condenser object is one of four options for this condenser. In an evaporative-cooled condenser, the total heat of rejection is characterized by a four-factor relationship between the condensing temperature and the difference between the outside wetbulb and condensing temperatures. This curve must be developed by regression from the condenser manufacturers' literature. This rating curve, which is based upon rated data taken according to ARI 460 standards, also has an associated rated value for subcooling that should be entered. The rated condenser fan power and fan speed control type must be specified. If the condenser is not at ground level, the user may specify an air inlet node name (ref: OutdoorAir:Node name). Optional input is provided to help the user compare refrigerant inventories for different systems.~ These input represent the design values for the refrigerant inventory within the condenser, within a receiver beneath the condenser, and in the liquid pipes between the condenser and the refrigerated cases.

Additional inputs are needed for basin heater parameters, water pump power, and water source. An evaporative cooling availability schedule is available.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-9-016}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-10-013}

Identifies a particular condenser that rejects heat for a one or more refrigeration system(s). The name must be unique and will be validated against all the condenser names (ref: Refrigeration:Condenser:*) in the input file, including names used for air-cooled, water-cooled and cascade-cooled condensers.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Effective Total Heat Rejection Rate}\label{field-rated-effective-total-heat-rejection-rate}

This numeric field should be the rated heat rejection effect (W) at standard rating conditions per ARI 490.~ Be sure the rating corresponds to the correct refrigerant.

This numeric field specifies the rated subcooling (DeltaC) specified by the manufacturer, consistent with the rated value for total heat rejection.

\paragraph{Field: Fan Speed Control Type}\label{field-fan-speed-control-type}

The type of fan speed control used by the condenser fan. Valid choices are \textbf{Fixed}, \textbf{FixedLinear}, \textbf{VariableSpeed}, and \textbf{TwoSpeed}.~ If the field is blank, \textbf{Fixed} will be used. See the Engineering Reference for a discussion of this option's effect on fan energy consumption.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Fan Power}\label{field-rated-fan-power-1-000}

This numeric field specifies the rated fan power (W) specified by the manufacturer, under standard rating conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Fan Air Flow Ratio}\label{field-minimum-fan-air-flow-ratio-1}

\paragraph{Field: Approach Temperature Coefficient 3}\label{field-approach-temperature-coefficient-3}

As described in the Engineering Reference (ref Refrigeration:Condenser:Evaporative), the heat rejection capacity factor is specified according to the form (where Twetbulb and Tcondense are in C):

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Capacity Factor}\label{field-maximum-capacity-factor}

This numeric field is the maximum heat rejection capacity factor in the manufacturer's data used to develop the equation described in the preceding four fields. The default value is 5.0.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name-005}

This optional alpha field contains the name of the node from which the condenser draws its outdoor air. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air drybulb temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, this node name must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-rated-air-flow-rate-000}

The air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\)per second, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water evaporated when evaporatively cooling the condenser inlet air. The value for this field must be greater than zero. This input field is also autocalculatable, equivalent to 0.000144 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of total cooling capacity {[}850 cfm/ton{]} where the total cooling capacity is the total heat of rejection.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-1-002}

This field defines the power level of the basin heater, if applicable, used to avoid water freezing in an outdoor evaporative cooler basin. This numeric field contains the capacity of the electric basin heater in Watts per degree C. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Set Point Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the dry-bulb temperature of the condenser coil inlet air. The basin heater only operates when the condenser fan is off (i.e., no compressor heat rejection). The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of 200 W/C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-1-002}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (°C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this set point temperature, as long as the condenser fan is off. The default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Water Pump Power}\label{field-rated-water-pump-power}

The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The value for this field must be greater than or equal to 0, with a default value of 1000 Watts if this field is left blank. This input field is also autocalculatable, equivalent to 0.004266 W per Watt {[}15 W/ton{]} of total cooling capacity.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Water Supply Tank Name}\label{field-evaporative-water-supply-tank-name-1}

This field is used to define where the condenser obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If this field is left blank, the unit will obtain water directly from the mains (Ref. Water Mains Temperatures). If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the unit will obtain its water from that tank.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-availability-schedule-name-1}

For evaporative cooled condensers, the name of the optional schedule (Ref: Schedule) that specifies the time periods that evaporative cooling is available/unavailable. In some colder climates, evaporative cooling is periodically discontinued and the basin sumps drained to avoid freezing and to avoid ice formation on the condenser. In these times, the condenser runs as a typical dry air cooled condenser, and related evaporative cooling systems (e.g., water pump, basin heaters) do not operate. Use of this optional schedule permits modeling of planned, seasonal interruptions of evaporative cooling. All schedule values must be greater than or equal to zero. Typically, an ON/OFF schedule type is used with values being either 0 or 1. A schedule value of 1 indicates that evaporative cooling is available during the defined time period, and a value of 0 denotes that evaporative cooling is not available during the defined time period. If the schedule name is omitted (blank), then the model assumes that evaporative cooling of the condenser is available for the entire simulation period. Note: the use of this schedule is the correct way to model an evaporative condenser in a climate subject to freezing weather.~ However, because some users will take a single model description and run it for a multiple climates, the code also includes an automatic switch from wet to dry operation, as described in the Engineering Reference.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-5-000}

This field allows the specification of a user-defined end-use subcategory (e.g., ``Low Temperature Rack''). A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (Ref: Output:Meter objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is left blank, the equipment will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Refrigerant Operating Charge Inventory}\label{field-condenser-refrigerant-operating-charge-inventory-1}

This numeric field specifies the amount of refrigerant present within the condenser (kg) specified by the manufacturer, under standard rating conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Condensate Receiver Refrigerant Inventory}\label{field-condensate-receiver-refrigerant-inventory-1}

This numeric field specifies the amount of refrigerant present within the condensate receiver (kg) specified by the manufacturer or system designer, under standard rating conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Condensate Piping Refrigerant Inventory}\label{field-condensate-piping-refrigerant-inventory-1}

This numeric field specifies the amount of refrigerant present within the condensate piping (kg) specified by the system designer, under standard rating conditions.

\subsection{Refrigeration:Condenser:Cascade}\label{refrigerationcondensercascade}

The refrigeration system requires a single condenser.~ The cascade condenser object is one of four options for this condenser. The cascade condenser is unlike the other condenser options because it rejects heat to another, higher-temperature, refrigeration system. That is, the cascade condenser acts as a heat rejection object for one system, but acts as a refrigeration load for another system.~ Therefore, this object will be referenced twice: first for the system rejecting heat (see the field Refrigeration Condenser Name for the object Refrigeration:System), and second for the system absorbing the heat (see the input for the field Refrigeration Transfer Load or TransferLoad List Name for the object Refrigeration:System or the field Cascade Condenser Name or Secondary System Name for the object Refrigeration:TransferLoadList).

Manufacturer's data is required for the rated condensing temperature and the rated approach temperature difference. The user must also specify the condensing temperature control type.~ There are two choices. The user can specify ``Fixed'' and the condensing temperature will be held constant at the input value.~ The user can specify ``Float'' if they want the condensing temperature to be set by other refrigeration loads served by the higher-temperature system.

The rated heat rejection capacity is not used except as a rough input value check on the overall system sizing. Optional input is provided to help the user compare refrigerant inventories for different systems.~ These inputs represent the design values for the refrigerant inventory within the condenser, within a receiver beneath the condenser, and in the liquid pipes between the condenser and the refrigerated cases.

\subsection{Refrigeration:TransferLoadList}\label{refrigerationtransferloadlist}

A refrigeration system may provide cooling to other, secondary, systems through either a secondary loop or a cascade condenser (Ref. Refrigeration:SecondarySystem and Refrigeration:Condenser:Cascade). If multiple transfer loads are served by a single primary system, use this list to group them together for reference by the primary system (see the field ``Refrigeration Transfer Load or TransferLoad List Name'' in the Refrigeration:System object).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-13-011}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-14-007}

A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a refrigeration transfer load list. Any reference to this list by another object will use this name. In particular, the primary refrigeration system absorbing the heat from all the loads listed here will use this name to reference those loads.

\paragraph{Field: Cascade Condenser Name or Secondary System Name}\label{field-cascade-condenser-name-or-secondary-system-name}

Identifies a cascade condenser or secondary loop that is cooled, along with the other transfer loads listed here, by a single system. The name will be validated against the Refrigeration:SecondarySystem and Refrigeration:Condenser:Cascade names in the input file (the name will also be compared against all the other condenser names, but an error will be issued if it refers to any type of condenser other than a cascade condenser).

The list is extensible; ten fields are provided in the IDD.

The following is an example input for a transfer load list.

\begin{lstlisting}

Refrigeration:TransferLoadList,
      MedTempTransferLoads ,   !- Name
      CascadeCondFrozen,       !- Cascade Condenser Name or Secondary System Name
      SecondLoopDairy;         !- Cascade Condenser Name or Secondary System Name
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Refrigeration:SecondarySystem}\label{refrigerationsecondarysystem}

A refrigeration secondary system works in conjunction with refrigerated cases and walkins (Ref. Refrigeration:SecondarySystem, Refrigeration:CaseAndWalkInList, Refrigeration:Case, and Refrigeration:WalkIn) to simulate the performance of a secondary loop supermarket refrigeration system. Heat from the refrigeration loads served by the secondary loop is absorbed by a primary refrigeration system (ref: Refrigeration:System). The SecondarySystem object simulates a heat exchanger that is an evaporator, or refrigeration load, on the primary refrigeration system.

The inputs for the refrigeration secondary system object include a name, which is also referenced to identify the load placed upon the primary refrigeration system. The inputs that describe the loads placed upon the secondary loop include the name of a single refrigerated case, the name of a single walk-in cooler, or a list of cases and walkin coolers.~ The circulating fluid type specifies whether or not the secondary fluid remains in the liquid state throughout the loop (e.g., a glycol or brine solution) or undergoes a partial phase change while serving the refrigeration loads (e.g., a CO\(_{2}\) liquid overfeed system). The circulating fluid name must also be specified and must correspond to a name used to provide the fluid properties.

If the secondary fluid remains a liquid, the heat exchanger between the primary and secondary systems functions as an evaporator on the primary side and chills the circulating fluid on the secondary side. Inputs that describe the evaporator performance at rated conditions are used to calculate the heat exchanger effectiveness. These values include the rated evaporator capacity (which can be specified in terms of energy or fluid flow rate), the rated evaporating temperature, the rated approach temperature difference, and the rated range temperature difference.

If the secondary fluid undergoes a partial phase change, the heat exchanger between the primary and secondary systems functions as an evaporator on the primary side and as a condenser on the secondary side. The evaporator capacity, evaporating temperature, and approach temperature difference, all at full-load design conditions, are input.

The balance of the secondary system object describes the pumping system. The pumping options include a single constant speed pump, multiple constant speed pumps, or a variable frequency-drive pump.~ The user can also keep track of distribution piping and receiver shell heat gains.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-14-011}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-15-007}

\paragraph{Field: Circulating Fluid Name}\label{field-circulating-fluid-name}

The name of the secondary circulating fluid.

For ``FluidAlwaysLiquid'', this name must correspond to either an ethylene or propylene glycol (ref: FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration) or to a user-defined glycol (ref: FluidProperties:Name and FluidProperties: GlycolConcentration) in the input file. Note that the corresponding property data, including FluidProperties:Concentration, FluidProperties:Temperatures, and FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration must also be included in the input file and are provided in GlycolPropertiesRefData.idf for typical ethylene and propylene glycols.

For ``FluidPhaseChange'', the refrigerant used by the secondary system must be listed in the FluidProperties:Name object.~ The corresponding property data must also be supplied in the input file. Property data for many refrigererants, including R11, R123, R134A, R12, R22, R404A, R507A, R410A, and R744, are available in FluidPropertiesRefData.idf.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporator Capacity}\label{field-evaporator-capacity}

For ``FluidAlwaysLiquid'', this numeric field should be the rated heat evaporator capacity (W).~ Be sure the rating corresponds to the correct refrigerant and secondary circulating fluid. If this variable is specified and the rated evaporator flow rate for secondary fluid is not, then the flow rate will be calculated.~ At least one of these two input variables is required.

For ``FluidPhaseChange'', this numeric field should be the evaporator capacity (W) at full-load design conditions. If this input is left blank, the capacity will be set to the sum of the capacities of the cases and walk-ins served by the secondary loop plus the pump motor load at full-load design conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporator Flow Rate for Secondary Fluid}\label{field-evaporator-flow-rate-for-secondary-fluid}

For ``FluidAlwaysLiquid'' systems, this is the rated evaporator secondary fluid flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s.~ If this variable is specified and the rated evaporator capacity in watts is not, then the rated capacity will be calculated. At least one of these two input variables is required.

For ``FluidPhaseChange'', this field is not used (see ``Phase Cange Circulating Rate'').

\paragraph{Field:Evaporator Evaporating Temperature}\label{fieldevaporator-evaporating-temperature}

\paragraph{Field: Evaporator ~Range Temperature Difference}\label{field-evaporator-range-temperature-difference}

For ``FluidAlwaysLiquid'', this numeric field is the rated temperature difference (DeltaC) between the circulating secondary fluid entering and leaving the heat exchanger. This value is not used for ``FluidPhaseChange''.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Pumps in Loop}\label{field-number-of-pumps-in-loop}

\paragraph{Field: Total Pump Flow Rate}\label{field-total-pump-flow-rate}

This is the secondary fluid circulating flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s at full-load design conditions.~ For ``FluidAlwaysLiquid'', if no value is input, the Evaporator Flow Rate for Secondary Fluid will be used. For ``FluidPhaseChange'', if no value is input, the flow rate will be calculated using the Evaporator Capacity and the PhaseChange Circulating Rate.

\paragraph{Field: Total Pump Power}\label{field-total-pump-power}

This numeric field should be the pump power (W) at full-load design conditions.~ Be sure the rating corresponds to the correct secondary circulating fluid at the design fluid temperature. EITHER the Total Pump Power OR the Total Pump Head is required.

\paragraph{Field: Total Pump Head}\label{field-total-pump-head}

This numeric field should be the design pressure drop, or head, across the secondary loop (Pa) at full load design conditions.~ Be sure the rating corresponds to the correct secondary circulating fluid at the design fluid temperature. EITHER the Total Pump Power OR the Total Head is required.

\paragraph{Field: PhaseChange Circulating Rate}\label{field-phasechange-circulating-rate}

This field is not used for ``FluidAlwaysLiquid''.

For ``FluidPhaseChange'', the Circulating Rate is defined as the total mass flow at the pump divided by the mass flow rate of vapor returning to the separator. Values between 2.1 and 3 are common for CO\(_{2}\) systems and the default is 2.5. If Total Pump Flow Rate is also defined, the PhaseChange Circulating Rate will only be used to check whether the two values are consistent.

\paragraph{Field: Pump Drive Type}\label{field-pump-drive-type}

Specifies whether the pump(s) is constant speed or variable speed.~ The options are ``Constant'' and ``Variable''. The default is ``Constant''.

\paragraph{Field: Variable Speed Pump Cubic Curve Name}\label{field-variable-speed-pump-cubic-curve-name}

The name of a \textbf{cubic} performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the variable speed pump power (and the associated load on the secondary refrigeration load) at off-rated conditions. The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at full-load design conditions. The variable speed pump cubic curve name is used only for the a pump drive type of ``Variable''.

\paragraph{Field: Pump Motor Heat to Fluid}\label{field-pump-motor-heat-to-fluid}

This choice field determines how much of the pump motor heat will be added to the circulating secondary fluid. This represents the motor efficiency for a non-hermetic motor. The default is 0.85.~ For a semi-hermetic motor, enter 1.0. The value entered must be between 0.5 and 1.0.

This optional field is used when trying to determine the impact of pipe heat gains on system performance, particularly in comparing a DX system to a secondary system. (If the previous field, Sum UA Distribution Piping, is blank, this field will not be used.) Enter the name of the zone where the Distribution piping is located. The distribution piping heat gains will be calculated based upon the air temperature within this zone and will count as a cooling credit for this zone.

\paragraph{Field: Sum UA Receiver/Separator Shell}\label{field-sum-ua-receiverseparator-shell}

This optional field is typically used when trying to compare the impact of refrigeration component heat gains on system performance, particularly in comparing a conventional primary DX system to a secondary system.

\paragraph{Field: Receiver/Separator Zone Name}\label{field-receiverseparator-zone-name}

This optional field is used when trying to determine the impact of refrigeration component heat gains on system performance, particularly in comparing a conventional primary DX system to a secondary system. (If the previous field, Sum UA Receiver/Separator, is blank, this field will not be used.) Enter the name of the zone where the receiver/separator is located. The heat gains will be calculated based upon the air temperature within this zone and will count as a cooling credit for this zone.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporator Refrigerant Inventory}\label{field-evaporator-refrigerant-inventory}

The secondary loop is chilled by a primary system via a heat exchanger.~ This field is the refrigerant inventory on the cold (primary) side of that heat exchanger, in kg. The default value is zero.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-8}

This field allows the specification of a user-defined end-use subcategory (e.g., ``Low Temperature Rack''). A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (Ref: Output:Meter objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is left blank, the equipment will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

\subsection{Refrigeration:AirChiller}\label{refrigerationairchiller}

The Refrigeration:AirChiller object works in conjunction with a refrigeration chiller set, compressor rack, a refrigeration system, or a refrigeration secondary system object (Ref. ZoneHvac:RefrigerationChillerSet, and a Refrigeration:CompressorRack, Refrigeration:System, or Refrigeration:SecondarySystem) to simulate the performance of an air chiller, similar to one found in a refrigerated warehouse. The air chiller model uses information at rated conditions along with the zone conditions to determine performance. Energy use for fans and heaters is modeled based on inputs for nominal power, schedules, and control type. The refrigeration chiller model accounts for the sensible and latent heat exchange with the surrounding environment.

The refrigeration chiller cooler object inputs include a name, an availability schedule name, the rated cooling capacity, the rated operating temperature, the rated cooling source temperature, the rated total heating power and heating power schedule, the rated fan power and schedules, defrost type, defrost control type, defrost schedule name, drip-down schedule name, defrost power, the portion of the defrost energy used to melt ice (only for temperature termination control type), and refrigerant inventory.

Chiller coils are rated under multiple conventions. Each rating is typically based upon a selected fin material and refrigerant cycle, with correction factors for other materials or refrigerants. Fields are provided here for those correction factors. The performance of all chiller coils depends upon the inlet air temperature, relative humidity, and flow rate. Multiple methods of expressing this relationship are provided here to accommodate the way information is provided by different manufacturers.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-15-011}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-16-007}

A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a refrigeration chiller. Any reference to this refrigeration chiller by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-2-007}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the refrigeration chiller can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (maximum schedule value of 1.0 is typically used) indicates that the refrigeration chiller will operate during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the case does not operate (everything is OFF: refrigeration, fans, lights, anti-sweat, etc.). Typically the refrigeration chiller will operate throughout the day (i.e., the schedule will contain 1 for all time periods); however, refrigeration chillers require maintenance and/or cleaning and this can be modeled accordingly using this schedule if desired. If this field is left blank, the default schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Capacity Rating Type}\label{field-capacity-rating-type}

The type of capacity rating used for this refrigeration chiller. Valid choices are UnitLoadFactorSensibleOnly, CapacityTotalSpecificConditions, EuropeanSC1Standard, EuropeanSC1NominalWet, EuropeanSC2Standard, EuropeanSC2NominalWet, EuropeanSC3Standard, EuropeanSC3NominalWet, EuropeanSC4Standard, EuropeanSC4NominalWet, EuropeanSC5Standard, and EuropeanSC5NominalWet. In each case, select the rating option that corresponds to the expected service conditions.~ For example, U.S. manufacturers quote a separate Unit Load Factor for wet or frosted coils.~ If the evaporating temperature is less than 0C, input the frosted coil value. Within the European convention, select SC1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 depending upon the expected evaporating temperature. This field is required and there is no default value. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on these rating types. NOTE: If the CapacityTotalSpecificConditions rating type is specified, the input file must include the manufacturer's coil capacity correction curve in tabular form using the Table:MultiVariableLookup object. An example of this may be found in the RefrigeratedWarehouse.idf example file.

\paragraph{NOTE -- ONLY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO FIELDS IS USED}\label{note-only-one-of-the-following-two-fields-is-used}

\paragraph{Field: Rated Unit Load Factor}\label{field-rated-unit-load-factor}

The sensible cooling capacity in watts (W/C) at rated conditions. The value entered for this field must be greater than zero, with no default value. This value is only used if the Capacity Rating Type is UnitLoadFactorSensibleOnly. The value given must be based upon the difference between the chiller inlet and outlet air temperatures, not on the difference between the zone mean temperature and the outlet air temperature.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Capacity}\label{field-rated-capacity-001}

The cooling capacity in watts (W) at rated conditions. The value entered for this field must be greater than zero, with no default value. This field is only used if the Capacity Rating Type is CapacityTotalSpecificConditions, EuropeanSC1Standard, EuropeanSC1NominalWet, EuropeanSC2Standard, EuropeanSC2NominalWet, EuropeanSC3Standard, EuropeanSC3NominalWet, EuropeanSC4Standard, EuropeanSC4NominalWet, EuropeanSC5Standard, or EuropeanSC5NominalWet. For CapacityTotalSpecificConditions, this capacity includes both sensible and latent at the conditions given in the next two fields.~ Note that the European Standard ratings are sensible only and the European Nominal ratings include latent capacity as well. The value given here must correspond to the capacity rating type given previously.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Relative Humidity}\label{field-rated-relative-humidity}

This field is ONLY used if the Capacity Rating Type is CapacityTotalSpecificConditions and represents the relative humidity at rated conditions, expressed as a percent. The default is 85.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Cooling Source Temperature}\label{field-rated-cooling-source-temperature-1}

For a DX evaporator coil, enter the saturated evaporating temperature in ˚C.~ For a fluid coil, enter the fluid coil entrance temperature in ˚C. There is no default value. This number is used, with temperatures for other refrigeration loads on any one system, to set that system's minimum suction pressure or minimum circulating fluid temperature.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Temperature Difference DT1}\label{field-rated-temperature-difference-dt1}

The rated difference between the air entering the refrigeration chiller and the cooling source temperature in ˚C. The entered value for this field must be less than 20˚C. There is no default value.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Difference Between Inlet Air and Evaporating Temperature}\label{field-maximum-difference-between-inlet-air-and-evaporating-temperature}

The maximum difference between the air entering the refrigeration chiller and the cooling source temperature in °C used to limit capacity during pull-down. The default is 1.3 times the Rated Temperature Difference DT1.

\paragraph{Field: Coil~ Material Correction Factor}\label{field-coil-material-correction-factor}

This field is used to enter the manufacturer's correction factor for coil material corresponding to the rating previously input. The default is 1.0 (dimensionless).

\paragraph{Field: Refrigerant Correction Factor}\label{field-refrigerant-correction-factor}

This field is used to enter the manufacturer's correction factor for refrigerant corresponding to the rating previously input. The default is 1.0 (dimensionless). (Note, the refrigerant itself is specified for the detailed system or secondary loop providing the refrigerant to this coil.)

\paragraph{Field: Capacity Correction Curve Type}\label{field-capacity-correction-curve-type}

The type of capacity correction curve used to account for the impact of the room air conditions on the chiller capacity. Valid choices are LinearSHR60, QuadraticSHR, European, and TabularRHxDT1xTRoom. This field will default to LinearSHR60, unless the CapacityTotalSpecificConditions rating type is specified, in which case, the TabularRHxDT1xTRoom correction curve type must be used. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on these curve types. The resulting correction factor for LinearSHR60, QuadraticSHR, and European types will be applied to the sensible capacity and must have output values between 1 and 2. The resulting correction factor for TabularRHxDT1xTRoom will be applied to the CapacityTotalSpecificConditions capacity and can have values between 0.2 and 2. If TabularRHxDT1xTRoom is used, the curve type within the table must be specified as ``Quadratic''.

\paragraph{Field: Capacity Correction Curve Name}\label{field-capacity-correction-curve-name}

The name of the curve object defining the total refrigerating capacity. For correction curve types LinearSHR60 and QuadraticSHR, the independent variable is the Sensible Heat Ratio and the output values are between 1.0 and 2.0. For correction curve type European, EnergyPlus contains built-in capacity correction curves and specification of a capacity correction curve name is not required. For correction curve type TabularRHxDT1xTRoom, enter the name of a Table:MultiVariableLookup object that gives the total capacity (in W) as a function of RH, DT1, and Room Temperature; IN THAT ORDER. An example of a TabularRHxDT1xTRoom correction curve using the Table:MultiVariableLoopkup object may be found in the RefrigeratedWarehouse.idf example file.

\paragraph{Field: SHR60 Correction Factor}\label{field-shr60-correction-factor}

This field is only used when the capacity correction curve type is LinearSHR60. It should correspond to the capacity factor, that is, the total capacity divided by the sensible capacity corresponding to a Sensible Heat Ratio of 0.6. The default is 1.48 (dimensionless).

\paragraph{Field: Rated Total Heating Power}\label{field-rated-total-heating-power-1}

The total heating power in watts including drip-pan and any other heaters (W). This value is required and has no default value.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Power Schedule Name}\label{field-heating-power-schedule-name-1}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes the fraction of heater power that operates during a given time period. A schedule value of zero denotes that all heaters are off. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that some portion of the total heater power will operate during that time period (maximum schedule value of 1.0 means all heaters are fully on). If this field is left blank, the default schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Fan Speed Control Type}\label{field-fan-speed-control-type-1}

The type of fan speed control used by the cooling coil's fan(s). Valid choices are \textbf{Fixed}, \textbf{FixedLinear}, \textbf{VariableSpeed}, and \textbf{TwoSpeed}.~ If the field is blank, \textbf{Fixed} will be used. See the Engineering Reference for a discussion of this option's effect on fan energy consumption.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Fan Power}\label{field-rated-fan-power-3}

The cooling coil fan power in watts (W). This value has a default value of 375W. This fan is assumed to run continuously except during electric, hot brine, or hot gas defrost periods.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Air Flow}\label{field-rated-air-flow}

The cooling coil fan rated air flow in cubic meters per second (m\(^{3}\)/s). This value has no default value and must be input.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Fan Air Flow Ratio}\label{field-minimum-fan-air-flow-ratio-3}

The minimum fraction of the rated air flow for part-load fan operation, must be between 0. and 1.0. The default value is 0.2.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Type}\label{field-defrost-type-1}

The type of defrost used for this refrigeration chiller. Valid choices are None, Off-Cycle, HotFluid, and Electric. The default defrost type is Electric if the field is blank. HotFluid includes both hot gas and hot brine defrost systems. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the different defrost types are modeled.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Control Type}\label{field-defrost-control-type-1}

The type of defrost control used for this refrigeration chiller. Valid choices are TimeSchedule and TemperatureTermination. The default is TimeSchedule if the field is blank. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the different defrost controls are modeled.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Schedule Name}\label{field-defrost-schedule-name-1}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes when the refrigeration chiller requires defrosting. A schedule value of 1.0 indicates that defrost can be on during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the defrost is off. Defrost schedules normally repeat the duration and number of defrost cycles for each day of the year. The refrigeration chiller manufacturer typically provides this information with the product literature. If TemperatureTermination control type is used, the defrost schedule is used for the defrost cycle start time and the defrost cycle end time is not allowed to extend beyond the scheduled off time. The use of Compact Schedules (ref. Schedules) are ideal for this purpose.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Drip-Down Schedule Name}\label{field-defrost-drip-down-schedule-name-1}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the refrigeration chiller requires additional time for draining condensate after the defrost period. A schedule value of 1.0 indicates that the defrost drip-down period is on during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the defrost drip-down period is over. The refrigeration chiller manufacturer typically provides this information with the product literature.

Each defrost drip-down period specified in this schedule should start at the same time as the corresponding defrost period specified in the schedule for Defrost Schedule, and the drip-down schedule defrost period should always be longer than or equal to the length of the defrost schedule time period. For example, if the defrost schedule contains a defrost period from 7:00 to 7:15, you would specify a case defrost drip-down period from 7:00 to 7:20 if you wanted to model a 5 minute condensate drip-down period after the regular defrost period. If no drip-down schedule is entered, then the defrost schedule (specified for the previous input field) will be used. The use of Compact Schedules (ref. Schedules) are ideal for this purpose.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Power}\label{field-defrost-power-1}

The defrost power in watts. This input is required for hot-fluid (hot gas or hot brine), or electric defrost types. Refrigeration chiller manufacturers do not typically provide information on the heat input for hot gas and hot brine defrost. Information provided for electric defrost power can be substituted here for refrigeration chillers using hot-gas or hot-brine defrost if other information is not available. Only electric Defrost Types consume electricity during the defrost period. The entered value for this field must be greater than or equal to zero.

\paragraph{Field: Temperature Termination Defrost Fraction to Ice}\label{field-temperature-termination-defrost-fraction-to-ice-1}

When cooling coils go through a defrost cycle, only a portion of the defrost energy is actually used to melt the ice.~ The rest of the defrost energy goes to increasing the temperature of the coils themselves and to the refrigeration chiller environment. The Temperature Termination defrost control type calculates the end of the defrost cycle that corresponds to melting all the ice. Therefore, the user must input this fractional value. The default value is 0.7 for electric defrost and 0.3 for hot fluid defrost. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the defrost energy control types are modeled.

\paragraph{Field: Vertical Location}\label{field-vertical-location}

The vertical location for this refrigeration chiller. Valid choices are Floor, Middle, and Ceiling. The default is Middle if the field is blank. The vertical location is used to transform the mixed zone air temperature to the coil inlet air temperature. Refer to the Engineering Reference for further information on how the different vertical locations are modeled.

\paragraph{Field: Average Refrigerant Charge Inventory}\label{field-average-refrigerant-charge-inventory-2}

The value of this optional field is the refrigerant inventory present in the refrigeration chiller during ordinary operation. The value is used to produce an estimate of the total refrigerant present in the refrigeration system. The value is entered in kg.

The following is an example input for a refrigeration air chiller.
