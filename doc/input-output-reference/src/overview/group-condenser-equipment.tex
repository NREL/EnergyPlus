\subsection{Equipment Types}\label{equipment-types}

In each CondenserEquipmentList, various equipment types and names must be given. Each type-name pair must then have a corresponding equipment definition. This subsection lists the various equipment types that are available and examples from an IDF. Where appropriate, notes and comments on the input structure are provided.

\subsection{CoolingTower:SingleSpeed}\label{coolingtowersinglespeed}

Cooling towers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a single-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel's theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for ``free convection'', they must specify the corresponding airflow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'', if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is below the set point, the tower will operate in FluidBypass mode -- portion of the water goes through the tower media and gets cooled while the remaining water flow gets bypassed, two water flows then mix together trying to meet the water setpoint temperature. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan on for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the tower cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.

Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~WaterUse:Storage objects).

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;
\item
  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity
\item
  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-007}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-006}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.

\paragraph{Field: Water Inlet Node Name}\label{field-water-inlet-node-name}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Water Outlet Node Name}\label{field-water-outlet-node-name}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Design Water Flow Rate}\label{field-design-water-flow-rate}

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m\(^{3}\)/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower (not the flow rate of water being sprayed on the outside of the heat exchange coil). If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically assumes a water flow rate of 5.382E-8 m3/s per watt (3 gpm/ton) of tower capacity specified in the field ``Nominal Capacity''.

\paragraph{Field: Design Air Flow Rate}\label{field-design-air-flow-rate}

This numeric field contains the design air flow rate induced by the tower fan in m\(^{3}\)/s. A value greater than zero must be defined regardless of the tower performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. If autosized, the design air flow rate is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
Design\;Air\;Flow\;Rate = \frac{{0.5{\rho_{air}}(Fan\;power\;at\;Design\;Air\;Flow\;Rate)}}{{190.}}
\end{equation}

where a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals and total fan efficiency of 0.5 are assumed.

\textbf{\emph{Field: Design Fan Power}}

This numeric field contains the fan power (in watts) at the design air flow rate specified in the previous field. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of the tower performance input method, or this field can be autosized. If autosized, the fan power is calculated as follows:

If``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``\emph{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'', then

\begin{equation}
Fan\;power = 0.0105\cdot {\rho_{water}}\cdot {C_{p,water}}\cdot Design\;Water\;Flow\;Rate\cdot Design\;Loop\Delta T
\end{equation}

is used.

If``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``\emph{NominalCapacity}'', then

\begin{equation}
Fan\;power = 0.0105\cdot Tower\;Nominal\;Capacity
\end{equation}

is used.

\paragraph{Field: Design U-Factor Times Area Value}\label{field-design-u-factor-times-area-value}

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design tower UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), assuming a tower water inlet temperature of 35C and tower inlet air at 35C drybulb/25.6C wetbulb. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field ``Nominal Capacity''.

\paragraph{Field:Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate}\label{fieldfree-convection-regime-air-flow-rate}

This numeric field contains the air flow rate (m\(^{3}\)/s) when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field ``Design Air Flow Rate''. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``Design Air Flow Rate'' determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'' and is using the Performance Input Method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies the U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate or Free Convection Capacity as a value greater than zero, then the free convection air flow rate must be specified greater than 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate Sizing Factor}\label{field-free-convection-regime-air-flow-rate-sizing-factor}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime air flow rate.~ The default is 0.1.

\paragraph{Field:Free Convection Regine U-Factor Times Area Value}\label{fieldfree-convection-regine-u-factor-times-area-value}

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (W/K) when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate''. This field may be autosized, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate'' determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'' and is using the~ Performance Input Method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field ``Free Convection Capacity''.\textbackslash{}

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor}\label{field-free-convection-u-factor-times-area-value-sizing-factor}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime U-Factor times area value.~ The default is 0.1.

\paragraph{Field: Performance Input Method}\label{field-performance-input-method}

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: ``\textbf{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'' or ``\textbf{NominalCapacity}''. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be ``\textbf{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}''. If the method ``\textbf{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'' is selected, then the user must enter design UA values, design water flow rates and air flow rates as described for the previous input fields. If the method ``NominalCapacity'' is selected then the fields ``Design Water Flow Rate'', ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate'' and ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate'' must be left blank, but the fields ``Nominal Capacity'' and ``Free Convection Capacity'' must be entered as described below.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio}\label{field-heat-rejection-capacity-and-nominal-capacity-sizing-ratio}

This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.~ This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.~ The default is 1.25.

\paragraph{Field: Nominal Capacity}\label{field-nominal-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The value in the previous field times this nominal tower capacity gives the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions (based on historical assumption that the tower must dissipate additional heat from the compressor heat for heat removed at the evaporator).

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Capacity}\label{field-free-convection-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off), with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of nominal tower capacity (input field above). The heat rejection capacity and nominal capacity sizing ratio is applied tof this free convection tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions (typical value is 1.25 based on historical assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25W of compressor heat for every watt of heat removed by the evaporator). The value specified for this field must be less than the value specified for the field ``Tower Nominal Capacity''. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies a value greater than zero, then the ``Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime'' field must contain a value greater than zero. This field can be automatically calculated using the sizing factor in the following field.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity Sizing Factor}\label{field-free-convection-nominal-capacity-sizing-factor}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Free Convection Capacity. The default is 0.1.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity}

This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Mode}\label{field-evaporation-loss-mode}

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: \textbf{LossFactor} or \textbf{SaturatedExit}. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Factor}\label{field-evaporation-loss-factor}

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air {[}percent/K{]}. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to \textbf{LossFactor}. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 {[}percent/K{]}. The default is 0.2.

\paragraph{Field: Drift Loss Percent}\label{field-drift-loss-percent}

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets {[}\%{]}. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Typical values for towers with efficient drift eliminators are between 0.002 and 0.2\% of the condenser water flow rate. The default value is 0.008\%.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode}\label{field-blowdown-calculation-mode}

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options \textbf{ConcentrationRatio} or \textbf{ScheduledRate}. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio}\label{field-blowdown-concentration-ratio}

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name}\label{field-blowdown-makeup-water-usage-schedule-name}

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m\(^{3}\)/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m\(^{3}\)/s (17.3 to 112.3 m\(^{3}\)/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-outdoor-air-inlet-node-name-000}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field:Capacity Control}\label{fieldcapacity-control}

This alpha field contains the cooling capacity control for the cooling tower. Two choices are available: \textbf{FanCycling} and \textbf{FluidBypass}. During part-load conditions, there are two ways to maintain the exiting water temperature at the setpoint: either cycling the tower fan, or bypassing portion of the tower water with a three-way valve. For FluidBypass, the tower fan still runs at full speed for the entire timestep, but only portion of the water flow goes through the cooling tower media to get cooled while the remaining portion of the water flow gets bypassed. Two water flows then mix at the common water sump to meet the setpoint temperature.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Cells}\label{field-number-of-cells}

This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower

\paragraph{Field: Cell Control}\label{field-cell-control}

This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:

\textbf{MinimalCell} : the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the \emph{Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.}

\textbf{MaximalCell}: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the \emph{Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}.

\paragraph{Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}\label{field-cell-minimum-water-flow-rate-fraction}

This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.

\paragraph{Field: Cell Maximum~ Water Flow Rate Fraction}\label{field-cell-maximum-water-flow-rate-fraction}

This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.

\paragraph{Field: Sizing Factor}\label{sizing-factor-01}

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.~~~~Design Water Flow Rate;

2.~~~~Design Air Flow Rate;

3.~~~~Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

4.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate;

5.~~~~Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime;

6.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate.

Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate is not \emph{multiplied} by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design tower load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate is set to 10\% of the new design Tower UA.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{end-use-subcategory-01}

This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: Output:Meter objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the cooling tower will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

\subsection{CoolingTower:TwoSpeed}\label{coolingtowertwospeed}

The two-speed cooling tower is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed tower. The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a two-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel's theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the airflow rate and corresponding fan power at both high and low fan speed must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for ``free convection'', they must specify the corresponding air flow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'', if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature. If operating the tower fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the tower fan is increased to its high speed.

The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a WaterUse:Storage object.

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;
\item
  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity
\item
  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{Field: Name}}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-006}

\paragraph{Field: Water Inlet Node Name}\label{field-water-inlet-node-name-1}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Water Outlet Node Name}\label{field-water-outlet-node-name-1}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Design Water Flow Rate}\label{field-design-water-flow-rate-1}

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m\(^{3}\)/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower (not the flow rate of water being sprayed on the outside of the heat exchange coil). If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically assumes a design water flow rate of 5.382E-8 m3/s per watt (3 gpm/ton) of tower capacity specified in the field ``Tower High-Speed Nominal Capacity''.

\paragraph{Field: High Fan Speed Air Flow Rate}\label{field-high-fan-speed-air-flow-rate}

This numeric field contains the tower air flow rate at high fan speed in m\(^{3}\)/s. A value greater than zero must be defined regardless of the tower performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. If autosized, the design air flow rate is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
Air\,Flow\,Rate\,at\,High\,Fan\,Speed\, = \,\frac{{0.5{\rho_{air}}(Fan\,Power\,at\,High\,Fan\,Speed\,)}}{{190.}}
\end{equation}

where a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals and total fan efficiency of 0.5 are assumed.

\textbf{\emph{Field: High Fan Speed Fan Power}}

This numeric field contains the fan power (in Watts) at the high-speed air flow rate specified in the previous field. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of the tower performance input method, or this field can be autosized. If autosized, the fan power is calculated as follows:

If``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``\emph{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'', then

\begin{equation}
Fan\;powe{r_{High\;Fan\;Speed}} = 0.0105\cdot {\rho_{water}}\cdot {C_{p,water}}\cdot Design\;Water\;Flow\;Rate\cdot Design\;Loop\Delta T
\end{equation}

is used.

If``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``\emph{NominalCapacity}'', then

\begin{equation}
Fan\;powe{r_{High\;Fan\;Speed}} = 0.0105\cdot Tower\;High - Speed\;Nominal\;Capacity
\end{equation}

is used.

\paragraph{Field: High Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Value}\label{field-high-fan-speed-u-factor-times-area-value}

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per degree Celsius corresponding to the high-speed air flow rate and design water flow rate specified above. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the tower UA value at high fan speed is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), assuming a tower water inlet temperature of 35C and tower inlet air at 35C drybulb/25.6C wetbulb. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the capacity specified in the field ``High-Speed Nominal Capacity''.

\paragraph{Field: Low Fan Speed Air Flow Rate}\label{field-low-fan-speed-air-flow-rate}

This numeric field contains the tower air flow rate at low fan speed in m\(^{3}\)/s. This value must be greater than zero, less than the value specified for the field ``Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed'', and greater than the value specified for the field ``Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime''. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed'' determined in the next field.

This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed'' determined in the following field. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field ``Low Speed Nominal Capacity''.

\paragraph{Field: Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor}\label{field-low-fan-speed-u-factor-times-area-sizing-factor}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the low speed heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA).~ The default is 0.6.

This numeric field contains the air flow rate (m\(^{3}\)/s) when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field ``Air Flow Rate at Low Fan Speed''. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed'' determined in the following field. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'' and is using the Performance Input Method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies the U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate or Free Convection Capacity as a value greater than zero, then the free convection air flow rate must be specified greater than 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Air Flow Rate Sizing Factor}\label{field-free-convection-air-flow-rate-sizing-factor}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime air flow rate.~ The default is 0.1.

\paragraph{Field: Free ConvectionU-Factor Times Area Value}\label{field-free-convectionu-factor-times-area-value}

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (W/°C) when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed''. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed'' determined in the following field. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'' and is using the Performance Input Method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field ``Free Convection Capacity''.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor}\label{field-free-convection-u-factor-times-area-value-sizing-factor-1}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime U-Factor times area value.~ The default is 0.1.

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'' or ``NominalCapacity''. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate''. If the method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'' is selected, then the user must enter UA values, design water flow rate and air flow rates as described for the previous input fields. If the method ``NominalCapacity'' is selected then the fields ``Design Water Flow Rate'', ``U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed'', ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed'' and ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate'' must be left blank, but the fields ``High Speed Nominal Capacity'', ``Low Speed Nominal Capacity'' and ``Free Convection Capacity'' must be entered as described below.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio}\label{field-heat-rejection-capacity-and-nominal-capacity-sizing-ratio-1}

This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.~ This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.~ The default is 1.25.

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Nominal Capacity}\label{field-high-speed-nominal-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts under high-speed fan operation, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of high-speed nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio set in the previous field is applied to this nominal tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating.

\paragraph{Field: Low Speed Nominal Capacity}\label{field-low-speed-nominal-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts under low-speed fan operation, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of high-speed nominal tower capacity (input field above). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this nominal tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.

The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of high-speed nominal tower capacity (input field above). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this free convection tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.The value specified for this field must be less than the value specified for the field ``Tower Low-Speed Nominal Capacity''. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'', then this field should be set to 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-1}

This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-1}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name-1}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Mode}\label{field-evaporation-loss-mode-1}

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: `LossFactor' or `SaturatedExit'. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Factor}\label{field-evaporation-loss-factor-1}

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air {[}percent/K{]}. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 {[}percent/K{]}. The default is 0.2.

\paragraph{Field: Drift Loss Percent}\label{field-drift-loss-percent-1}

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets {[}\%{]}. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Typical values for towers with efficient drift eliminators are between 0.002 and 0.2\% of the condenser water flow rate. The default value is 0.008\%.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode}\label{field-blowdown-calculation-mode-1}

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options ConcentrationRatio or ScheduledRate. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio}\label{field-blowdown-concentration-ratio-1}

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name}\label{field-blowdown-makeup-water-usage-schedule-name-1}

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m\(^{3}\)/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m\(^{3}\)/s (17.3 to 112.3 m\(^{3}\)/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-1}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-outdoor-air-inlet-node-name-1}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Cells}\label{field-number-of-cells-1}

This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower

\paragraph{Field: Cell Control}\label{field-cell-control-1}

This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:

\textbf{MinimalCell}: the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the \emph{Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.}

\textbf{MaximalCell}: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the \emph{Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}.

\paragraph{Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}\label{field-cell-minimum-water-flow-rate-fraction-1}

This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.

\paragraph{Field: Cell Maximum~ Water Flow Rate Fraction}\label{field-cell-maximum-water-flow-rate-fraction-1}

This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.

\paragraph{Field: Sizing Factor}\label{field-sizing-factor}

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.~~~~Design Water Flow Rate;

2.~~~~Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed;

3.~~~~Fan Power at High Fan Speed;

4.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed;

5.~~~~Air Flow Rate at Low Fan Speed;

6.~~~~Fan Power at Low Fan Speed;

7.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed;

8.~~~~Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime;

9.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate.

Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed is not \emph{multiplied} by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design tower load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed is set to a fraction of the full load design UA determined by the field Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate is set to a fraction of the design Tower UA determined by the field Free Convection Air U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{end-use-subcategory-02}

This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: Output:Meter objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the cooling tower will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

Four examples of an IDF specification for this object are shown below:

\subsection{CoolingTower:VariableSpeed:Merkel}\label{coolingtowervariablespeedmerkel}

This variable speed tower model is based on Merkel's theory and is similar to the single-speed and two-speed tower models.~ The open wet cooling tower is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with a variable-speed fan drawing air through the tower (induced-draft configuration). The model also includes a ``free convection'' regime where cooling tower performance modeled with the fan off.

For this model, Merkel's theory is modified to include adjustments developed by Scheier to alter the heat transfer effectiveness based on current wetbulb, air flow rates, and water flow rates. The input requires performance curves or lookup tables to describe these three adjustment factors.

For a multi-cell tower, the capacity and air/water flow rate inputs are for the entire tower.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-006}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-005}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.

\paragraph{Field: Water Inlet Node Name}\label{field-water-inlet-node-name-2}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Water Outlet Node Name}\label{field-water-outlet-node-name-2}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Performance Input Method}\label{field-performance-input-method-2}

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: ``\textbf{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'' or ``\textbf{NominalCapacity}''. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be ``\textbf{NominalCapacity}''. If the method ``'' is selected, then the user must enter design UA values, design water flow rates and air flow rates as described for the previous input fields. If the method ``NominalCapacity'' is selected then the fields ``Design Water Flow Rate'', ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate'' and ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate'' must be left blank, but the fields ``Nominal Capacity'' and ``Free Convection Capacity'' must be entered as described below.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio}\label{field-heat-rejection-capacity-and-nominal-capacity-sizing-ratio-2}

This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.~ This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.~ The default is 1.25.

\paragraph{Field: Nominal Capacity}\label{field-nominal-capacity-1}

This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts under full-speed fan operation, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio set in the previous field is applied to this nominal tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.~ This field can be autosized, in which case a Sizing:Plant object is needed for the condenser loop.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity}\label{field-free-convection-nominal-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off), with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this free convection tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.The value specified for this field must be less than the value specified for the field ``Tower Low-Speed Nominal Capacity''. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies a value greater than zero, then the ``Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime'' field must contain a value greater than zero. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the High Speed Nominal Capacity determined in the following field.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity Sizing Factor}\label{field-free-convection-nominal-capacity-sizing-factor-2}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Free Convection Capacity. The default is 0.1.

\paragraph{Field: Design Water Flow Rate}\label{field-design-water-flow-rate-2}

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m\(^{3}\)/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Sizing:Plant object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field can be autocalculated using the sizing factor in the following field.

\paragraph{Field: Design Water Flow Rate per Unit of Nominal Capacity}\label{field-design-water-flow-rate-per-unit-of-nominal-capacity}

This numeric field contains a scalable sizing factor for design water flow rate that scales with nominal capacity, in units of m\(^{3}\)/s/W. The default value is 5.382*10\(^{-8}\). This field is only used if the previous field is set to autocalculate and performance input method is NominalCapacity.~ (If the performance input method is set to UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate then the design water flow rate is obtained from the plant sizing result.)

\paragraph{Field: Design Air Flow Rate}\label{field-design-air-flow-rate-1}

This numeric field contains the tower air flow rate at full fan speed, in m\(^{3}\)/s.~ The value can be autocalculated, in which case the air flow rate is based off of the scalable sizing factor in the following input field.

\paragraph{Field: Design Air Flow Rate Per Unit of Nominal Capacity}\label{field-design-air-flow-rate-per-unit-of-nominal-capacity}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the design air flow rate from the nominal capacity, in units of m\(^{3}\)/s/W.~ The default is 2.76316*10\(^{-5}\).~ When this field is left blank, then the default value is used but the flow rate is also scaled to account for elevation (with larger volume flow rates at higher altitudes).~ When a hard value is entered, even if it is the same as the default, then the design air flow rate is not also adjusted for elevation and the scaling factor is used directly.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Air Flow Rate Ratio}\label{field-minimum-air-flow-rate-ratio}

This numeric field contains the minimum air flow rate ratio. The tower fan is allowed to operate between the ratio defined here and a maximum air flow rate ratio of 1.0 (which corresponds to the design {[}maximum{]} tower air flow rate). Below this value the tower is assumed to operate in the ``free convection'' regime with the tower fan off. The minimum air flow rate ratio must be greater than or equal to 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.5, with a default value of 0.2 if the field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Design Fan Power}\label{field-design-fan-power}

This numeric field contains the fan power in watts at the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autocalculated. When the field is autocalculated the following input field is used to size the fan power based on nominal capacity.

\paragraph{Field: Design Fan Power Per Unit of Nominal Capacity}\label{field-design-fan-power-per-unit-of-nominal-capacity}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the design fan power from the nominal capacity, in units of Watts per Watt. This field is only used if the previous is set to autocalculate. The default values is 0.0105.

\paragraph{Field: Fan Power Modifier Function of Air Flow Rate Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-fan-power-modifier-function-of-air-flow-rate-ratio-curve-name}

This alpha field contains the name of a curve or table object that describes fan power ratio (fan power/design fan power) as a function of air flow rate ratio (air flow rate/design air flow rate). The curve or table object must be for one independent variable, typically a cubic, and should be normalized to 1.0 at an air flow rate ratio of 1.0.~ This field is required.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate}\label{field-free-convection-regime-air-flow-rate-1}

This numeric field contains the air flow rate (m\(^{3}\)/s) when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field ``Design Air Flow Rate''. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``Design Air Flow Rate'' determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'' and is using the Performance Input Method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies the U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate or Free Convection Capacity as a value greater than zero, then the free convection air flow rate must be specified greater than 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate Sizing Factor}\label{field-free-convection-regime-air-flow-rate-sizing-factor-1}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime air flow rate.~ The default is 0.1.

\paragraph{Field: Design Air Flow Rate U-Factor Times Area Value}\label{field-design-air-flow-rate-u-factor-times-area-value}

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design tower UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), assuming a tower water inlet temperature of 35C and tower inlet air at 35C drybulb/25.6C wetbulb. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field ``Nominal Capacity''.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection Regime U-Factor Times Area Value}\label{field-free-convection-regime-u-factor-times-area-value}

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (W/K) when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate''. This field may be autosized, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate'' determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'' and is using the~ Performance Input Method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field ``Free Convection Capacity''.

\paragraph{Field: Free Convection U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor}\label{field-free-convection-u-factor-times-area-value-sizing-factor-2}

This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime U-Factor times area value.~ The default is 0.1. This field is only used if the previous field is set to autocalculate and the performance input method is UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate.

\paragraph{Field: U-Factor Times Area Modifier Function of Air Flow Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-u-factor-times-area-modifier-function-of-air-flow-ratio-curve-name}

This alpha field contains the name of a curve or table object that describes how the UA value varies as a function of air flow rate ratio (air flow rate/design air flow rate).~ The result of this curve is multiplied by the design UA value to adjust for air flow rate, along with the two other modifiers discussed below.~ The curve or table object must be for one independent variable and should be normalized to 1.0 at an air flow rate ratio of 1.0.~ This field is required.

\paragraph{Field: U-Factor Times Area Modifier Function of Wetbulb Temperature Difference Curve Name}\label{field-u-factor-times-area-modifier-function-of-wetbulb-temperature-difference-curve-name}

This alpha field contains the name of a curve or table object that describes how the UA value varies as a function of the current wetbulb temperature.~ The result of this curve is multiplied by the design UA value to adjust for wetbulb temperatures that differ from design conditions at 25.56°C (78°F), along with the two other modifiers discussed in the previous and following fields.~ The independe variable is the design wetbulb minus the current outdoor air wetbulb, in units of degrees Celsius.~ The curve or table object must be for one independent variable and should be normalized to 1.0 at a wetbulb temperature difference of 0.0.~ This field is required.

\paragraph{Field: U-Factor Times Area Modifier Function of Water Flow Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-u-factor-times-area-modifier-function-of-water-flow-ratio-curve-name}

This alpha field contains the name of a curve or table object that describes how the UA value varies as a function of the current water flow rate ratio (water flow rate/design water flow rate). The result of this curve is multiplied by the design UA value to adjust for water flow rates that differ from design level, along with the other two modifiers discussed above. The curve or table object must be for one independent variable and should be normalized to 1.0 at a water flow ratio of 1.0.~ This field is required

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-2}

This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-2}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name-2}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Mode}\label{field-evaporation-loss-mode-2}

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: \textbf{LossFactor} or \textbf{SaturatedExit}. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Factor}\label{field-evaporation-loss-factor-2}

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air {[}percent/K{]}. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to \textbf{LossFactor}. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 {[}percent/K{]}. The default is 0.2.

\paragraph{Field: Drift Loss Percent}\label{field-drift-loss-percent-2}

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets {[}\%{]}. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Typical values for towers with efficient drift eliminators are between 0.002 and 0.2\% of the condenser water flow rate. The default value is 0.008\%.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode}\label{field-blowdown-calculation-mode-2}

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options \textbf{ConcentrationRatio} or \textbf{ScheduledRate}. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio}\label{field-blowdown-concentration-ratio-2}

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name}\label{field-blowdown-makeup-water-usage-schedule-name-2}

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m\(^{3}\)/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m\(^{3}\)/s (17.3 to 112.3 m\(^{3}\)/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-2}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-outdoor-air-inlet-node-name-2}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Cells}\label{field-number-of-cells-2}

This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower

\paragraph{Field: Cell Control}\label{field-cell-control-2}

This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:

\textbf{MinimalCell} : the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the \emph{Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.}

\textbf{MaximalCell}: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the \emph{Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}.

\paragraph{Field: Cell Minimum~ Water Flow Rate Fraction}\label{field-cell-minimum-water-flow-rate-fraction-2}

This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.

\paragraph{Field: Cell Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction}\label{field-cell-maximum-water-flow-rate-fraction-2}

This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.

\paragraph{Field: Sizing Factor}\label{field-sizing-factor-1}

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{end-use-subcategory-03}

This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: Output:Meter objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the cooling tower will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

\subsection{CoolingTower:VariableSpeed}\label{coolingtowervariablespeed}

The variable speed tower model is based on empirical curve fits of manufacturer's performance data or field measurements. The user specifies tower performance at design conditions, and empirical curves are used to determine the approach temperature and fan power at off-design conditions. The user defines tower performance by entering the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, tower range, and tower approach temperature at the design conditions. The corresponding water flow rate (within ±25\% of the tower's rated water mass flow rate), air flow rate, and fan power must also be specified. The model will account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). Basin heater operation and makeup water usage (due to evaporation, drift, and blowdown) are also modeled.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'' on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the variable-speed tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature is above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the variable-speed tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature. Tower fan power is calculated based on the tower air flow rate required to achieve the exiting water set point temperature.

Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a WaterUse:Storage object.

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;
\item
  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity
\item
  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)
\end{itemize}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the variable speed cooling tower.

\paragraph{Field: Water Inlet Node Name}\label{field-water-inlet-node-name-3}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Water Outlet Node Name}\label{field-water-outlet-node-name-3}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Model Type}\label{field-model-type}

This alpha field contains the type of empirical model used to simulate the tower's thermal performance (approach temperature). Valid choices for this field are ``CoolToolsCrossFlow'', ``CoolToolsUserDefined'', ``YorkCalc'', or ``YorkCalcUserDefined''. ``CoolToolsCrossFlow'' and ``YorkCalc'' are empirical models with the equation form and model coefficients already defined within EnergyPlus. If ``CoolToolsUserDefined'' or ``YorkCalcUserDefined'' is selected, the user must specify a valid Model Coefficient Name in the next input field to reference an appropriate CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools or CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc object. If a user-defined model type is selected and the specified Model Coefficient Name is not found in the input data file (idf), then a severe message is issued and the simulation will terminate.

\paragraph{Field: Model Coefficient Name}\label{field-model-coefficient-name}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the object(s) CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools or CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc. A single model coefficient object may be used to define coefficients for multiple variable speed cooling tower objects (i.e., the same name may be used in this input field for more than one variable speed tower). This field is only used when the field Tower Model Type described above is set to ``CoolToolsUserDefined'' or ``YorkCalcUserDefined'', and should be left blank otherwise.

\paragraph{Field: Design Inlet Air Wet-Bulb Temperature}\label{field-design-inlet-air-wet-bulb-temperature}

This numeric field specifies the inlet air wet-bulb temperature (˚C) at design conditions. This design temperature should correspond with the design values for range temperature, approach temperature, water flow rate, and air flow rate specified in the following fields. The minimum value for this field is 20˚C and the default value is 25.6˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Design Approach Temperature}\label{field-design-approach-temperature}

This numeric field specifies the tower approach temperature (˚C) at design conditions. The approach temperature is the outlet water temperature minus the inlet air wet-bulb temperature. The design approach temperature should correspond with the design values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, water flow rate, and air flow rate specified for this tower. The value for this field must be greater than 0˚C and the default value is 3.9˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Design Range Temperature}\label{field-design-range-temperature}

This numeric field specifies the range temperature (˚C) at design conditions. The range temperature is defined as the inlet water temperature minus the outlet water temperature. The design range temperature should correspond with the design values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, approach temperature, water flow rate, and air flow rate specified for this tower. The value for this field must be greater than 0˚C and the default value is 5.6˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Design Water Flow Rate}\label{field-design-water-flow-rate-3}

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m\(^{3}\)/s. The value entered should be within ±25\% of the tower's rated water mass flow rate as specified by the manufacturer if Model Type is ``CoolToolsCrossFlow'' or ``YorkCalc''. This constraint may be different for Model Type ``CoolToolsUserDefined'' or ``YorkCalcUserDefined'' (ref. CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools or CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc).

This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. A Plant Sizing object must be defined if the field is autosized and the design water flow rate is then derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). The design water flow rate should correspond with the design values specified for the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, approach temperature, range temperature, and air flow rate. When this field is not autosized, the condenser loop flow rate specified in other objects should be within ±25\% of the tower's rated water flow rate (different range is permissible if Model Type is ``User Defined'').

\paragraph{Field: Design Air Flow Rate}\label{field-design-air-flow-rate-2}

This numeric field contains the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower in m\(^{3}\)/s. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. Autosizing of this field does not require a Plant Sizing object since the design air flow rate is assumed to be the design fan power multiplied by a total fan efficiency of 0.5 and divided by a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals. A correction for altitude is also included as follows:

\begin{equation}
Design\;Air\;Flow\;Rate = \frac{{0.5(Fan\;power\;at\;Design\;Air\;Flow\;Rate)}}{{190.}}\left( {\frac{{101325.}}{{{P_{atm}}}}} \right)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Field: Design Fan Power}\label{field-design-fan-power-1}

This numeric field contains the fan power in watts at the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the fan power is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
Design\,fan\;power = 0.0105\cdot {\rho_{water}}\cdot {C_{p,water}}\cdot Design\;Water\;Flow\;Rate\cdot Design\;Loop\Delta T
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Field: Fan Power Ratio Function of Air Flow Rate Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-fan-power-ratio-function-of-air-flow-rate-ratio-curve-name}

This alpha field contains the curve object name for fan power ratio (fan power/design fan power) as a function of air flow rate ratio (air flow rate/design air flow rate) {[}ref. Performance Curves{]}. The curve object must be a cubic curve and should be normalized to 1.0 at an air flow rate ratio of 1.0. If this field is left blank, a theoretical fan curve is assumed where fan power ratio is directly proportional to the air flow rate ratio cubed.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Air Flow Rate Ratio}\label{field-minimum-air-flow-rate-ratio-1}

This numeric field contains the minimum air flow rate ratio. The tower fan is allowed to operate between the ratio defined here and a maximum air flow rate ratio of 1.0 (which corresponds to the design {[}maximum{]} tower air flow rate). Below this value, the tower is assumed to operate either in the ``free convection'' regime with the tower fan off, or the tower fan is cycled on/off to maintain the exiting water set point temperature. The minimum air flow rate ratio must be greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than or equal to 0.5, with a default value of 0.2 if the field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction of Tower Capacity in Free Convection Regime}\label{field-fraction-of-tower-capacity-in-free-convection-regime}

This numeric field contains the fraction of tower capacity available in the free convection regime (i.e., when the tower fan is off but water continues to flow through the tower). The tower fan does not operate when the free convection tower capacity is able to meet or exceed the exiting water set point temperature. The air flow rate through the tower in the free convection regime is assumed to be this same fraction of the tower design air flow rate. The fraction of tower capacity in free convection regime must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0.2, with a default value of 0.125 if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-3}

This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-3}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name-3}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Mode}\label{field-evaporation-loss-mode-3}

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: `LossFactor' or `SaturatedExit'. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Factor}\label{field-evaporation-loss-factor-3}

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air {[}percent/K{]}. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 {[}percent/K{]}. The default is 0.2.

\paragraph{Field: Drift Loss Percent}\label{field-drift-loss-percent-3}

This numeric field contains the percent (\%) of design water flow rate lost to the atmosphere at the design air flow rate due to drift, which is water droplets that are entrained in the airstream as it passes through the tower. Drift is assumed to vary directly with tower air flow rate ratio, and is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or blowdown. Typical values for water usage due to drift are from 0.05 to 0.2\% of the total water circulation rate with currently-available drift eliminators from tower manufacturers. The value entered in this field must be greater than or equal to zero, and the default is zero if the field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode}\label{field-blowdown-calculation-mode-3}

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options `ConcentrationRatio' or `ScheduledRate'. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio}\label{field-blowdown-concentration-ratio-3}

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name}\label{field-blowdown-makeup-water-usage-schedule-name-3}

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m\(^{3}\)/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the condenser loop of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m\(^{3}\)/s (17.3 to 112.3 m\(^{3}\)/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-3}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUser:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-outdoor-air-inlet-node-name-3}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Cells}\label{field-number-of-cells-3}

This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower

\paragraph{Field: Cell Control}\label{field-cell-control-3}

This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:

\textbf{MinimalCell}: the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the \emph{Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.}

\textbf{MaximalCel} : As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the \emph{Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}.

\paragraph{Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}\label{field-cell-minimum-water-flow-rate-fraction-3}

This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.

\paragraph{Field: Cell Maximum~ Water Flow Rate Fraction}\label{field-cell-maximum-water-flow-rate-fraction-3}

This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.

\paragraph{Field: Sizing Factor}\label{field-sizing-factor-2}

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.~~~~Design Water Flow Rate;

2.~~~~Design Air Flow Rate;

3.~~~~Design Fan Power.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{end-use-subcategory-05}

This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: Output:Meter objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the cooling tower will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

These outputs are the electric power input to the tower fan. Consumption is metered on HeatRejection:Electricity, Electricity:Plant, and Electricity:Facility.

\paragraph{Cooling Tower Fan Part Load Ratio {[]}}\label{cooling-tower-fan-part-load-ratio}

This is the on/off cycling rate of the tower fan when free convection cannot meet the set point temperature and the tower capacity at the minimum air flow rate ratio drives the tower exiting water temperature below the set point temperature. The fan part-load ratio is calculated as the ratio of the exiting water temperature in the free convection regime minus the exiting water temperature set point divided by the exiting water temperature in the free convection regime minus the exiting water temperature at the minimum air flow rate ratio.

During times when the fan cycles on/off to maintain the outlet water set point temperature, the air flow rate ratio is calculated as the summation of Fan Part-Load Ratio multiplied by the Minimum Air Flow Rate Ratio and (1.0 - Fan Part-Load Ratio) multiplied by the fraction of Tower Capacity in Free Convection Regime.

\subsection{CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools}\label{coolingtowerperformancecooltools}

Variable speed cooling towers can be modeled by EnergyPlus with user-selectable performance based on the CoolTools correlation, YorkCalc correlation, or user-defined coefficients for either the CoolTools or YorkCalc correlations.The empirical CoolTools tower correlation uses a set of 35 coefficients to model the thermal performance (approach temperature) of a cooling tower based on four independent variables. If the user specifies Model Type = CoolToolsCrossFlow in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object, then the 35 coefficients derived for the CoolTools simulation model are used and these coefficients are already defined within EnergyPlus. If the user specifies Model Type = CoolToolsUserDefined, then the user must enter a CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools object to define the 35 coefficients that will be used by the CoolTools correlation.

The user must specify a name for the model coefficient object, and this name must be used in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object (field Model Coefficient Name) to tell the program to use these coefficients. Next, the user enters the minimum and maximum values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, approach temperature, and water mass flow rate ratio to specify the valid range for which the model coefficients were derived. For all of these variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range specified. For approach and range, the warnings are issued if the values are beyond the specified minimum/maximum range but the actual values are still used.

The CoolTools correlation has four independent variables: inlet air wet-bulb temperature (Twb), tower range temperature (Tr), water flow rate ratio (FRwater), and air flow rate ratio (FRair). Temperatures are in units of ˚C and flow rate ratios are dimensionless (actual flow rate divided by design flow rate). Using these independent variables, tower approach temperature (˚C) is calculated as follows:

Approach = ~~ Coeff(1)~ +~ Coeff(2)•FRair~ +~ Coeff(3)•(FRair)\(^{2}\)~ +

Coeff(4)•(FRair)\(^{3}\)~ +~ Coeff(5)•FRwater~ +

Coeff(6)•FRair•FRwater~ +~ Coeff(7)•(FRair)\(^{2}\)•FRwater~ +

Coeff(8)•(FRwater)\(^{2}\)~ +~ Coeff(9)•FRair•(FRwater)\(^{2}\)~ +

Coeff(10)•(FRwater)\(^{3}\)~ +~ Coeff(11)•Twb~ +~ Coeff(12)•FRair•Twb~ +

Coeff(19)•FRwater•(Twb)\(^{2}\)~ +~ Coeff(20)•(Twb)\(^{3}\)~ +~ Coeff(21)•Tr~ +

Coeff(22)•FRair•Tr~ +~ Coeff(23)•FRair•FRair•Tr~ +

Coeff(24)•FRwater•Tr~ +~ Coeff(25)•FRair•FRwater•Tr~ +

Coeff(26)•(FRwater)\(^{2}\)•Tr~ +~ Coeff(27)•Twb•Tr~ +

Coeff(28)•FRair•Twb•Tr~ +~ Coeff(29)•FRwater•Twb•Tr~ +

Coeff(30)•(Twb)\(^{2}\)•Tr~ +~ Coeff(31)•(Tr)\(^{2}\) + Coeff(32)•FRair•(Tr)\(^{2}\) +

Coeff(33)•FRwater•(Tr)\(^{2}\) +~ Coeff(34)•Twb•(Tr)\(^{2}\) +~ Coeff(35)•(Tr)\(^{3}\)

This object allows the user to specify model coefficients for use with the CoolTools correlation shown above. It is recommended that a broad set of cooling tower performance data be used to generate these model coefficients. The data set used to create the model coefficients should cover the entire range of water and air flow rate ratios and inlet air wet-bulb, range, and approach temperatures expected during the simulation.

\subsection{CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc}\label{coolingtowerperformanceyorkcalc}

Variable speed cooling towers can be modeled by EnergyPlus with user-selectable performance based on the CoolTools correlation, YorkCalc correlation, or user-defined coefficients for either the CoolTools or YorkCalc correlations.The empirical YorkCalc tower correlation uses a set of 27 coefficients to model the thermal performance (approach temperature) of a variable speed cooling tower based on three independent variables. If the user specifies Tower Model Type = YorkCalc in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object, then the 27 coefficients derived for the YorkCalc simulation model are used and these coefficients are already defined within EnergyPlus. If the user specifies Tower Model Type = YorkCalcUserDefined, then the user must enter a CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc object to define the 27 coefficients that will be used by the YorkCalc correlation.

The user must specify a name for the model coefficient object, and this name must be used in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object (field Model Coefficient Name) to tell the program to use these coefficients. Next, the user enters the minimum and maximum values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, approach temperature, and water mass flow rate ratio to specify the valid range for which the model coefficients were derived. The user also specifies the maximum valid liquid-to-gas ratio. For all of these variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range specified. For approach, range, and liquid-to-gas ratio the warnings are issued if the values are beyond the specified minimum/maximum range but the actual values are still used.

The YorkCalc correlation has three independent variables: inlet air wet-bulb temperature (Twb), tower range temperature (Tr), and the liquid-to-gas ratio (ratio of water flow rate ratio to air flow rate ratio = LGRatio). Temperatures are in units of ˚C and liquid-to-gas ratio is dimensionless. Using these independent variables, an approach temperature (˚C) is calculated as follows:

~~~ Approach = ~~~~~ Coeff(1)~ +~ Coeff(2)•Twb~ +~ Coeff(3)•Twb\(^{2}\) +~ Coeff(4)•Tr~ +

Coeff(5)•Twb•Tr~ +~ Coeff(6)•Twb\(^{2}\)•Tr~ +~ Coeff(7)•Tr\(^{2}\)~ +

Coeff(8)•Twb•Tr\(^{2}\) +~ Coeff(9)•Twb\(^{2}\)•Tr\(^{2}\) + Coeff(10)•LGRatio~ +

Coeff(11)•Twb•LGRatio~ +~ Coeff(12)•Twb\(^{2}\)•LGRatio~ +

Coeff(13)•Tr•LGRatio~ +~ Coeff(14)•Twb•Tr•LGRatio~ +

Coeff(15)•Twb\(^{2}\)•Tr•LGRatio~ +~ Coeff(16)•Tr\(^{2}\)•LGRatio~ +

Coeff(17)•Twb•Tr\(^{2}\)•LGRatio~ +~ Coeff(18)•Twb\(^{2}\)•Tr\(^{2}\)•LGRatio +

Coeff(19)•LGRatio\(^{2}\) +~ Coeff(20)•Twb•LGRatio\(^{2}\)~ +

Coeff(21)• Twb\(^{2}\)•LGRatio\(^{2}\) +~ Coeff(22)•Tr•LGRatio\(^{2}\) +

Coeff(23)•Twb•Tr•LGRatio\(^{2}\) +~ Coeff(24)•Twb\(^{2}\)•Tr•LGRatio\(^{2}\) +

Coeff(25)•Tr\(^{2}\)•LGRatio\(^{2}\) +~ Coeff(26)•Twb•Tr\(^{2}\)•LGRatio\(^{2}\) +

Coeff(27)•Twb\(^{2}\)•Tr\(^{2}\)•LGRatio\(^{2}\)

This object allows the user to specify model coefficients for use with the YorkCalc correlation shown above. It is recommended that a broad set of cooling tower performance data be used to generate these model coefficients. The data set used to create the model coefficients should cover the entire range of water and air flow rate ratios and inlet air wet-bulb, range, and approach temperatures expected during the simulation.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-5-001}

No additional cooling tower output variables are output when this object is used.

\subsection{EvaporativeFluidCooler:SingleSpeed}\label{evaporativefluidcoolersinglespeed}

Evaporative fluid coolers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The Evaporative fluid cooler is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with single-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of three methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or standard fluid cooler design capacity at a specific rating point or design capacity at non standard conditions. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.

The evaporative fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the evaporative fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan on for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the fluid cooler cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.

Evaporative fluid coolers consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the fluid coolers. For this purpose, the last seven input fields can either be provided in the input or if nothing is specified then the default values for these fields will be used. These fields provide the methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the building's water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~WaterUse:Storage objects). The schematic of the system is shown below:

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-6-004}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-5-005}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the fluid cooler.

\paragraph{Field: Water Inlet Node Name}\label{field-water-inlet-node-name-4}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the fluid cooler's water inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Water Outlet Node Name}\label{field-water-outlet-node-name-4}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the fluid cooler's water outlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Design Air Flow Rate}\label{field-design-air-flow-rate-3}

This numeric field contains the design air flow rate induced by the fluid cooler fan in m\(^{3}\)/s. The field must contain a value greater than zero regardless of the fluid cooler performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. See Engineering Reference document for autosizing calculations.

\paragraph{Field: Design Air Flow Rate Fan Power}\label{field-design-air-flow-rate-fan-power}

This numeric field contains the fan power (in watts) at the design air flow rate specified in the previous field. The field must contain a value greater than zero regardless of the fluid cooler performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. See Engineering Reference document for autosizing calculations.

\paragraph{Field: Design Spray Water Flow Rate}\label{field-design-spray-water-flow-rate}

This numeric field contains the design spray water flow rate through the fluid cooler in m\(^{3}\)/s. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of the performance input method,

\paragraph{Field: Performance Input Method}\label{field-performance-input-method-3}

This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify fluid cooler performance: ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'' or ``StandardDesignCapacity'' or ``UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity''.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-outdoor-air-inlet-node-name-4}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the fluid cooler. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the fluid cooler are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio}\label{field-heat-rejection-capacity-and-nominal-capacity-sizing-ratio-3}

This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.~ This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.~ The default is 1.25.

\paragraph{Field: Standard Design Capacity}\label{field-standard-design-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). 125\% of this capacity gives the actual fluid cooler heat rejection at these operating conditions (based on historical assumption that the evaporative fluid cooler must dissipate 0.25W of compressor heat for every watt of heat removed by the evaporator). This field is only used for performance input method = ''StandardDesignCapacity''. For other input methods this field is ignored. The standard conditions mentioned above for ``standard design capacity'' are already specified in the EnergyPlus. So the input fields such as design entering water temp., design entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temp. and design water flow rate, if provided in the input, will be ignored for the StandardDesignCapacity performance input method. Also, the standard conditions are for water as a fluid type so this performance input method can only be used with water as a fluid type (ref. CondenserLoop object).

\paragraph{Field: Design Air Flow Rate U-factor Times Area Value}\label{field-design-air-flow-rate-u-factor-times-area-value-1}

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design fluid cooler UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), the fluid cooler inlet air dry-bulb and wetbulb temperature are taken from the input. This field is only used for performance input method = '' UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate''. For other performance input methods, this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Design Water Flow Rate}\label{field-design-water-flow-rate-4}

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the fluid cooler in m\(^{3}\)/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the fluid cooler. This field is ignored for the ``StandardDesignCapacity'' performance input method. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections).

\paragraph{Field: User Specified Design Capacity}\label{field-user-specified-design-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts. Design conditions for this capacity i.e.~entering air dry-bulb temperature, entering air wet-bulb temperature and entering water temperature must be provided in the input. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field:Design Entering Water Temperature}\label{fielddesign-entering-water-temperature}

This numeric field contains entering water temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering water temperature must be greater than the design entering air temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field:Design Entering Air Temperature}\label{fielddesign-entering-air-temperature}

This numeric field contains entering air wetbulb temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering air wet-bulb temperature must be less than the design entering air (dry-bulb) temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Capacity Control}\label{field-capacity-control}

This alpha field contains the cooling capacity control for the evaporative fluid cooler. Two choices are available: FanCycling and FluidBypass. During part-load conditions, there are two ways to maintain the exiting water temperature at the setpoint: either cycling the evaporative fluid cooler fan, or bypassing portion of the evaporative fluid cooler water with a three-way valve. For FluidBypass, the evaporative fluid cooler fan still runs at full speed for the entire timestep, but only portion of the water flow goes through the evaporative fluid cooler media to get cooled while the remaining portion of the water flow gets bypassed. Two water flows then mix at the common water sump to meet the setpoint temperature.

\paragraph{Field: Sizing Factor}\label{field-sizing-factor-3}

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.~~ Design Water Flow Rate;

2.~~ Design Air Flow Rate;

3.~~ Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

4.~~ U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate;

Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate is not multiplied by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design evaporative fluid cooler load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Mode}\label{field-evaporation-loss-mode-4}

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the evaporative fluid cooler. There are two options: LossFactor or SaturatedExit. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the evaporative fluid cooler is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the evaporative fluid cooler model (and does not require additional user input).

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Factor}\label{field-evaporation-loss-factor-4}

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the evaporative fluid cooler and lost to the outside air {[}percent/K{]}. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Empirical correlation is used to calculate default loss factor if it not explicitly specified in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Drift Loss Percent}\label{field-drift-loss-percent-4}

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets {[}\%{]}. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode}\label{field-blowdown-calculation-mode-4}

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options ConcentrationRatio or ScheduledRate. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio}\label{field-blowdown-concentration-ratio-4}

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the evaporative fluid cooler as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the evaporative fluid cooler in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name}\label{field-blowdown-makeup-water-usage-schedule-name-4}

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m3/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the evaporative fluid cooler of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the evaporative fluid cooler is active and water is flowing through the evaporative fluid cooler (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-4}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the evaporative fluid cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the evaporative fluid cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the evaporative fluid cooler needs, then the evaporative fluid cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).

An IDF specification for this object is shown below:

\subsection{EvaporativeFluidCooler:TwoSpeed}\label{evaporativefluidcoolertwospeed}

The two-speed evaporative fluid cooler is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed evaporative fluid cooler. The evaporative fluid cooler is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with two-speed fan (induced draft configuration. See schematic diagram in EvaporativeFluidCooler:SingleSpeed section). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of the three methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or standard fluid cooler design capacity at a specific rating point or design capacity at non standard conditions. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.

The evaporative fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the evaporative fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If operating the fluid cooler fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the fluid cooler fan is increased to its high speed.

The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

Evaporative fluid coolers consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the evaporative fluid coolers. For this purpose, the last seven input fields can either be provided in the input or if nothing is specified then the default values for these fields will be used. These fields provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~WaterUse:Storage objects).

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-outdoor-air-inlet-node-name-5}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the fluid cooler. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the fluid cooler are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data.

Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.~ The default is 1.25.

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Standard Design Capacity}\label{field-high-speed-standard-design-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio set in the previous field is applied to this capacity to give the actual fluid cooler heat rejection at these operating conditions. This field is only used for performance input method = ''StandardDesignCapacity''. For other input methods this field is ignored. The standard conditions mentioned above for ``standard design capacity'' are already specified in the EnergyPlus. So the input fields such as design entering water temp., design entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temp. and design water flow rate, if provided in the input, will be ignored for the StandardDesignCapacity performance input method. Also, the standard conditions are for water as a fluid type so this performance input method can only be used with water as a fluid type (ref. CondenserLoop object).

\paragraph{Field: Low Speed Standard Design Capacity}\label{field-low-speed-standard-design-capacity}

This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this capacity to give the actual fluid cooler heat rejection at these operating conditions. This field is only used for performance input method = ''StandardDesignCapacity''. For other input methods this field is ignored. The standard conditions mentioned above for ``standard design capacity'' are already specified in the EnergyPlus. So the input fields such as design entering water temp., design entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temp. and design water flow rate, if provided in the input, will be ignored for the StandardDesignCapacity performance input method. Also, the standard conditions are for water as a fluid type so this performance input method can only be used with water as a fluid type (ref. CondenserLoop object). The value specified for this field must be greater than zero but less than the value specified for the field ``High-Speed Standard Design Capacity''. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the High-Speed Standard Design Capacity determined in the following field.

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the high speed design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 2,100,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design fluid cooler UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), the fluid cooler inlet air dry-bulb and wetbulb temperature are taken from the input. This field is only used for performance input method = '' UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate''. For other input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Low Fan Speed U-factor Times Area Value}\label{field-low-fan-speed-u-factor-times-area-value-1}

This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per degree Kelvin corresponding to the low speed design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 and less than the value specified for the field ``U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed'' must be defined. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a factor of the ``U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed'' determined in the following field. This field is only used for performance input method = '' UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate''. For other input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor}\label{field-low-fan-speed-u-factor-times-area-sizing-factor-1}

This field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Value.~ The default is 0.6.

\paragraph{Field: Design Water Flow Rate}\label{field-design-water-flow-rate-5}

This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the fluid cooler in m\(^{3}\)/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the fluid cooler. This field is ignored for the ``StandardDesignCapacity'' performance input method. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections).

\paragraph{Field: High Speed User Specified Design Capacity}\label{field-high-speed-user-specified-design-capacity}

Design conditions for this capacity i.e.~entering air dry-bulb temperature, entering air wet-bulb temperature and entering water temperature must be provided in the input. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Low Speed User Specified Design Capacity}\label{field-low-speed-user-specified-design-capacity}

Design conditions for this capacity i.e.~entering air dry-bulb temperature, entering air wet-bulb temperature and entering water temperature must be provided in the input. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``High Speed User Specified Design Capacity'' determined in the following field.

\paragraph{Field: Low Speed User Specified Design Capacity Sizing Factor}\label{field-low-speed-user-specified-design-capacity-sizing-factor}

Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field:Design Entering Air Temperature}\label{fielddesign-entering-air-temperature-1}

Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field:Design Entering Air Wet-bulb Temperature}\label{fielddesign-entering-air-wet-bulb-temperature-1}

The design entering air wet-bulb temperature must be less than the design entering air (dry-bulb) temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Sizing Factor}\label{field-high-speed-sizing-factor}

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:

1.~~~~Design Water Flow Rate;

2.~~~~Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed;

3.~~~~Fan Power at High Fan Speed;

4.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed;

5.~~~~Air Flow Rate at Low Fan Speed;

6.~~~~Fan Power at Low Fan Speed;

7.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed;

Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed is not multiplied by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design evaporative fluid cooler load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed is set to Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor times the full load design UA.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Mode}\label{field-evaporation-loss-mode-5}

This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the evaporative fluid cooler. There are two options: LossFactor or SaturatedExit. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the evaporative fluid cooler is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the evaporative fluid cooler model (and does not require additional user input).

\paragraph{Field: Evaporation Loss Factor}\label{field-evaporation-loss-factor-5}

This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the evaporative fluid cooler and lost to the outside air {[}percent/K{]}. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Empirical correlation is used to calculate default loss factor if it not explicitly specified in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Drift Loss Percent}\label{field-drift-loss-percent-5}

This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets {[}\%{]}. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode}\label{field-blowdown-calculation-mode-5}

This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options ConcentrationRatio or ScheduledRate. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio}\label{field-blowdown-concentration-ratio-5}

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the evaporative fluid cooler as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the evaporative fluid cooler in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

\paragraph{Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name}\label{field-blowdown-makeup-water-usage-schedule-name-5}

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m3/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the evaporative fluid cooler of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the evaporative fluid cooler is active and water is flowing through the evaporative fluid cooler (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-5}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the evaporative fluid cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the evaporative fluid cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the evaporative fluid cooler needs, then the evaporative fluid cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).

\subsection{FluidCooler:SingleSpeed}\label{fluidcoolersinglespeed}

Fluid coolers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The Fluid cooler is modeled as a cross flow heat exchanger (both streams unmixed) with single-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of the two methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal fluid cooler capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.

The fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan on for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

The two-speed fluid cooler is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed fluid cooler. The fluid cooler is modeled as a cross flow heat exchanger (both stream unmixed) with~ two-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of two methods: heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal fluid cooler capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the airflow rate and corresponding fan power at both high and low fan speed must be specified. The Fluid Cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the Fluid Cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first runs at low speed and calculates the fluid cooler exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``low speed'' is at or below the set point, then the fluid cooler fan runs at this speed or below this speed. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``low speed'' is modeled, then the fluid cooler fan runs at high speed to reduce the exiting water temperature.

The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep,). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

\subsection{GroundHeatExchanger:System}\label{groundheatexchangersystem}

The EnergyPlus ground loop heat exchanger is a condenser component which serves the condenser supply side in addition to the cooling towers and other condensing components. Figure \ref{fig:schematic-of-energyplus-ground-loop-heat} shows the Ground Heat Exchanger in the simulation environment.

The heat exchanger response is defined by a g-function which is a non-dimensional function that is used to calculate the response to square heat pulses of different duration. (This function is not the same as `G-factors' referred to in the ASHRAE Applications Handbook). This continuous function is specified by a series of data pairs (LNTTS\emph{i}, GFNC\emph{i}) where,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  LNTTS\emph{i} is the non-dimensional time: \emph{ln(T/T\(_{s}\))}
\item
  GFNC\emph{i} is the g-function value
\end{itemize}

The g-function is different for each borehole field configuration (i.e.~a 4 $\times$ 4 field has a different response than a 80 $\times$ 80 field). It is also dependent on the ratio of borehole spacing to depth. g-function values, for accurate simulation, have to be computed for each specific heat exchanger design. The GroundHeatExchanger:System object will accept three different types of input in order to define the g-functions necessary for the ground heat exchanger calculations.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use the GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical:Array object to define a rectangular borehole field. EnergyPlus will compute and cache the g-functions for reuse again in future simulations.
    \item Use one or more GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical:Single objects to define a vertical borehole field with the boreholes located arbitrarily. EnergyPlus will compute and cache the g-functions for reuse again in future simulations.
    \item Use a third-party tool, such as GLHEPro, to compute the g-functions and pass them to EnergyPlus using the GroundHeatExchanger:ResponseFactors object.
\end{enumerate}

A small number of reference datasets containing example input data for 1 $\times$ 2, 4 $\times$ 4 and 8 $\times$ 8 configurations and for both standard and thermally enhanced grout are provided as well.

The original g-functions as defined by Eskilson are based on an borehole radius to active length ratio of 0.0005. If the physical ratio is different from this, a correction must be applied. EnergyPlus will apply the correction, based on the reference ratio entered in this field. Therefore, therefore two possible input configurations.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the g-functions have not had a correction applied, then the g-functions are still based on a reference of 0.0005, so use a value of 0.0005 in this field. EnergyPlus will adjust the g-functions internally to create the properly referenced g-function.
\item
  If the correction has already been applied, then the input g-functions are based on a reference to the actual (physical) radius/length ratio, so enter the physical radius/length in this field. Entering the actual value will nullify any internal corrections, which will avoid re-basing the g-function set.
\end{itemize}

The software GLHEPro has been making this ``pre-correction'' to the data sets since version 3.1 of that software, so this input field should match the actual (physical) radius/length ratio.

\paragraph{Field: g-function Ln(t/ts) Value \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-g-function-lntts-value-x}

This numeric field contains the natural log of time/steady state time: \emph{ln(t/t\(_{s}\))}. Field is extensible.

\paragraph{Field: g-function `g' Value \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-g-function-g-value-x}

This numeric field contains the g-function value of the corresponding LNTTS. Field is extensible.

\subsection{GroundHeatExchanger:Slinky}\label{groundheatexchangerslinky}

The GroundHeatExchanger:Slinky use the g-functions to calculate the GHX temperature response, similar to the GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical model, however for this model g-functions are automatically calculated by EnergyPlus without the need of external software or data.

Horizontal slinky-loop ground heat exchangers (GHXs) consist of coiled tubing, with the individual rings spread out along the direction of the trench either horizontally or vertically, as shown in \protect\hyperlink{SlinkyIOFig1}{Figure}. A schematic of a slinky GHX can be seen in \protect\hyperlink{SlinkyIOFig2}{Figure}. Compared to conventional straight tube horizontal GHXs, slinky loops have a higher tube density; hence, with the same cooling/heating loads, slinky-loop GHXs require less land area and excavation work than straight tube HGHXs.

\subsection{HeatExchanger:FluidToFluid}\label{heatexchangerfluidtofluid}

A fluid-to-fluid heat exchanger designed to couple the supply side of one plant or condenser loop to the demand side of another plant or condenser loop.
This heat exchanger is fairly general and can be configured for use in any application where any two loops need to be connected together.
The only constraints are that that one side must be connected to the supply side of one loop and the other side connected to the demand side of a different loop.

Because the heat exchanger is intended to be generic, its two sides are distinguished by the nature of loop side being connected.
One side is called \textbf{Loop Supply Side} to indicate the heat exchanger is situated on the supply side of a loop.
The other side is called \textbf{Loop Demand Side} to indicate it is on the demand side of a loop.
The heat exchanger is intended to act as a supply component for the loop connected to it as the ``Loop Supply Side''
and as a demand component for the loop connected to it as the ``Loop Demand Side.''
From the point of view of the heat exchanger model itself, the Loop Demand Side fluid serves as the source/sink to supply heating/cooling to the fluid in the Loop Supply Side.

This heat exchanger can be used for a wide variety of applications including chilled water, hot water, condenser, ground source, primary-secondary systems, etc.
Heat transfer is calculated and reported using a sign convention from chilled water applications
where \textbf{positive heat transfer indicates energy was extracted from the Loop Supply Side and added to the Loop Demand Side.}

\textbf{Note}: Only hydronic ``plant'' fluids are allowed (excepting Fluid Type "Steam"), no air-side connections are possible with this heat exchanger.

\caption{Plant Fluid-to-Fluid Heat Exchanger \protect \label{fig:plant-fluid-to-fluid-heat-exchanger}}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Various options are available for the heat exchanger model.}
\begin{itemize}
\item
    The heat transfer between the two sides can be modeled using one of seven different models for different types of heat exchangers.
\item
    There are also eleven options for different ways to control the heat exchanger.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            One general type of control is \textbf{OnOff} where the flow through the heat exchanger is either fully on or fully off.
        \item
            Another type of control is \textbf{Modulated} where the flow through the Loop Demand Side is controlled to try and meet a target setpoint or load on the Loop Supply Side.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

As of Version 8.0, \texbf{this object replaces three separate objects that were available prior to version 8.0 of EnergyPlus}.
\begin{itemize}
\item
    The former \textbf{HeatExchanger:Hydronic} object corresponds to a situation where the Loop Demand Side is the demand side of condenser loop,
    the Loop Supply Side is a the supply side of a chilled water loop, the control type is ``CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride'',
    and the remote override component is a chiller.
\item
    The former \textbf{HeatExchanger:WatersideEconomizer} object corresponds to a situation where the Loop Demand Side is the demand side of condenser loop,
    the Loop Supply Side is a the supply side of a chilled water loop, and the control type is ``CoolingDifferentialOnOff.''
\item
    The former \textbf{HeatExchanger:Plate} object corresponds to a situation where the Loop Demand Side is the demand side of a condenser loop,
    the Loop Supply Side is the supply side of a second condenser loop, and the control type is ``UncontrolledOn.''

\paragraph{Field: Heat Exchange Model Type}\label{field-heat-exchange-model-type}

This alpha field identifies the nature of heat exchanger.~ Heat exchanger model type is specified by one of the following four key word choices:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{CrossFlowBothUnMixed}.~ Specifies a single-pass, cross-flow heat exchanger.~ The effectiveness will be calculated using a cross-flow heat exchanger correlation for both streams unmixed.

\paragraph{Field: Control Type}\label{field-control-type}

This field is used to specify how the heat exchanger is to be controlled during operation.~ Different applications for connecting two loops will require different control behavior and different control options are needed depending on the desired behavior.~ There are the following eleven key choice options to choose from:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{UncontrolledOn}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is passively running all the time and always transfers as much heat as possible between the fluid streams.~ However there is one aspect of control in that it will only request flow on the Loop Demand Side when there is non-zero flow into the heat exchanger on the Loop Supply Side.~ This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:Plate object prior to version 8.0.
\item
  \textbf{OperationSchemeModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is controlled by an operation scheme (see objects called PlantEquipmentOperationScheme or CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes).~ When using this control mode the heat exchanger must be listed in PlantEquipmentList or a CondenserEquipmentList and it serves as a supply component.~ The operation scheme will dispatch a load request to the heat exchanger which it will try meet by conditioning the fluid stream connected as the Loop Supply Side.~ If the heat exchanger could exceed the load request, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the load request.
\item
  \textbf{OperationSchemeOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is controlled by an operation scheme (see objects called PlantEquipmentOperationScheme or CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes).~ When using this control mode the heat exchanger must be listed in PlantEquipmentList or a CondenserEquipmentList and it serves as a supply component.~ The operation scheme will dispatch a load request to the heat exchanger which it will use as an on/off signal to decide if the heat exchange should run or not.~ If it runs, it will run at full capacity and may exceed the load request.
\item
  \textbf{HeatingSetpointModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A heating setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoint and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the heating setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run.~ The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. ~If the heat exchanger could overshoot the setpoint, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the setpoint.
\item
  \textbf{HeatingSetpointOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A heating setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the heating setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. ~If it runs, it will run at full capacity and may overshoot the setpoint.
\item
  \textbf{CoolingSetpointModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful cooling to the Loop Supply Side.~ A cooling setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the cooling setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. If the heat exchanger could undershoot the setpoint, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the setpoint.
\item
  \textbf{CoolingSetpointOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful cooling to the Loop Supply Side.~ A cooling setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the cooling setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. If it runs, it will run at full capacity and may undershoot the setpoint.~ This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:WatersideEconomizer object prior to version 8.0.
\item
  \textbf{DualDeadbandSetpointModulated}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide either useful cooling or heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A dual deadband setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the lower setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the high setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate.~ If the heat exchanger could overshoot the lower setpoint, or undershoot the higher setpoint, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the deadband setpoint.
\item
  \textbf{DualDeadbandSetpointOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide either useful cooling or heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A dual deadband setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the lower setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the high setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. If the heat exchanger runs, it will run at full capacity and may overshoot the lower setpoint or undershoot the higher setpoint.
\item
  \textbf{CoolingDifferentialOnOff}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful cooling to the Loop Supply Side.~ This mode is similar to CoolingSetpointOnOff except that it ignores any cooling setpoint and its control is based only on the temperature difference between Loop Demand Side and the Loop Supply Side.~ The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate.~ ~This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:WatersideEconomizer object prior to version 8.0.
\item
  \textbf{CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride}.  This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger operation is integrated with the operation of a specific chiller.  Typically the heat exchanger and chiller are in parallel on separate branches.  When conditions are favorable for the heat exchanger to provide cooling to the Loop Supply Side, the heat exchanger is run and the integrated chiller is turned off.  When conditions are not favorable, the heat exchanger is competely off and the chiller is allowed to run as usual.  A cooling setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.  If it runs it will run at full capacity and may undershoot the setpoint.  The chiller that is integrated with the heat exchanger is identified by entering the names of the chiller's inlet nodes in the input fields below.~ The control decision can be based on one of three different temperature signals selected in the field below called Component Override Cooling Control Temperature Mode.~ The setpoint and control signal temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:Hydronic object prior to version 8.0.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Heat Exchanger Setpoint Node Name}\label{field-heat-exchanger-setpoint-node-name}

This field specifies the name of a plant system node located on loop attached to the Loop Supply Side.~ This field is used and required when the previous field is set to one of the ``Setpoint'' control types.~ The node must have a temperature setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager (or EMS actuator).

If the previous field is set to DualDeadbandSetpointModulated or DeadbandSetpointOnOff then there must be a setpoint manager that places both a high and low setpoint on the node named in this field. (see SetpointManager:Scheduled:DualSetpoint).

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger}\label{field-minimum-temperature-difference-to-activate-heat-exchanger}

\paragraph{Field: Heat Transfer Metering End Use Type}\label{field-heat-transfer-metering-end-use-type}

This field specifies how the metering for heat transfer will be accounted with respect to end uses.~ Although the heat exchanger consumes no energy that needs to be metered, there are also meters for heat transfers that apply to the model. The nature of the end use may vary depending on the application that the heat exchanger is being used for.~ The available choices are FreeCooling, HeatRecovery, HeatRejection, HeatRecoveryForCooling, HeatRecoveryForHeating, and LoopToLoop.

\paragraph{Field: Component Override Loop Supply Side Inlet Node Name}\label{field-component-override-loop-supply-side-inlet-node-name}

This field specifies the name of an inlet node for the remote component that will be integrated with this heat exchanger.~ This inlet should be on the supply side of a loop -- typically chilled water inlet or return for a chiller.~ This field and the next two are only used for the control type called CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride.

\paragraph{Field: Component Override Loop Demand Side Inlet Node Name}\label{field-component-override-loop-demand-side-inlet-node-name}

This field specifies the name of an inlet node for the remote component that will be integrated with this heat exchanger.~ This inlet should be on the demand side of a loop -- typically condenser water inlet or return for a water-cooled chiller.~ This field is only used for the control type called CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride.

\paragraph{Field: Component Override Cooling Control Temperature Mode}\label{field-component-override-cooling-control-temperature-mode}

This field specifies which type of temperature is used to control a heat exchanger that uses the control type called CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride.~ There are three options: Loop, WetBulbTemperature, and DryBulbTemperature.~ The option called ``Loop'' directs the program to use the inlet fluid temperature at the Loop Demand Side connection of~ heat exchanger for the temperature used as a signal to be compared with the setpoint. The option call ``WetBulbTemperature'' uses the outdoor air wetbulb temperature as the signal.~ The option called ``DryBulbTemperature'' uses the outdoor air drybulb temperature as the signal.

\paragraph{Field: Sizing Factor}\label{field-sizing-factor-4}

This optional field can be used to modify the results of autosize calculations.~ This sizing factor is used for this heat exchanger and modifies sizing results by multiplying them by the factor entered here.~ This factor is applied to the Loop Supply Side Design Flow rate and in turn affects the heat exchanger UA and the loop demand side flow rate which are derived from that flow rate.~ This allows fine control over the size of the heat exchanger when using autosize in those fields.

\paragraph{Field: Operation Minimum Temperature Limit}\label{field-operation-minimum-temperature-limit}

This optional field can be used to provide supervisory control of the heat exchanger. If either of the inlet temperatures are below this limit (°C), the heat exchanger will not operate.

\paragraph{Field: Operation Maximum Temperature Limit}\label{field-operation-maximum-temperature-limit}

This optional field can be used to provide supervisory control of the heat exchanger. If either of the inlet temperatures are above this limit~ (°C), the heat exchanger will not operate.
