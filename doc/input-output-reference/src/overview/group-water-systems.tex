\section{Group Water Systems}\label{group-water-systems}

This group of objects is used to describe the water systems in the building. EnergyPlus offers water modeling capabilities than include not only hot water systems but also the overall water systems including cold water uses, on-site water collection (e.g., from rain, condensate, or well), and storage. HVAC components may consume or collect a significant portion of the water making it appropriate to include water modeling in EnergyPlus.

All water systems are collected into an end use category called Water Systems . This category includes hot and cold water. Water consumed by an HVAC component will be assigned to the end use category for that component. End use subcategories are available to separate hot water from cold water if desired. Simple hot water systems can be configured as stand-alone or use a \hyperref[plantloop]{PlantLoop}. The Water Systems can be connected to \hyperref[plantloop]{PlantLoop}s for modeling heated water end uses. However \hyperref[plantloop]{PlantLoop}s are not used to model cold water and the \hyperref[waterusestorage]{WaterUse:Storage}s portions of the water system. Cold water systems are connected together using \hyperref[waterusestorage]{WaterUse:Storage} objects. \hyperref[wateruseconnections]{WaterUse:Connections} are used at the zone level to connect to both cold and hot water.

In addition to the input objects described in this section below, there are a variety of HVAC components that can be configured to interact with the water systems. These component input objects include optional fields that allow describing how the water systems are connected to them by providing the name of a storage tank. The following table lists EnergyPlus input objects that include provisions for connecting to the water systems but are described elsewhere in this document:

\subsection{WaterUse:Equipment}\label{wateruseequipment}

The WaterUse:Equipment object is a generalized object for simulating all water end uses. Hot and cold water uses are included, as well as controlled mixing of hot and cold water at the tap. The WaterUse:Equipment object can be used stand-alone, or coupled into a plant loop using the \hyperref[wateruseconnections]{WaterUse:Connections} object (see below). The \hyperref[wateruseconnections]{WaterUse:Connections} object allows water uses to be linked to \hyperref[waterusestorage]{WaterUse:Storage} objects to store and draw reclaimed water. The \hyperref[wateruseconnections]{WaterUse:Connections} object can also simulate drainwater heat recovery.

The WaterUse:Equipment object serves all of the same purposes as the existing objects: \hyperref[exteriorwaterequipment]{Exterior:WaterEquipment}, and \hyperref[hotwaterequipment]{HotWaterEquipment}.

The WaterUse:Equipment object does a better job of modeling domestic hot water by allowing mixing at the tap in order to account for both hot \textbf{and cold} water used at sinks, showers, etc. It also improves on the stand-alone energy modeling of domestic hot water. Because all of the temperatures and flow rates can be solved, the energy usage can be accounted for as ``Purchased Heating''.

In either stand-alone mode or used with the \hyperref[wateruseconnections]{WaterUse:Connections} object, the WaterUse:Equipment object will attempt to meet a scheduled target temperature at the tap by mixing hot and cold water flows. If the hot water flow is not hot enough, or if the flow is limited by plant loop constraints, the result is a cooler mixed water temperature and the target temperature will not be met. In stand-alone mode the hot and cold water temperatures are specified by schedules. However, if the cold water schedule is omitted, the water temperature will be calculated by the \hyperref[sitewatermainstemperature]{Site:WaterMainsTemperature} object. If the hot water schedule or target temperature schedule are omitted, all water is delivered as cold water. If only using cold water, the WaterUse:Equipment object is similar to the \hyperref[exteriorwaterequipment]{Exterior:WaterEquipment} object.

The WaterUse:Equipment object improves on the internal gains object \hyperref[hotwaterequipment]{HotWaterEquipment} by associating actual water usage with a sensible and latent gain to a zone. Equipment, such as showers, that generate a significant heat gain can be modeled using the Sensible Fraction Schedule and Latent Fraction Schedule fields. The schedules are used to set the fraction of the maximum possible heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that should be added to the zone. The split between sensible and latent will vary depending on the type of equipment that is to be modeled. Typically, both fractions should be small numbers.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-053}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-051}

The unique object name for reference by other objects.

\paragraph{Field: End-Use Subcategory}\label{field-end-use-subcategory-005}

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Laundry'', ``Dish Washing'', etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: \hyperref[outputmeter-and-outputmetermeterfileonly]{Output:Meter} objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table under the ``Water Systems'' end-use category and also appear in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the water use will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

\caption{Diagram of internal connections for WaterUse:Connections \protect \label{fig:diagram-of-internal-connections-for-wateruse}}
\end{figure}

The WaterUse:Connections object can be used stand-alone or coupled into a plant loop. In stand-alone mode, the Hot and Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedules override the values for the listed \hyperref[wateruseequipment]{WaterUse:Equipment} objects. When coupled to the plant, the Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule is overridden by the actual plant loop inlet water temperature. When coupled to the plant, the WaterUse:Connections object should be on a \hyperref[branch]{Branch} object whose control type is set to Active.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-050}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-048}

The unique object name for reference by other objects.

\paragraph{Field: Inlet Node Name}\label{field-inlet-node-name-008}

The hot water inlet node when connected to a plant loop. The hot water supplies all of the \hyperref[wateruseequipment]{WaterUse:Equipment} objects that demand hot water. Insufficient supply temperature or flow results in cooler water at the tap.

\paragraph{Field: Outlet Node Name}\label{field-outlet-node-name-009}

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-002}

Reference to the \hyperref[waterusestorage]{WaterUse:Storage} object that supplies cold water to the listed \hyperref[wateruseequipment]{WaterUse:Equipment} objects. If the field is blank, or the tank is empty, fresh water is supplied from the water mains.

\paragraph{Field: Reclamation Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-reclamation-water-storage-tank-name}

Reference to the \hyperref[waterusestorage]{WaterUse:Storage} object that stores the resulting graywater from the listed \hyperref[wateruseequipment]{WaterUse:Equipment} objects. If the field is blank, the graywater is not reclaimed.

\paragraph{Field: Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name}\label{field-hot-water-supply-temperature-schedule-name-1}

Reference to the schedule object specifying the hot water temperature {[}C{]}. If blank in stand-alone mode, the hot water supply temperature defaults to the cold water supply temperature. This field (even if blank) overrides the Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule in all of the listed \hyperref[wateruseequipment]{WaterUse:Equipment} objects.

\paragraph{Field: Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name}\label{field-cold-water-supply-temperature-schedule-name-1-000}

Reference to the schedule object specifying the cold water temperature {[}C{]} from the supply mains that provides the cold water to the tap and makes up for all water lost down the drain. If blank, water temperatures are calculated by the \hyperref[sitewatermainstemperature]{Site:WaterMainsTemperature} object.

This field (even if blank) overrides the Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule in all of the listed \hyperref[wateruseequipment]{WaterUse:Equipment} objects.

\paragraph{Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger Type}\label{field-drain-water-heat-exchanger-type}

The heat exchanger type to be used for drainwater heat recovery. None indicates no heat recovery is to be simulated. Ideal sets a heat exchanger effectiveness of 1.0. Effectiveness is calculated dynamically for CounterFlow and CrossFlow options.

One popular type of drainwater heat exchanger is the Gravity-Film Heat Exchanger (GFX). The GFX is most closely approximated with the CounterFlow option, but keep in mind that the UA varies more with flow rate for the GFX than for most traditional heat exchangers.

\paragraph{Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger Destination}\label{field-drain-water-heat-exchanger-destination}

The heat exchanger configuration to be used for drainwater heat recovery. The configuration determines where the heat will be used after it is recovered.

Plant indicates that the all of the recovered heat will be sent to the return flow at the outlet node of the WaterUse:Connections object to preheat the make-up cold water from the water mains.

Equipment indicates that the all of the recovered heat will be used to preheat the cold water flow side of the \hyperref[wateruseequipment]{WaterUse:Equipment} objects listed \emph{in this} WaterUse:Connections object

PlantAndEquipment indicates the recovered heat will be divided between the plant and the \hyperref[wateruseequipment]{WaterUse:Equipment} objects, as described above. This is the only option where the flow rates are equal in the drain and the heat exchanger.

\paragraph{Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger U-Factor Times Area}\label{field-drain-water-heat-exchanger-u-factor-times-area}

The UA is the heat transfer coefficient {[}W/K{]} for the heat exchanger and is the product of U, the overall heat transfer coefficient, and A, the heat exchanger surface area.

\subsection{WaterUse:Storage}\label{waterusestorage}

The WaterUse:Storage object is a central component for complex water systems. This object is not needed if the only use of water is directly from the mains, or utility service water. If the building model is to include any on-site collection or wells or storing and reuse of graywater, then a WaterUse:Storage is needed. Each WaterUse:Storage can serve as a central node and make connections to numerous sources of supply or numerous components with demand. If a maximum capacity is not specified, the tank is assumed to have unlimited capacity. This is useful for sizing.

Storage tanks may handle a lot of water but show no use. This is because water usage is metered at the component level were water is used up. The only water a storage tank might use up is overflow water if it is discarded.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-046}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-2-043}

\paragraph{Field: Design Out Flow Rate}\label{field-design-out-flow-rate}

The design flow rate {[}m3/s{]} of fitting that withdraw water from the tank to end uses. Heavy demand (landscaping?) might be limited by pipe size or filtration. If Blank, this field defaults to unlimited rate.

\paragraph{Field: Overflow Destination}\label{field-overflow-destination}

Used if the well or other tank cannot keep up with the needs of the main float valve. If left blank or equal 0.0, then there is no mains water backup. If specified, then mains water will be drawn once the storage tank reaches this level and then the mains water will fill all the way to capacity specified in the previous field.

\paragraph{Field: Other Tank Name}\label{field-other-tank-name}

This field contains the name of another WaterUse:Storage defined elsewhere in the input file. This field is only used if the Type of Controlled Supply field is set to OtherTank and the current tank is to be configured to be supplied by a second tank in response to a float valve.
