\section{Group -- Variable Refrigerant Flow Equipment}\label{group-variable-refrigerant-flow-equipment}

This group of EnergyPlus input objects describes the configurations of Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF, or Variable Refrigerant Volume) air-conditioning systems.

A VRF system is an air-conditioning system that varies the refrigerant flow rate using variable speed compressor(s) in the outdoor unit, and the electronic expansion valves (EEVs) located in each indoor unit. The system meets the space cooling or heating load requirements by maintaining the zone air temperature at the setpoint. The ability to control the refrigerant mass flow rate according to the cooling and/or heating load enables the use of as many as 60 or more indoor units with differing capacities in conjunction with one single outdoor unit. This unlocks the possibility of having individualized comfort control, simultaneous heating and cooling in different zones, and heat recovery from one zone to another. It may also lead to more efficient operations during part-load conditions.

There are two alternative VRF models in EnergyPlus:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{System curve based model (VRF-SysCurve)}. In this model, a number of system level curves are used to describe the VRF system performance. This model corresponds to the \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object.
\item
  \textbf{Physics based model (VRF-FluidTCtrl)}. This model is able to consider the dynamics of more operational parameters and is applicable for fluid temperature control. This model corresponds to the \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl} object.
\end{enumerate}

(Please refer to the engineering reference for more technical details of the two models).

In the VRF system model, direct-expansion cooling and/or heating coils are configured in a zone terminal unit, which is connected to a zone via the zone inlet and exhaust nodes. The zone terminal units are identified in a \emph{ZoneTerminalUnitList} object, the name of which is entered as an input to the \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} or \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl} object.

The Energyplus connection methodology is shown as dashed and greyed arrows in Figure~\ref{fig:variable-refrigerant-flow-schematic} according to the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The zone inlet and zone exhaust node names are defined in a \emph{ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} object (bottom of figure).
\item
  A \emph{ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object will identify these zone exhaust and zone inlet node names as the terminal unit's air inlet and air outlet nodes, respectively.
\item
  All zone terminal units that are connected to the same \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} or \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl} object are listed in a \emph{ZoneTerminalUnitList} object.
\item
  The name of the \emph{ZoneTerminalUnitList} object is an input to the \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} or \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl} object.
\item
  The \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl} or \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object is not listed in an AirloopHVAC object, and therefore, can only be simulated if the terminal units are connected to the \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} or \emph{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl} object using the ZoneTerminalUnitList.
\item
  Secondary ZoneHVAC equipment objects may be used in the same zones as the terminal units for other purposes (e.g., code compliance)
\end{itemize}

The following schematic demonstrates these connection rules.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-051}

\paragraph{Field: Heat Pump Name}\label{field-heat-pump-name}

This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a variable refrigerant flow heat pump. Any reference to this heat pump will use this name. Since this object is not listed in an AirloopHVAC object, the most likely use of this name would be for reporting purposes.

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump must be off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the heat pump is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the heat pump (and all of its terminal units) as required. If this field is blank, the unit is enabled the entire simulation.

This alpha field defines the cooling energy input ratio modifier at low outdoor temperatures. This curve is a bi-quadratic equation with a weighted average indoor wet-bulb temperature and condenser entering air dry-bulb temperature as the independent variables. If the \textit{Condenser Type} is WaterCooled, then the cooling energy input ratio modifier curve will be function of weighted average indoor air wet-bulb temperature and outdoor condenser entering water temperature. This performance curve can be used to describe the cooling energy input ratio at low outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are used) or can be used to describe the performance for all outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are not used).

This curve is used when the trend in cooling energy changes dramatically as outdoor temperature changes. If the cooling energy does not change dramatically with changes in outdoor conditions, this field may be left blank. See the Engineering Reference for more discussion on using this input field.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Low Part-Load Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-cooling-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-low-part-load-ratio-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the cooling energy input ratio modifier (function of part-load ratio when PLR is less than or equal to 1) curve name. This curve is a linear, quadratic or cubic equation with cooling part-load ratio used as the independent variable. The cooling energy input ratio modifier curve is normalized to 1 at a part-load ratio of 1 and is used only when the operating part-load ratio is less than or equal to 1.

This alpha field defines the cooling combination ratio (CR) correction factor curve name for combination ratios greater than or equal to 1. The combination ratio is defined as the total rated indoor terminal unit cooling capacity divided by this heat pump's gross rated total cooling capacity. The curve is a linear, quadratic or cubic equation and uses the minimum value of x in the curve object to determine the maximum part-load ratio which is linearly proportional to capacity (i.e., the minimum value of x {[}CR{]} in the curve object must be ≥1). The output of this curve provides a multiplier (\textgreater{}1) which is applied to this heat pump's Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity. Between a combination ratio of 1 and the curve's minimum value of x, the multiplier is linearly interpolated. For combination ratio's less than 1 (i.e., the total indoor terminal unit capacity is less than this heat pump's rated total capacity), capacity is directly proportional to part-load ratio and this curve will not be used.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Part-Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-cooling-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the cooling part-load fraction correlation curve name. This curve is used to define the cycling losses when the condenser's compressors cycle on and off.

This numeric field defines the ratio of gross heating to gross cooling capacity. The model assumes that when used, this value will be greater than 1. A similar input is available in the ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow object. When the heating capacity is autosized, if this field is non-blank, this ratio is used to scale the heating capacity to the gross rated total cooling capacity regardless of the value entered in the terminal unit objects. When the heating capacity is not autosized, the gross rated heating capacity will be equal to the value specified in the Gross Rated Heating Capacity input field and this value will be compared to the sum of the terminal unit heating coil size. If these values are more than 10\% different, a warning will be issued when Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings; is included in the input file. If this field is blank and the terminal unit sizing ratio input is also blank, then the heating capacity sizing ratio is assumed to be 1. If this field is not blank and the heating capacity sizing ratio in the terminal unit object(s) is blank, then this ratio also applies to each heating coil. If this field is not blank and the heating capacity sizing ratio in the terminal units is also not blank, then the terminal unit heating coil capacity sizing ratio input applies to each heating coil.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Heating COP}\label{field-gross-rated-heating-cop-001}

This numeric field defines the heating coefficient of performance at rated conditions. The heating coefficient of performance includes compressor power and condenser fan power. This gross COP value does NOT account for~ the supply air fan. The nominal heat pump heating COP must be greater than 0. If this field is left blank, a coefficient of performance of 3.4 is assumed.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outdoor Temperature in Heating Mode}\label{field-minimum-outdoor-temperature-in-heating-mode-000}

This curve is a bi-quadratic equation with a weighted average indoor dry-bulb temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet temperatures) and condenser entering air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature as the independent variables. Since manufacturers may provide performance data using either outdoor dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperatures, either of these temperature types may be used for heating performance curves as specified in the Heating Performance Curve Outdoor Temperature Type input field below. This performance curve can be used to describe the heating capacity ratio at low outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are used) or can be used to describe the performance for all outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are not used).

If the heating energy does not change dramatically with changes in outdoor conditions, this field may be left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Performance Curve Outdoor Temperature Type}\label{field-heating-performance-curve-outdoor-temperature-type}

This choice field defines the outdoor temperature type used for all performance curves. The valid choices are DryBulbTemperature and WetBulbTemperature. The default value is WetBulbTemperature. Manufacturers will typically provide heating performance data as a function of outdoor air wet-bulb temperatures. This means that the performance (e.g., capacity and energy input ratio) curves will use outdoor wet-bulb temperature as one of the independent variables. At times, manufacturers will only provide performance data as a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperatures. In this case, all performance curves shall be developed using outdoor dry-bulb temperature and this field shall be selected as DryBulbTemperature.

This alpha field defines the heating energy input ratio modifier (function of part-load ratio when PLR is less than or equal to 1) curve name. This curve is a linear, quadratic, or cubic equation with heating part-load ratio used as the independent variable.

This alpha field defines the heating combination ratio (CR) correction factor curve name for combination ratios greater than or equal to 1. The combination ratio is defined as the total rated indoor heating capacity divided by the rated heat pump heating capacity. The curve is either quadratic or cubic and uses the minimum value of x in the curve object to determine the maximum part-load ratio which is linearly proportional to capacity (i.e., the minimum value of x in the curve object must be ≥1). The output of this curve provides a multiplier (\textgreater{}1) which is applied to the Nominal Heat Pump Heating Capacity. Between a combination ratio of 1 and the curve's minimum value of x, the multiplier is linearly interpolated. For combination ratio's less than 1, capacity is directly proportional to part-load ratio and this curve will not be used.

The compressor cycles when the indoor to outdoor heating capacity ratio is less than the Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio specified in the following field.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio}\label{field-minimum-heat-pump-part-load-ratio-000}

This numeric field specifies the minimum operating part-load ratio (PLR) of the heat pump. When the heat pump operates at a PLR below this value, the heat pump's compressor will cycle to meet the cooling or heating demand. Above this value, the heat pump's compressor operates the entire time step to meet the cooling or heating demand. The minimum value for this field is 0. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.15. When the heat pump compressor cycles, the previous field is used to determine cycling losses.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name for Master Thermostat Location}\label{field-zone-name-for-master-thermostat-location-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the zone where the ``master'' thermostat is located. When the heat pump is connected to multiple zone terminal units, one terminal unit must be selected as the master thermostat. The remaining thermostats are slaves and can operate only in the same mode as the master thermostat.

\paragraph{Field: Master Thermostat Priority Control Type}\label{field-master-thermostat-priority-control-type-000}

This choice field determines the logic used to simulate the ``master'' thermostat. Valid choices are LoadPriority, ZonePriority, ThermostatOffsetPriority, MasterThermostatPriority, and Scheduled. The default value is MasterThermostatPriority. When LoadPriority is selected, the total zone load is used to choose the operating mode as either cooling or heating. When ZonePriority is selected, the number of zones requiring cooling or heating determines the operating mode. When ThermostatOffsetPriority is selected, the zone farthest from the thermostat set point determines the operating mode. The MasterThermostatPriority choice operates the system according the zone load where the master thermostat is located.

Note: the previous field is designated at the last field necessary to simulate the variable refrigerant flow heat pump. The following fields do not have to be entered, however, piping loses, defrost operation, crankcase heater operation, and basin heater operation will not be modeled. Defaults for fields not entered may also not apply. These remaining fields must be entered if that portion of the model is to be simulated.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Pump Waste Heat Recovery}\label{field-heat-pump-waste-heat-recovery-000}

This choice field defines the configuration of the heat pump refrigeration system. Valid choices are \textbf{Yes} and \textbf{No}.

This value includes the gas refrigerant line length (for both horizontal and vertical distances), fitting losses, pipe bends, and other connections that contribute to piping losses. This field is used to calculate the piping correction factor in cooling mode. This value defines the head losses due to the pipe length between the farthest terminal unit and the heat pump condenser and impacts the maximum available capacity in cooling mode.

\paragraph{Field: Vertical Height used for Piping Correction Factor}\label{field-vertical-height-used-for-piping-correction-factor-000}

This numeric field defines the vertical pipe height in meters between the highest or lowest terminal unit and the heat pump condenser. This value defines the gravitational losses due to a change in height between the highest (positive value), or lowest (negative value) terminal unit and the heat pump condenser. The distance specified here is applied to the piping correction factor calculation for both cooling and heating. If the distance between the highest terminal unit above the heat pump condenser is greater than the distance between the lowest terminal unit below the condenser enter the difference between the highest and lowest terminal units as a positive distance, otherwise enter this difference as a negative distance. Example: if the distance from the heat pump condenser to the highest terminal unit above the condenser is 10 m and the distance from the heat pump condenser to the lowest terminal unit below the condenser is -15 m, then enter a value of -5 m in this field. This head loss impacts the maximum available capacity in cooling mode.

\paragraph{Field: Piping Correction Factor for Length in Cooling Mode Curve Name}\label{field-piping-correction-factor-for-length-in-cooling-mode-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the linear, quadratic, or cubic curve name used to calculate the piping correction factor for length in cooling mode. Piping losses are a function of piping length. If sufficient piping loss information is available where piping losses are also a function of combination ratio (i.e., in addition to length), a biquadratic performance curve may be used.

\paragraph{Field: Piping Correction Factor for Height in Cooling Mode Coefficient}\label{field-piping-correction-factor-for-height-in-cooling-mode-coefficient}

This numeric field defines the coefficient used to calculate the piping correction factor for height in cooling mode.

\paragraph{Field: Equivalent Piping Length used for Piping Correction Factor in Heating Mode}\label{field-equivalent-piping-length-used-for-piping-correction-factor-in-heating-mode-000}

This numeric field defines the equivalent pipe length in meters between the farthest terminal unit and the heat pump condenser. This value includes the liquid refrigerant line length (for both horizontal and vertical distances), fitting losses, pipe bends, and other connections that contribute to piping losses. This field is used to calculate the piping correction factor in heating mode. This value defines the head losses due to the pipe length between the farthest terminal unit and the heat pump condenser and impacts the maximum available capacity in heating mode.

\paragraph{Field: Piping Correction Factor for Length in Heating Mode Curve Name}\label{field-piping-correction-factor-for-length-in-heating-mode-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the linear, quadratic, or cubic curve name used to calculate the piping correction factor for length in heating mode. Piping losses are a function of piping length. If sufficient piping loss information is available where piping losses are also a function of combination ratio (i.e., in addition to length), a biquadratic performance curve may be used.

\paragraph{Field: Piping Correction Factor for Height in Heating Mode Coefficient}\label{field-piping-correction-factor-for-height-in-heating-mode-coefficient}

This numeric field defines the coefficient used to calculate the piping correction factor for height in heating mode.

\paragraph{Field: Crankcase Heater Power per Compressor}\label{field-crankcase-heater-power-per-compressor-000}

This numeric field defines the electrical power consumed by the crankcase heater in watts for \emph{each} compressor. This crankcase heater power is consumed when the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for crankcase heater operation. The minimum value for this field is 0. If this field is left blank, the default value is 33 watts. Crankcase heater electrical consumption is applied only when the compressor is off or is applied during the off cycle when the compressor is cycling below the Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on heat pump performance.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Compressors}\label{field-number-of-compressors-000}

This numeric field defines the number of compressors in the heat pump condensing unit and is used exclusively to determine the operating characteristics of the crankcase heater. For example, if the number of compressors is 3, one crankcase heater will operate when the heat pump condensing unit's part-load ratio is less than or equal to 0.67 (when the ratio of compressor size to total compressor capacity input is 0.33) and the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation. Similarly, two crankcase heaters will operate when the heat pump condensing unit's PLR is less than or equal to 0.33 and the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation. If the heat pump condensing unit is off, all 3 crankcase heaters will operate if the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation. The minimum value for this field is 1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on heat pump performance.

\paragraph{Field: Ratio of Compressor Size to Total Compressor Capacity}\label{field-ratio-of-compressor-size-to-total-compressor-capacity-000}

This numeric field defines the size of the first stage compressor to the total compressor capacity and is used exclusively for calculating crankcase heater energy. If this field and the previous field are left blank, the default value is 0.5.~ If this field is left blank and the previous field is not blank, the compressors are assumed to be equally sized. When the number of compressors is greater than 2, the 2\(^{nd}\) stage compressor and all additional compressors are assumed to be equally sized. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on heat pump performance.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-000}

This numeric field defines the maximum outdoor temperature, in degrees Celsius, below which the crankcase heater will operate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0°C. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on heat pump performance.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Strategy}\label{field-defrost-strategy-001}

This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle. Defrost can be disabled by entering a resistive defrost strategy using a timed defrost control, a 0 defrost time period fraction and a 0 resistive defrost heater capacity in the following inputs fields. This method is used when the Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation field value is greater than the expected minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature simulated in the weather file.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Control}\label{field-defrost-control-001}

This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value of compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field ``Defrost Time Period Fraction'' described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field ``Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation'' described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-defrost-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the weighted average wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor terminal units (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}\label{field-defrost-time-period-fraction-001}

This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active. For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.

\paragraph{Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity}\label{field-resistive-defrost-heater-capacity-001}

This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost strategy is `resistive' (see input field ``Defrost Strategy'' above). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-defrost-operation-001}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which outdoor coil defrosting is disabled. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 5 C. Defrost can be completely eliminated by selecting a temperature lower than the minimum expected outdoor temperature found in the weather file.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Type}\label{field-condenser-type-003}

This choice field defines the configuration of the heat pump condenser. Valid choices are \textbf{AirCooled}, \textbf{EvaporativelyCooled}, and \textbf{WaterCooled}.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name}\label{field-condenser-inlet-node-name-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the condenser inlet air or water node. For Condenser type = AirCooled, this node name should also be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node or OutdoorAir:NodeList object. If this field is blank, the model assumes an air-cooled condenser and the weather file is used to define the outdoor conditions entering the condenser. If this field is not blank, the node conditions are used to define the outdoor air or inlet water conditions entering the condenser. A node name is typically entered here for air-cooled systems when conditions other than those found in the weather file should be used (ref. OutdoorAir:Node related to height above ground).

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name}\label{field-condenser-outlet-node-name-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the condenser outlet water node. This field is only used for water-cooled systems.

\paragraph{Field: Water Condenser Volume Flow Rate}\label{field-water-condenser-volume-flow-rate-000}

This numeric field defines the condenser water volume flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable and only used for water-cooled systems.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness-002}

The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:

\begin{equation}
Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)
\end{equation}

where

\emph{T\(_{cond\\ inlet}\)} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)

\emph{T\(_{wb,o}\)} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

\emph{T\(_{db,o}\)} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled and the simulation is calculating heating performance.

If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = EvapCooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.

If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = EvapCooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Cooling Capacity and Cooling EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-air-flow-rate-002}

The air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000144 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity {[}850 cfm/ton{]}). This field is not used when Condenser Type = AirCooled.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Pump Rated Power Consumption}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-pump-rated-power-consumption-001}

The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt {[}15 W/ton{]} of rated total cooling capacity). This field is not used when Condenser Type = AirCooled.

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-001}

This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the heat pump compressor(s) is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-004}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the heat pump is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name-003}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled.

The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the heat pump is off.

\paragraph{Field: Fuel Type}\label{field-fuel-type-005}

This alpha field determines the type of fuel that this variable refrigerant flow system uses.~ This field has seven choices: Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, OtherFuel1, and OtherFuel2. The default is Electricity. The use of alternate fuel types assumes an engine drives the variable speed compression system and also accounts for condenser air flow (i.e., a fan attached to the engine provides air flow through the outdoor condenser.

This curve is either a bi-quadratic equation using weighted average indoor temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet temperatures) and condenser entering air temperature as the independent variables or a cubic curve based on part-load ratio. This performance curve can be used to describe the cooling capacity modifier as either a constant (e.g., temperature or part-load ratio term coefficients are 0), a cooling modifier that varies with either indoor temperature and/or outdoor temperature, or part-load ratio (e.g., one or more temperature or part-load ratio term coefficients are 0), or varies with both indoor and outdoor temperatures or part-load ratio (e.g., all temperature or part-load ratio term coefficients are non-zero). If this field is left blank, and heat recovery operating mode is selected, the default constant modifier is 0.9. This modifier is applied only when heat recovery mode is active. To model a heat recovery system which has no degradation in cooling performance when heat recovery mode is active, or if the degradation is not constant at different operating conditions, a performance curve object must be used. This input is only used when Heat Pump Waste Heat Recovery is selected as Yes and the system changes from cooling only mode to heat recovery mode.

\paragraph{Field: Initial Heat Recovery Cooling Capacity Fraction}\label{field-initial-heat-recovery-cooling-capacity-fraction}

If this field is left blank, and heat recovery operating mode is selected, the default constant modifier is 1.1. This modifier is applied only when heat recovery mode is active. To model a heat recovery system which has no degradation in cooling performance when heat recovery mode is active, or if the degradation is not constant at different operating conditions, a performance curve object must be used.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Compressors}\label{field-number-of-compressors-1}

This numeric field defines the number of compressors in the heat pump condensing unit and is used exclusively to determine the operating characteristics of the crankcase heater. For example, if the number of compressors is 3, one crankcase heater will operate when the heat pump condensing unit's part-load ratio is less than or equal to 0.67 (when the ratio of compressor size to total compressor capacity input is 0.33) and the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation. Similarly, two crankcase heaters will operate when the heat pump condensing unit's PLR is less than or equal to 0.33 and the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-1}

This numeric field defines the maximum outdoor temperature, in degrees Celsius, below which the crankcase heater will operate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5°C. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on heat pump performance.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Strategy}\label{field-defrost-strategy-1-000}

This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle. Defrost can be disabled by entering a resistive defrost strategy using a timed defrost control, a 0 defrost time period fraction and a 0 resistive defrost heater capacity in the following inputs fields. This method is used when the Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation field value is greater than the expected minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature simulated in the weather file.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Control}\label{field-defrost-control-1-000}

This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value of compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field ``Defrost Time Period Fraction'' described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field ``Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation'' described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-defrost-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-temperature-curve-name-1}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the weighted average wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor terminal units (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}\label{field-defrost-time-period-fraction-1-000}

This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active. For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.

\paragraph{Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity}\label{field-resistive-defrost-heater-capacity-1-000}

This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost strategy is `resistive' (see input field ``Defrost Strategy'' above). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-defrost-operation-1-000}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which outdoor coil defrosting is disabled. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 5°C. Defrost can be completely eliminated by selecting a temperature lower than the minimum expected outdoor temperature found in the weather file.

\paragraph{Field: Compressor maximum delta Pressure}\label{field-compressor-maximum-delta-pressure}

This numeric field defines the maximum pressure increase that the compressor can provide. The value should be greater than 0. If this field is blank, the default value of 4,500,000 Pa is used.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Compressor Loading Index Entries}\label{field-number-of-compressor-loading-index-entries}

This numeric field defines the number of compressor loading index entries. Loading index specifies the VRF operational modes at various load conditions. In a single compressor system, loading index reflects the compressor speed. The model requires at least two loading indices.

\paragraph{Field: Compressor Speed at Loading Index i}\label{field-compressor-speed-at-loading-index-i}

This numeric field defines the compressor speed at the i-th loading index. The value must be greater than 0.

\paragraph{Field: Loading Index i Evaporative Capacity Multiplier Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-loading-index-i-evaporative-capacity-multiplier-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a BiQuadratic curve for the VRF operational mode corresponding to the i-th loading index. It parameterizes the variation of VRF evaporating capacity as a function of operating conditions, i.e., evaporating and condensing temperatures. The output of this curve is a dimensionless multiplier to be applied on the rated evaporative capacity to calculate the actual capacity.

\paragraph{Field: Loading Index i Compressor Power Multiplier Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-loading-index-i-compressor-power-multiplier-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a BiQuadratic curve for the VRF operational mode corresponding to the i-th loading index.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}

This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active.

\subsection{ZoneTerminalUnitList}\label{zoneterminalunitlist}

The zone terminal unit list defines the names of the terminal units connected to a single variable refrigerant flow air-conditioning system. The zone terminal unit list is used exclusively in the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioner object (ref: AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow). Up to 20 terminal units may be connected to a single VRF outdoor condensing unit. This list is extensible if additional indoor terminal units are required. The name of this zone terminal unit list object is then input into the corresponding variable refrigerant flow air conditioner object. The following figure demonstrates this concept.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-044}

\paragraph{Field: Zone Terminal List Name}\label{field-zone-terminal-list-name}

This alpha field specifies the name of the zone terminal unit list. This name must be specified in the AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow object.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Terminal Unit Name \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-zone-terminal-unit-name-x}

This alpha field defines the name of the zone terminal unit used in a variable refrigerant air conditioner. The zone terminal unit must be connected to a zone using the ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections object. The terminal unit air inlet node is the same name as a zone exhaust node. The terminal unit air outlet node is the same name as a zone inlet node. The IDD is supplied with 20 fields for this.~ The object is extensible and you can change the IDD by adding more fields or, if you are using text editor for your input file, just add to the list of names.

Following is an example input for a ZoneTerminalUnitList object.
