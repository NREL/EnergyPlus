\section{Group -- Variable Refrigerant Flow Equipment}\label{group-variable-refrigerant-flow-equipment}

This group of EnergyPlus input objects describes the configurations of Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF, or Variable Refrigerant Volume) air-conditioning systems.

A VRF system is an air-conditioning system that varies the refrigerant flow rate using variable speed compressor(s) in the outdoor unit, and the electronic expansion valves (EEVs) located in each terminal unit. For zone equipment the system meets the space cooling or heating load requirements by maintaining the zone air temperature at the setpoint or in the case of air loop equipment can meet a control zone load or maintain a terminal unit or coil outlet air temperature set point. The terminal unit may also be used in the air loop's outdoor air system where a terminal unit or coil outlet air temperature set point must be used. The ability to control the refrigerant mass flow rate according to the cooling and/or heating load enables the use of as many as 20 or more terminal units with differing capacities in conjunction with one single outdoor unit. This unlocks the possibility of having individualized comfort control, simultaneous heating and cooling in different zones, and heat recovery from one zone to another.

There are two alternative VRF models in EnergyPlus:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{System curve based model (VRF-SysCurve)}. In this model, a number of system level curves are used to describe the VRF system performance. This model corresponds to the \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow}} object.
\item
  \textbf{Physics based model (VRF-FluidTCtrl)}. This model is able to consider the dynamics of more operational parameters and is applicable for fluid temperature control. This model corresponds to the \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflowfluidtemperaturecontrol]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl}} object.
\end{enumerate}

(Please refer to the engineering reference for more technical details of the two models).

In the VRF system model, direct-expansion cooling and/or heating coils with an optional supplemental heating coil are configured in a zone terminal unit, which is connected to a zone via the zone inlet and exhaust nodes, connected to an air loop main branch or installed in the air loop's outdoor air system. The terminal units are identified in a \emph{\hyperref[zoneterminalunitlist]{ZoneTerminalUnitList}} object, the name of which is entered as an input to the \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow}} or \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflowfluidtemperaturecontrol]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl}} object.

The EnergyPlus connection methodology is shown as dashed and greyed arrows in Figure~\ref{fig:variable-refrigerant-flow-schematic} according to the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item
 For zone equipment the zone inlet and zone exhaust node names are defined in a \emph{\hyperref[zonehvacequipmentconnections]{ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}} object (bottom of figure) and the terminal unit type and name are specified in a \emph{\hyperref[zonehvacequipmentlist]{ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList}} object. For air loop equipment the terminal unit type and name and inlet and outlet node names are defined in the AirloopHVAC branch (top left of figure). For outside air system equipment the terminal unit type and name are defined in the \emph{\hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystemequipmentlist]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList}} (top right of figure) and the terminal unit inlet node will typically (but not necessarily) be an outside air node and the terminal unit outlet node will typically connect to the \emph{\hyperref[outdoorairmixer]{OutdoorAir:Mixer}} object.
\item
  A \emph{\hyperref[zonehvacterminalunitvariablerefrigerantflow]{ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow}} object will specify the terminal unit's air inlet and air outlet node names. For zone equipment the zone exhaust node is the terminal unit inlet node and the zone inlet node is the terminal unit outlet node. For air loop and outdoor air system equipment the terminal unit inlet and outlet node names identify the order of the equipment in the air loop.
\item
  All zone terminal units that are connected to the same \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow}} or \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflowfluidtemperaturecontrol]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl}} object are listed in a \emph{\hyperref[zoneterminalunitlist]{ZoneTerminalUnitList}} object.
\item
  The name of the \emph{\hyperref[zoneterminalunitlist]{ZoneTerminalUnitList}} object is an input to the \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow}} or \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflowfluidtemperaturecontrol]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl}} object.
\item
  The \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflowfluidtemperaturecontrol]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl}} or \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:Variable-RefrigerantFlow}} object is not listed in an AirloopHVAC object, and therefore, can only be simulated if the terminal units are connected to the \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow}} or \emph{\hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflowfluidtemperaturecontrol]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl}} object using the \hyperref[zoneterminalunitlist]{ZoneTerminalUnitList}.
\item
  Secondary ZoneHVAC equipment objects may be used in the same zones as the terminal units for other purposes (e.g., code compliance)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-051}

\paragraph{Field: Heat Pump Name}\label{field-heat-pump-name}

This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a variable refrigerant flow heat pump. Any reference to this heat pump will use this name. Since this object is not listed in an AirloopHVAC object, the most likely use of this name would be for reporting purposes.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-018}

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump must be off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the heat pump is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the heat pump (and all of its terminal units) as required. If this field is blank, the unit is enabled the entire simulation.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity}\label{field-gross-rated-total-cooling-capacity-001}

This numeric field defines the total cooling capacity (sensible + latent) of the heat pump at rated conditions in watts. The cooling capacity must be greater than 0 or set to autosize.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Cooling COP}\label{field-gross-rated-cooling-cop-001}

This numeric field defines the cooling coefficient of performance (COP) at rated conditions. The cooling COP includes compressor power and condenser fan power. This COP value does not account for impacts due to the supply air fan. The nominal heat pump cooling COP must be greater than 0. If this field is left blank, a default COP of 3.3 is assumed.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Condenser Inlet Node Temperature in Cooling Mode}\label{field-minimum-condenser-inlet-node-temperature-in-cooling-mode-000}

This curve is a bi-quadratic equation using weighted average indoor wet-bulb temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet temperatures) and condenser entering air dry-bulb temperature as the independent variables. If the \textit{Condenser Type} is WaterCooled, then the cooling capacity modifier curve will be function of weighted average indoor air wet-bulb temperature and outdoor condenser entering water temperature. This performance curve can be used to describe the cooling capacity ratio at low outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are used) or can be used to describe the performance for all outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are not used). For this system type it is likely that all three of these performance curves will be required. See the Engineering Reference for more discussion on using this input field.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Low Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-cooling-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-low-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the cooling energy input ratio modifier at low outdoor temperatures. This curve is a bi-quadratic equation with a weighted average indoor wet-bulb temperature and condenser entering air dry-bulb temperature as the independent variables. If the \textit{Condenser Type} is WaterCooled, then the cooling energy input ratio modifier curve will be function of weighted average indoor air wet-bulb temperature and outdoor condenser entering water temperature. This performance curve can be used to describe the cooling energy input ratio at low outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are used) or can be used to describe the performance for all outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are not used). For this system type it is likely that all three of these performance curves will be required. See the Engineering Reference for more discussion on using this input field.

This curve is used when the trend in cooling energy changes dramatically as outdoor temperature changes. If the cooling energy does not change dramatically with changes in outdoor conditions, this field may be left blank. See the Engineering Reference for more discussion on using this input field.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Low Part-Load Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-cooling-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-low-part-load-ratio-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the cooling energy input ratio modifier (function of part-load ratio when PLR is less than or equal to 1) curve name. This curve is a linear, quadratic or cubic equation with cooling part-load ratio used as the independent variable. The cooling energy input ratio modifier curve is normalized to 1 at a part-load ratio of 1 and is used only when the operating part-load ratio is less than or equal to 1. This curve's minimum PLR value must be less or equal to the value in the field Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of HIgh Part-Load Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-cooling-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-high-part-load-ratio-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the cooling energy input ratio modifier (function of part-load ratio when PLR is greater than 1) curve name.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Combination Ratio Correction Factor Curve Name}\label{field-cooling-combination-ratio-correction-factor-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the cooling combination ratio (CR) correction factor curve name for combination ratios greater than or equal to 1. The combination ratio is defined as the total rated indoor terminal unit cooling capacity divided by this heat pump's gross rated total cooling capacity. The curve is a linear, quadratic or cubic equation and uses the minimum value of x in the curve object to determine the maximum part-load ratio which is linearly proportional to capacity (i.e., the minimum value of x {[}CR{]} in the curve object must be ≥1). The output of this curve provides a multiplier (\textgreater{}1) which is applied to this heat pump's Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity. Between a combination ratio of 1 and the curve's minimum value of x, the multiplier is linearly interpolated. For combination ratio's less than 1 (i.e., the total indoor terminal unit capacity is less than this heat pump's rated total capacity), capacity is directly proportional to part-load ratio and this curve will not be used.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Part-Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-cooling-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the cooling part-load fraction correlation curve name. This curve is used to define the cycling losses when the condenser's compressors cycle on and off. The compressor cycles when the cooling part-load ratio is less than the Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio specified later in this object's inputs.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Heating Capacity}\label{field-gross-rated-heating-capacity-001}

This numeric field defines the gross total heat pump heating capacity at rated conditions in watts. The nominal heat pump heating capacity must be greater than 0 or set to autosize.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Heating Capacity Sizing Ratio}\label{field-rated-heating-capacity-sizing-ratio-000}

This numeric field defines the ratio of gross heating to gross cooling capacity. The model assumes that when used, this value will be greater than 1. A similar input is available in the \hyperref[zonehvacterminalunitvariablerefrigerantflow]{ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object. When the heating capacity is autosized, if this field is non-blank, this ratio is used to scale the heating capacity to the gross rated total cooling capacity regardless of the value entered in the terminal unit objects. When the heating capacity is not autosized, the gross rated heating capacity will be equal to the value specified in the Gross Rated Heating Capacity input field and this value will be compared to the sum of the terminal unit heating coil size. If these values are more than 10\% different, a warning will be issued when \hyperref[outputdiagnostics]{Output:Diagnostics}, DisplayExtraWarnings; is included in the input file. If this field is blank and the terminal unit sizing ratio input is also blank, then the heating capacity sizing ratio is assumed to be 1. If this field is not blank and the heating capacity sizing ratio in the terminal unit object(s) is blank, then this ratio also applies to each heating coil. If this field is not blank and the heating capacity sizing ratio in the terminal units is also not blank, then the terminal unit heating coil capacity sizing ratio input applies to each heating coil.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Heating COP}\label{field-gross-rated-heating-cop-001}

This numeric field defines the heating coefficient of performance (COP) at rated conditions. The heating COP includes compressor power and condenser fan power. This gross COP value does NOT account for impacts due to the supply air fan. The nominal heat pump heating COP must be greater than 0. If this field is left blank, a COP of 3.4 is assumed.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Condenser Inlet Node Temperature in Heating Mode}\label{field-minimum-condenser-inlet-node-temperature-in-heating-mode-000}

This numeric field defines the minimum source inlet temperature allowed for heating operation. For air-cooled equipment outdoor dry-bulb temperature is used. For water-cooled equipment inlet water temperature is used. Below this temperature, heating is disabled. If this field is left blank, the default value is -20ºC.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Condenser Inlet Node Temperature in Heating Mode}\label{field-maximum-condenser-inlet-node-temperature-in-heating-mode-000}

This numeric field defines the maximum source inlet temperature allowed for heating operation. For air-cooled equipment outdoor dry-bulb temperature is used. For water-cooled equipment inlet water temperature is used. Above this temperature, heating is disabled. If this field is left blank, the default value is 16ºC. This default temperature will likely disable water-cooled equipment and a more reasonable value should be entered.  Check manufacturers specifications.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Capacity Ratio Modifier Function of Low Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-heating-capacity-ratio-modifier-function-of-low-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the heating capacity ratio modifier at low temperature curve name. This curve is a bi-quadratic equation with a weighted average indoor dry-bulb temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet temperatures) and condenser entering air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature as the independent variables. Since manufacturers may provide performance data using either outdoor dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperatures, either of these temperature types may be used for heating performance curves as specified in the Heating Performance Curve Outdoor Temperature Type input field below. This performance curve can be used to describe the heating capacity ratio at low outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are used) or can be used to describe the performance for all outdoor temperatures (i.e., the following two curves are not used).

This curve is used when the trend in heating capacity changes dramatically as outdoor temperature changes. If the heating capacity does not change dramatically with changes in outdoor conditions, this field may be left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Capacity Ratio Modifier Function of High Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-heating-capacity-ratio-modifier-function-of-high-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the heating energy input ratio boundary curve name. This curve is a quadratic or cubic curve that defines a change in heating energy at a specific condenser entering air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature as a function of indoor air dry-bulb temperature. Since manufacturers may provide performance data using either outdoor dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperatures, either of these temperature types may be used for heating performance curves as specified in the Heating Performance Curve Outdoor Temperature Type input field below.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of High Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-heating-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-high-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the heating energy input ratio modifier at high temperature curve name. This curve is a bi-quadratic equation with a weighted average indoor dry-bulb temperature and condenser entering air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature as the independent variables. Since manufacturers may provide performance data using either outdoor dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperatures, either of these temperature types may be used for heating performance curves as specified in the Heating Performance Curve Outdoor Temperature Type input field below.

If the heating energy does not change dramatically with changes in outdoor conditions, this field may be left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Performance Curve Outdoor Temperature Type}\label{field-heating-performance-curve-outdoor-temperature-type}

This choice field defines the outdoor temperature type used for all performance curves. The valid choices are DryBulbTemperature and WetBulbTemperature. The default value is WetBulbTemperature. Manufacturers will typically provide heating performance data as a function of outdoor air wet-bulb temperatures. This means that the performance (e.g., capacity and energy input ratio) curves will use outdoor wet-bulb temperature as one of the independent variables. At times, manufacturers will only provide performance data as a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperatures. In this case, all performance curves shall be developed using outdoor dry-bulb temperature and this field shall be selected as DryBulbTemperature. If the \textit{Condenser Type} specified is \textit{WaterCooled}, then the value of this field should be \textit{DryBulbTemperature}. 

\paragraph{Field: Heating Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Low Part-Load Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-heating-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-low-part-load-ratio-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the heating energy input ratio modifier (function of part-load ratio when PLR is less than or equal to 1) curve name. This curve is a linear, quadratic, or cubic equation with heating part-load ratio used as the independent variable. The heating energy input ratio modifier curve is normalized to 1 at a part-load ratio of 1 and is used only when the part-load ratio is less than or equal to 1. This curve's minimum PLR value must be less or equal to the value in the field Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of High Part-Load Ratio Curve Name}\label{field-heating-energy-input-ratio-modifier-function-of-high-part-load-ratio-curve-name}

\paragraph{Field: Heating Combination Ratio Correction Factor Curve Name}\label{field-heating-combination-ratio-correction-factor-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the heating combination ratio (CR) correction factor curve name for combination ratios greater than or equal to 1. The combination ratio is defined as the total rated indoor heating capacity divided by the rated heat pump heating capacity. The curve is either quadratic or cubic and uses the minimum value of x in the curve object to determine the maximum part-load ratio which is linearly proportional to capacity (i.e., the minimum value of x in the curve object must be ≥1). The output of this curve provides a multiplier (\textgreater{}1) which is applied to the Nominal Heat Pump Heating Capacity. Between a combination ratio of 1 and the curve's minimum value of x, the multiplier is linearly interpolated. For combination ratio's less than 1, capacity is directly proportional to part-load ratio and this curve will not be used. If this field is left blank, the Cooling Combination Ratio Correction factor will be used.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Part-Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-heating-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the heating part-load fraction correlation curve name. This curve is used to define the cycling losses when the condenser's compressors cycle on and off. The compressor cycles when the indoor to outdoor heating capacity ratio is less than the Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio specified in the following field.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio}\label{field-minimum-heat-pump-part-load-ratio-000}

This numeric field specifies the minimum operating part-load ratio (PLR) of the heat pump. When the heat pump operates at a PLR below this value, the heat pump's compressor will cycle to meet the cooling or heating demand. Above this value, the heat pump's compressor operates the entire time step to meet the cooling or heating demand. The minimum value for this field is 0. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.15. When the heat pump compressor cycles, the previous field is used to determine cycling losses.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name for Master Thermostat Location}\label{field-zone-name-for-master-thermostat-location-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the zone where the ``master'' thermostat is located. When the heat pump is connected to multiple zone terminal units, one terminal unit must be selected as the master thermostat. The remaining thermostats are slaves and can operate only in the same mode as the master thermostat.

\paragraph{Field: Master Thermostat Priority Control Type}\label{field-master-thermostat-priority-control-type-000}

This choice field determines the logic used to simulate the ``master'' thermostat. Valid choices are LoadPriority, ZonePriority, ThermostatOffsetPriority, MasterThermostatPriority, and Scheduled. The default value is MasterThermostatPriority. When LoadPriority is selected, the total zone load is used to choose the operating mode as either cooling or heating. When ZonePriority is selected, the number of zones requiring cooling or heating determines the operating mode. When ThermostatOffsetPriority is selected, the zone farthest from the thermostat set point determines the operating mode. The MasterThermostatPriority choice operates the system according the zone load where the master thermostat is located. The heat pump can also be scheduled to operate in either cooling or heating mode. For scheduled operation, a schedule name is entered in the following field. When all terminal units connected to this system are set point controlled (set point control is only allowed in air loops and outdoor air systems) this field is not used.

\paragraph{Field: Thermostat Priority Schedule Name}\label{field-thermostat-priority-schedule-name-000}

This alpha field identifies the schedule used when the previous field is set to Scheduled. Schedule values of 0 denote heating mode while values of 1 denote cooling mode. Any other values will force the system off.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Terminal Unit List Name}\label{field-zone-terminal-unit-list-name}

This alpha field defines the name of the zone terminal unit list. The name specified here should match the name of a valid \hyperref[zoneterminalunitlist]{ZoneTerminalUnitList} object. In addition, each name specified in this list should match the name of a valid \hyperref[zonehvacterminalunitvariablerefrigerantflow]{ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object. All terminal units connected to this heat pump must be listed in this \hyperref[zoneterminalunitlist]{ZoneTerminalUnitList} object.

Note: the previous field is designated at the last field necessary to simulate the variable refrigerant flow heat pump. The following fields do not have to be entered, however, piping loses, defrost operation, crankcase heater operation, and basin heater operation will not be modeled. Defaults for fields not entered may also not apply. These remaining fields must be entered if that portion of the model is to be simulated.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Pump Waste Heat Recovery}\label{field-heat-pump-waste-heat-recovery-000}

This choice field defines the configuration of the heat pump refrigeration system. Valid choices are \textbf{Yes} and \textbf{No}. If Yes is selected, heat recovery is enabled and the heat pump can independently cool and heat different zones. If No is selected, the heat pump is only able to cool or heat for any given time step.

\paragraph{Field: Equivalent Piping Length used for Piping Correction Factor in Cooling Mode}\label{field-equivalent-piping-length-used-for-piping-correction-factor-in-cooling-mode-000}

This numeric field defines the equivalent pipe length in meters between the farthest terminal unit and the heat pump condenser. This value includes the gas refrigerant line length (for both horizontal and vertical distances), fitting losses, pipe bends, and other connections that contribute to piping losses. This field is used to calculate the piping correction factor in cooling mode. This value defines the head losses due to the pipe length between the farthest terminal unit and the heat pump condenser and impacts the maximum available capacity in cooling mode.

\paragraph{Field: Vertical Height used for Piping Correction Factor}\label{field-vertical-height-used-for-piping-correction-factor-000}

This numeric field defines the vertical pipe height in meters between the highest or lowest terminal unit and the heat pump condenser. This value defines the gravitational losses due to a change in height between the highest (positive value), or lowest (negative value) terminal unit and the heat pump condenser. The distance specified here is applied to the piping correction factor calculation for both cooling and heating. If the distance between the highest terminal unit above the heat pump condenser is greater than the distance between the lowest terminal unit below the condenser enter the difference between the highest and lowest terminal units as a positive distance, otherwise enter this difference as a negative distance.

This crankcase heater power is consumed when the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for crankcase heater operation. The minimum value for this field is 0. If this field is left blank, the default value is 33 watts. Crankcase heater electrical consumption is applied only when the compressor is off or is applied during the off cycle when the compressor is cycling below the Minimum Heat Pump Part-Load Ratio. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on heat pump performance.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Compressors}\label{field-number-of-compressors-000}

This numeric field defines the number of compressors in the heat pump condensing unit and is used exclusively to determine the operating characteristics of the crankcase heater.

Similarly, two crankcase heaters will operate when the heat pump condensing unit's PLR is less than or equal to 0.33 and the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation. If the heat pump condensing unit is off, all 3 crankcase heaters will operate if the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation. The minimum value for this field is 1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on heat pump performance.

\paragraph{Field: Ratio of Compressor Size to Total Compressor Capacity}\label{field-ratio-of-compressor-size-to-total-compressor-capacity-000}

This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle. Defrost can be disabled by entering a resistive defrost strategy using a timed defrost control, a 0 defrost time period fraction and a 0 resistive defrost heater capacity in the following inputs fields. This method is used when the Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation field value is greater than the expected minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature simulated in the weather file.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Control}\label{field-defrost-control-001}

This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value of compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field ``Defrost Time Period Fraction'' described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field ``Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation'' described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}\label{field-defrost-time-period-fraction-001}

This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active. For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.

\paragraph{Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity}\label{field-resistive-defrost-heater-capacity-001}

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Type}\label{field-condenser-type-003}

This choice field defines the configuration of the heat pump condenser. Valid choices are \textbf{AirCooled}, \textbf{EvaporativelyCooled}, and \textbf{WaterCooled}.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name}\label{field-condenser-inlet-node-name-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the condenser inlet air or water node. For Condenser type = AirCooled, this node name should also be listed in an \hyperref[outdoorairnode]{OutdoorAir:Node} or \hyperref[outdoorairnodelist]{OutdoorAir:NodeList} object. If this field is blank, the model assumes an air-cooled condenser and the weather file is used to define the outdoor conditions entering the condenser. If this field is not blank, the node conditions are used to define the outdoor air or inlet water conditions entering the condenser. A node name is typically entered here for air-cooled systems when conditions other than those found in the weather file should be used (ref. \hyperref[outdoorairnode]{OutdoorAir:Node} related to height above ground).

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness-002}

The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:

\begin{equation}
Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)
\end{equation}

where

\emph{T\(_{cond\\ inlet}\)} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)

\emph{T\(_{wb,o}\)} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

\emph{T\(_{db,o}\)} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled and the simulation is calculating heating performance.

If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = EvapCooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.

If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = EvapCooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Cooling Capacity and Cooling EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle. Defrost can be disabled by entering a resistive defrost strategy using a timed defrost control, a 0 defrost time period fraction and a 0 resistive defrost heater capacity in the following inputs fields.

For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field ``Defrost Time Period Fraction'' described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field ``Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation'' described above.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}\label{field-defrost-time-period-fraction-1-000}

The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.

Similarly, two crankcase heaters will operate when the VRF system condensing unit's PLR is less than or equal to 0.33 and the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation. If the VRF system condensing unit is off, all 3 crankcase heaters will operate if the outdoor temperature is below the maximum outdoor temperature for crankcase heater operation.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater}

This numeric field defines the maximum outdoor temperature, in degrees Celsius, below which the crankcase heater will operate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5°C. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on VRF system performance.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Strategy}

This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle. Defrost can be disabled by entering a resistive defrost strategy using a timed defrost control, a 0 defrost time period fraction and a 0 resistive defrost heater capacity in the following inputs fields. This method is used when the Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation field value is greater than the expected minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature simulated in the weather file.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Control}

This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value of compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field ``Defrost Time Period Fraction'' described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field ``Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation'' described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the weighted average wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor terminal units (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}

This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active. For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.

\paragraph{Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity}

This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost strategy is `resistive' (see input field ``Defrost Strategy'' above). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which outdoor coil defrosting is disabled. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 5°C. Defrost can be completely eliminated by selecting a temperature lower than the minimum expected outdoor temperature found in the weather file.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Recovery Cooling Capacity Time Constant}

This numeric field defines the cooling capacity time constant, in hours, used to model the time it takes for the system to change from cooling only operation to simultaneous cooling and heating. Total response time is defined as 5 time constants. If this field is left blank, a default value of 0.0 is used. If the transition period will not be modeled, the Initial Heat Recovery Cooling Capacity Fraction field must be set to 1.

\paragraph{Field: Initial Heat Recovery Cooling Energy Fraction}

\paragraph{Field: Heat Recovery Heating Capacity Time Constant}

This numeric field defines the heating capacity time constant, in hours, used to model the time it takes for the system to transition from heating only operation to simultaneous cooling and heating. Total response time is defined as 5 time constants. If this field is left blank, a default value of 0.0 is used. If the transition period will not be modeled, the Initial Heat Recovery Heating Capacity Fraction field must be set to 1.

\paragraph{Field: Initial Heat Recovery Heating Energy Fraction}

This numeric field defines the fraction of heating energy consumed when the system changes from heating only operation to simultaneous heating and cooling. It is common for the heating energy to decrease before the system recovers. If the transition period will not be modeled, this input field must be set to 1.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Recovery Heating Energy Time Constant}

This numeric field defines the heating energy time constant, in hours, used to model the time it takes for the system to change from cooling only operation to simultaneous cooling and heating. Total response time is defined as 5 time constants. If this field is left blank, a default value of 0.0 is used. If the transition period will not be modeled, the Initial Heat Recovery Heating Energy Fraction field must be set to 1.

\paragraph{Field: Compressor maximum delta Pressure}

This numeric field defines the maximum pressure increase that the compressor can provide. The value should be greater than 0. If this field is blank, the default value of 4,500,000 Pa is used.

\paragraph{Field: Compressor Inverter Efficiency}

This numeric field defines the efficiency of compressor inverter. It is the ratio between the output of Compressor Power Multiplier Function of Temperature Curve and the actual compressor power consumption. The value should be greater than 0. If this field is blank, the default value of 0.95 is used.

\paragraph{Field: Compressor Evaporative Capacity Correction Factor}

This numeric field defines the evaporative capacity difference because of system configuration difference between test bed and real system. It is the ratio between output of Evaporative Capacity Multiplier Function of Temperature Curve and the actual system evaporative capacity. The value should be greater than 0. If this field is blank, the default value of 1 is used.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Compressor Loading Index Entries}

This numeric field defines the number of compressor loading index entries. Loading index specifies the VRF operational modes at various load conditions. In a single compressor system, loading index reflects the compressor speed. The model requires at least two loading indices. The first index represents the minimal capacity operation, while the last index represents full capacity operation.

\paragraph{Field: Compressor Speed at Loading Index i}

This numeric field defines the compressor speed at the i-th loading index. The value must be greater than 0.

\paragraph{Field: Loading Index i Evaporative Capacity Multiplier Function of Temperature Curve Name}

This alpha field defines the name of a BiQuadratic curve for the VRF operational mode corresponding to the i-th loading index. It parameterizes the variation of VRF evaporating capacity as a function of operating conditions, i.e., evaporating and condensing temperatures. The output of this curve is a dimensionless multiplier to be applied on the rated evaporative capacity to calculate the actual capacity.

\paragraph{Field: Loading Index i Compressor Power Multiplier Function of Temperature Curve Name}

This alpha field defines the name of a BiQuadratic curve for the VRF operational mode corresponding to the i-th loading index. It parameterizes the variation of compressor power as a function of operating conditions, i.e., evaporating and condensing temperatures. The output of this curve is a dimensionless multiplier to be applied on the rated compressor power to calculate the actual compressor power.

\subsection{ZoneTerminalUnitList}\label{zoneterminalunitlist}

The zone terminal unit list defines the names of the terminal units connected to a single variable refrigerant flow air-conditioning system. The zone terminal unit list is used exclusively in the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioner object (ref: \hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow}). Up to 20 terminal units may be connected to a single VRF outdoor condensing unit. This list is extensible if additional indoor terminal units are required. The name of this zone terminal unit list object is then input into the corresponding variable refrigerant flow air conditioner object. The following figure demonstrates this concept.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-044}

\paragraph{Field: Zone Terminal List Name}\label{field-zone-terminal-list-name}

This alpha field specifies the name of the zone terminal unit list. This name must be specified in the \hyperref[airconditionervariablerefrigerantflow]{AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Terminal Unit Name \textless{}x\textgreater{}}\label{field-zone-terminal-unit-name-x}

This alpha field defines the name of the zone terminal unit used in a variable refrigerant air conditioner. The zone terminal unit must be connected to a zone using the \hyperref[zonehvacequipmentconnections]{ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} object. The terminal unit air inlet node is the same name as a zone exhaust node. The terminal unit air outlet node is the same name as a zone inlet node.  This object is extensible, so additional fields of this type can be added to the end of this object.

Following is an example input for a ZoneTerminalUnitList object.
