\subsection{Humidifier:Steam:Electric}\label{humidifiersteamelectric}

The electric steam humidifier is a component that represents an electrically heated, self contained steam humidifier. The component uses electrical energy to convert ordinary tap water to steam which it then injects into the supply air stream by means of a blower fan. The actual unit might be an electrode-type humidifier or a resistance-type humidifier.

The humidifier model includes local control of the humidifier unit to meet a humidity ratio setpoint on its air outlet node. A set point manager is needed to put a setpoint on the exit node but no other local controllers are needed. The humidifier will add moisture to meet the humidity ratio setpoint.

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the unit can run during a given time period. A schedule value of 0 indicates that the unit is off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the unit can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\subsection{Humidifier:Steam:Gas}\label{humidifiersteamgas}

The gas fired steam humidifier is a component that represents a gas fired self-contained steam humidifier. The component uses gas fired energy to convert ordinary tap water to steam which it then blows or injects into the supply air stream. Blower fan may not be required depending on how the dry steam is delivered into the supply air stream. The humidifier model includes local control of the humidifier unit to meet a humidity ratio setpoint on its air outlet node of the unit. A humidity set point manager is needed to put a setpoint on the outlet node but no other local controllers are needed. The humidifier either blows or injects dry steam to meet the humidity ratio setpoint requirement. If the Rated Gas Use Rate input field is not autosized, the thermal efficiency input specified will be ignored and ovverriden by a thermal efficiency value determined from user specified Rated Gas Use Rate, rated capacity (m3/s) and design conditions for sizing calculation.

If this input field is hardsized and the Inlet Water Temperature Option input field is selected as FixedInletWaterTemperature, then the thermal efficiency input field will not be used in the calculation or else if the Inlet Water Temperature Option input selected is VariableInletWaterTemperature, then the user specified thermal efficiency value will be overridden using internally calculated efficiency from the capacity, rated gas use rate and design condition.

\paragraph{Field: Thermal Efficiency}\label{field-thermal-efficiency}

The thermal efficiency of the gas fired humidifier. The thermal efficiency is based on the higher heating value of the fuel. The default value is 0.8. If Rated Gas Use Rate in the field above is not autosized and the Inlet Water Temperature Option input field selected is FixedInletWaterTemperature, then the thermal efficiency specified will be ignored in the calculation, or else if the Inlet Water Temperature Option input field is specified as VariableInletWaterTemperature, then the user specified thermal efficiency value will be overridden using internally calculated matching the capacity, rated gas use rate specified and design condition defined for sizing calculation.

\paragraph{Field: Thermal Efficiency Modifier Curve Name}\label{field-thermal-efficiency-modifier-curve-name}

This is thermal efficiency modifier curve name of unit. This curve is normalized, i.e., the curve output value at rated condition is 1.0. If this input field is blank, then constant efficiency value specified in the input field above will be used. Allowed thermal efficiency modifier curve types are linear, quadratic, or cubic. These curves are solely a function of part load ratio.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Fan Power}\label{field-rated-fan-power-1}

\paragraph{Field: Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-water-storage-tank-name-1}

This field is optional. If left blank or omitted, then the humidifier obtains its water directly from the mains water. If the name of a Water Storage Tank is specified, then the humidifier will try to obtain its water from that tank. If the tank can t provide all the water then the rest will be drawn from the mains and the humidifier will still operate.

\paragraph{Field: Inlet Water Temperature Option}\label{field-inlet-water-temperature-option}

This field is a key/choice field that tells which humidifier water inlet temperature to use: fixed inlet temperature or variable water inlet temperature that depends on the source. Currently allowed water sources are main water or water storage tank in water use objects. The key/choice are: FixedInletWaterTemperature, with this choice, the gas fired humidifier will use a fixed 20C water inlet temperature. VariableInletWaterTemperature, with this choice, the gas fired humidifier will use water inlet temperature that depends on the source temperature. If a water use storage tank name is specified, then the gas humidifier water inlet temperature will be the storage water temperature, or else it uses water main temperature. The default main water temperature is 10 °C. If left blank or omitted, then the humidifier assumes fixed inlet water temperature of 20 °C.
