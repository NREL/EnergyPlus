\section{Group Demand Limiting Controls}\label{group-demand-limiting-controls}

Demand limiting, or demand management, is a strategy for reducing a building's demand for utilities, e.g., electricity. Utility companies typically charge a monthly fee for ``demand charges'' that is based on the peak demand during a certain time period. Often the peak demand charge is set by one exceptional day that is much higher than the peak demand for an average day during the month. Therefore, to save utility costs, it is in the interest of building owners to find ways to manage the demand on peak days. While demand management is generally concerned with the demand for electricity, the future will likely see demand management of other utilities, such as natural gas or water.

Demand limiting controls shut off or reduce the power to non-essential loads in order to reduce the overall building demand. Some typical controls:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  shut off or dim electric lights, equipment, or HVAC systems
\item
  reset the thermostatic set points on HVAC systems
\item
  reduce the load of a set of similar components by rotating one or more components ``off'' for a short time interval
\item
  turn on generators to meet some or all of the building's demand.
\end{itemize}

The demand limiting controls implemented in EnergyPlus are intended to allow some of the more common demand limiting strategies. Currently, only Exterior:Lights, Lights, ElectricEquipment, ZoneControl:Thermostat, and Controller:OutdoorAir objects can be demand limited. Additional components will be demand limited in future releases.

\subsection{DemandManagerAssignmentList}\label{demandmanagerassignmentlist}

The DemandManagerAssignmentList object is a high level control that makes demand limiting decisions based on a list of possible demand limiting strategies. Each demand limiting strategy is described in a separate DemandManager object. (This is structured like the relationship between the AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList and the AvailabilityManager objects.)

Each DemandManagerAssignmentList monitors and demand limits one meter. Only electricity meters are currently allowed. In many cases, the meter will be \emph{Electricity:Facility}. A schedule and safety factor are used to set the demand limit above which the DemandManagers become activated. The billing month schedule and demand window are also taken into account when calculating the demand limit.

DemandManagers in the list are activated based on the \emph{Demand Manager Priority}. If the \textbf{Sequential} option is used, each manager in the list is activated in sequence from first to last until demand is reduced below the limit or until all managers are activated. If the \textbf{All} option is used, all managers are activated simultaneously to achieve the maximum demand reduction.

A DemandManager is skipped if it cannot reduce the demand. Possible reasons that a manager cannot reduce demand include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  not enough load to limit
\item
  not available because of its \emph{Availability Schedule}
\item
  already activated; load limited during a previous timestep.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-010}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-009}

The name of the DemandManagerAssignmentList object.

\paragraph{Field: Meter Name}\label{field-meter-name}

This field references the meter that is to be monitored and demand limited. Only electricity meters are currently allowed.

\paragraph{Field: Demand Limit Schedule Name}\label{field-demand-limit-schedule-name}

The reference to the schedule object specifying the target demand limits {[}schedule values should be in Watts{]}.

\paragraph{Field: Demand Limit Safety Fraction}\label{field-demand-limit-safety-fraction}

This field is a multiplier that is applied to the target demand limit (above). When the metered demand exceeds (target demand limit * safety fraction), the DemandManagers begin to limit the demand. This helps to ensure that the target limit is not exceeded.

\paragraph{Field: Billing Period Schedule Name}\label{field-billing-period-schedule-name}

The reference to the schedule object that defines the monthly billing periods. The peak demand during the peak period of the billing period typically determines the demand charge. This should reference the same schedule that is used in the \emph{Month Schedule Name} field of the UtilityCost:Tariff object. If left blank, it defaults to the regular divisions between months.

\paragraph{Field: Peak Period Schedule Name}\label{field-peak-period-schedule-name}

The reference to the schedule object that defines the peak/off-peak time-of-use periods. The peak demand during the peak period of the billing period typically determines the demand charge. This should reference the same schedule that is used in the \emph{Time of Use Period Schedule Name} field of the UtilityCost:Tariff object. A value of 1 indicates the peak period; any other value is off-peak. If left blank, it defaults to always on the peak period. The DemandManagerAssignmentList only attempts to demand limit during peak periods.

\paragraph{Field: Demand Window Length}\label{field-demand-window-length}

This field is similar to the field of the same name in the UtilityCost:Tariff object. However, the user may not want to limit using the same demand window as the utility company. This field allows the user to input the number of minutes over which to calculate the current demand. The minutes are rounded to match the nearest multiple of time steps.

\paragraph{Field: Demand Manager Priority}\label{field-demand-manager-priority}

This field indicates what logic should be used to activate the individual DemandManagers in the list. \textbf{Sequential} treats the list of DemandManagers as a sequential priority list, i.e., the first DemandManager in the list is activated first, then the second, etc., until the demand falls below the limit. \textbf{All} activates all demand managers to achieve the maximum demand reduction.

\paragraph{Field: Demand Manager Type 1}\label{field-demand-manager-type-1}

The key word defining the type of DemandManager.

\paragraph{Field: Demand Manager Name 1}\label{field-demand-manager-name-1}

The name of a DemandManager object defined elsewhere in the input file.

DemandManagers are listed by pairs of data items: \emph{Demand Manager Type} and \emph{Demand Manager Name}. Ten managers are accomodated in the list by default. The IDD specification, however, is extensible and additional pairs may be added by directly editing the IDD.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-4-002}

There are no output variables reported for the DemandManager:Thermostats object.

\subsection{DemandManager:Ventilation}\label{demandmanagerventilation}

The DemandManager:Ventilation object is used for limiting the ventilation rate calculated from the Controller:OutdoorAir object.

\subsubsection{Field: Name}\label{field-name-5-006}

The name of the DemandManager:Ventilation object.

\subsubsection{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-4-000}

The reference to the schedule object specifying the availability of this demand manager. A schedule value of zero indicates that this demand response (DR) is not applicable for that time period. A schedule greater than zero indicates that the demand response applies during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of one for all time period.

\subsubsection{Field: Limit Control}\label{field-limit-control-3}

This field specifies the type of limiting control. There are three options. The \textbf{FixedRate} option reduces the ventilation to a specified air flow rate. The \textbf{ReductionRatio} specifies the multiplier of the ventilation rate. The \textbf{Off} option disables the demand manager in the simulation.

\subsubsection{Field: Minimum Limit Duration}\label{field-minimum-limit-duration-3}

The minimum amount of time {[}minutes{]} that the demand manager will continue to demand limit after being activated. This prevent loads from turning on and off every time step.

\subsubsection{Field: Fixed Rate}\label{field-fixed-rate}

This field specifies the amount of fixed ventilation rate when the demand manager is active and \emph{FixedRate} limit control is applied. The unit is m3/s.

\subsubsection{Field: Reduction Ratio}\label{field-reduction-ratio}

This field specifies the multiplier of the ventilation rate when the demand manager is active and \emph{ReductionRatio} limit control is applied.

\subsubsection{Field: Limit Step Change}\label{field-limit-step-change-3}

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

\subsubsection{Field: Selection Control}\label{field-selection-control-4}

This field specifies which loads (ventilation rates) are selected to be limited. The \textbf{All} option simultaneously limits all of the loads listed in the demand manager. The \textbf{RotateMany} option limits all loads except for one which rotates sequentially through the loads listed. The \textbf{RotateOne} limits only one load which rotates sequentially through the loads listed. The time interval between rotations is set by the \emph{Rotation Duration} field.

\subsubsection{Field: Rotation Duration}\label{field-rotation-duration-4}

If the \textbf{RotateOne} of \textbf{RotateMany} option is used for \emph{Selection Control}, this field sets the time interval {[}minues{]} between rotations.

\subsubsection{Field: Controller Outdoor Air 1-10 Name}\label{field-controller-outdoor-air-1-10-name}

The names of Controller:OutdoorAir objects defined elsewhere in the input file. These are the ventilation rates to be limited by this demand manager. Then objects are accommodated in the list by default. The IDD specification, however, is extensible and additional fields may be added by directly editing the IDD.

An example IDF showing how this object is used is provided below:
