\subsection{Humidifier:Steam:Electric}\label{humidifiersteamelectric}

The electric steam humidifier is a component that represents an electrically heated, self contained steam humidifier. The component uses electrical energy to convert ordinary tap water to steam which it then injects into the supply air stream by means of a blower fan. The actual unit might be an electrode-type humidifier or a resistance-type humidifier.

The humidifier model includes local control of the humidifier unit to meet a humidity ratio setpoint on its air outlet node. A set point manager is needed to put a setpoint on the exit node but no other local controllers are needed. The humidifier will add moisture to meet the humidity ratio setpoint.

The component uses gas fired energy to convert ordinary tap water to steam which it then blows or injects into the supply air stream. Blower fan may not be required depending on how the dry steam is delivered into the supply air stream. The humidifier model includes local control of the humidifier unit to meet a humidity ratio setpoint on its air outlet node of the unit.

If this input field is hardsized and the Inlet Water Temperature Option input field is selected as FixedInletWaterTemperature, then the thermal efficiency input field will not be used in the calculation or else if the Inlet Water Temperature Option input selected is VariableInletWaterTemperature, then the user specified thermal efficiency value will be overridden using internally calculated efficiency from the capacity, rated gas use rate and design condition.

\paragraph{Field: Thermal Efficiency}\label{field-thermal-efficiency}

This field is optional. If left blank or omitted, then the humidifier obtains its water directly from the mains water. If the name of a Water Storage Tank is specified, then the humidifier will try to obtain its water from that tank. If the tank can t provide all the water then the rest will be drawn from the mains and the humidifier will still operate.

\paragraph{Field: Inlet Water Temperature Option}\label{field-inlet-water-temperature-option}

This field is a key/choice field that tells which humidifier water inlet temperature to use: fixed inlet temperature or variable water inlet temperature that depends on the source. Currently allowed water sources are main water or water storage tank in water use objects. The key/choice are: FixedInletWaterTemperature, with this choice, the gas fired humidifier will use a fixed 20C water inlet temperature. VariableInletWaterTemperature, with this choice, the gas fired humidifier will use water inlet temperature that depends on the source temperature. If a water use storage tank name is specified, then the gas humidifier water inlet temperature will be the storage water temperature, or else it uses water main temperature. The default main water temperature is 10 째C. If left blank or omitted, then the humidifier assumes fixed inlet water temperature of 20 째C.

ew = process entering humidity ratio {[}kgWater/kgDryAir{]}\\
vel = process air velocity {[}m/s{]}

The Default curves are valid for the following range of process inlet conditions: dry-bulb temperatures of 1.67C (35F) to 48.9C (120F) and humidity ratios of 0.002857 kgWater/kgDryAir (20 gr/lb) to 0.02857 kgWater/kgDryAir (200 gr/lb).

Regeneration Velocity = (Regeneration Velocity Function of Entering Dry-Bulb and Humidity Ratio Curve) * (Regeneration Velocity Function of Air Velocity Curve)

The UserCurves are limited to the following range of process inlet conditions (essentially not limited): dry-bulb temperatures of 73.3C (-100F) to 65.6C (150F) and humidity ratios of 0.0 kgWater/kgDryAir (0 gr/lb) to 0.21273 kgWater/kgDryAir (1490 gr/lb). If the process inlet conditions are outside this range, the dehumidifier will not operate.

When the Default performance model is selected, the remaining fields are ignored.

\subsection{Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System}\label{dehumidifierdesiccantsystem}

The Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object models the dehumidification of an air stream, normally called the process air stream. A second heated air stream, called the regeneration air stream, is used to remove the collected moisture from the desiccant heat exchanger and this moisture-laden air is then usually exhausted from the building. This Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object is similar to the \hyperref[dehumidifierdesiccantnofans]{Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans} object but has some additional modeling capabilities.

The Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object in EnergyPlus is a compound object that can be placed anywhere in an air loop (\hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC}). Common locations for this object are in an \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystem]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem} or in the main air loop (\hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC}) downstream of a cooling coil (postcooling desiccant dehumidifier). This compound object coordinates the operation of several children objects: a desiccant heat exchanger, a regeneration air fan, and an optional regeneration air heater. Gas, Electric, Steam, or Hot Water heating coils can be used for regenerator air heaters. If this dehumidifier is placed in the main air loop immediately downstream of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, then the dehumidifier's operation can be coordinated with the operation of the companion DX coil and it is also possible to specify that the DX system's condenser waste heat can be used to help regenerate the desiccant heat exchanger. For the case of condenser waste heat regeneration, an optional exhaust fan can also be modeled by this desiccant dehumidifier compound object to help maintain a set point temperature for air entering the regeneration side of the desiccant heat exchanger.

It is important to note that the optional exhaust air fan is modeled internal to the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System and a separate fan object should \emph{not} be added to the input data file (idf) for this fan. On the other hand, a separate fan object \emph{is} required in the input data file for the regeneration air fan.

\end{figure}

A schematic of the compound object Dehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemis shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system} with the draw through regeneration air fan placement. Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system-001} shows the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object configured with the blow through regeneration air fan placement.

NOTE: As with any air loop compound object, the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object itself is specified on the \hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC} Branch or in the \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystemequipmentlist]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} for an \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystem]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}. The children objects (e.g., desiccant heat exchanger, regeneration air fan, and optional regeneration air heater) must be specified separately in the input data file and their inlet/outlet connections must be as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system} or Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system-001}.

\end{figure}

Currently the only heat exchanger choice for this object is HeatExchanger:Desiccant: BalancedFlow. So to model a Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System located in an air loop, the input data file should include the following objects:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System (in an air loop (\hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC}) Branch or \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystemequipmentlist]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} for an \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystem]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem})
\item
  \hyperref[heatexchangerdesiccantbalancedflow]{HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow} (desiccant heat exchanger child object)
\item
  \hyperref[heatexchangerdesiccantbalancedflowperformancedatatype1]{HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1} (desiccant heat exchanger data object)
\item
  \hyperref[zonecontrolhumidistat]{ZoneControl:Humidistat}, and one of:
\item
  \hyperref[setpointmanagersinglezonehumiditymaximum]{SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum}
\item
  \hyperref[setpointmanagermultizonehumiditymaximum]{SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum}
\item
  \hyperref[setpointmanagermultizonemaximumhumidityaverage]{SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average}
\item
  (when in an air loop (\hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC}) Branch), and \hyperref[setpointmanageroutdoorairpretreat]{SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat} (when in an \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystem]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}) to place a maximum humidity ratio set point on the sensor node, typically the process air outlet node
\item
  \hyperref[fansystemmodel]{Fan:SystemModel}, \hyperref[fanonoff]{Fan:OnOff}, or \hyperref[fanconstantvolume]{Fan:ConstantVolume} (regeneration air fan)
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingelectric]{Coil:Heating:Electric} or \hyperref[coilheatinggas-000]{Coil:Heating:Fuel} (optional regeneration air heater)
\item
  \hyperref[coilcoolingdxsinglespeed]{Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}, \hyperref[coilcoolingdxvariablespeed]{Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}, or \hyperref[coilcoolingdxtwostagewithhumiditycontrolmode]{Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode} (optional companion cooling coil)
\end{itemize}

If the user wants to model the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System in an \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystem]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}, then the process air path of the dehumidifier should be located in the outdoor air stream and the regeneration air path may be placed in the relief air stream or modeled by the desiccant dehumidifier itself where the first node for the regeneration inlet air stream must be an outdoor air node. If the user wants to model the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System in an air loop (\hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC}) Branch, then the process air path of the dehumidifier should be located in the air loop Branch object. For this case, the regeneration air stream is modeled by the desiccant dehumidifier object itself (i.e., not part of an air loop Branch statement) and the first node for the regeneration inlet air stream must be an outdoor air node (ref. Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system} or Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system-001}).

A description of each input field for this object is provided below:

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-010}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-009}

A unique, user-assigned name for a particular Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System. Any reference to this dehumidifier by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-1-002}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the dehumidifier can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the dehumidifier can operate. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the dehumidifier will not operate (i.e., no heat exchange will take place and the regeneration air fan does not operate). If the field is blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods. For the case where companion cooling coil regeneration air heating has been specified, the desiccant dehumidifier's exhaust fan serves as the condenser air fan for the cooling coil system so this availability schedule will not disable exhaust fan operation.

\paragraph{Field: Desiccant Heat Exchanger Object Type}\label{field-desiccant-heat-exchanger-object-type}

This alpha field contains the type of desiccant heat exchanger used with this dehumidifier. Currently, the only valid choice is \hyperref[heatexchangerdesiccantbalancedflow]{HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow}.

\paragraph{Field: Desiccant Heat Exchanger Name}\label{field-desiccant-heat-exchanger-name}

This alpha field contains the name of the desiccant heat exchanger used with this dehumidifier.

\paragraph{Field: Sensor Node Name}\label{field-sensor-node-name-000}

This alpha field specifies the name of the air loop node used to control desiccant heat exchanger operation. A set point manager must be used to place a maximum humidity ratio set point on this node (e.g., \hyperref[setpointmanagersinglezonehumiditymaximum]{SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum} or \hyperref[setpointmanageroutdoorairpretreat]{SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat}).

\paragraph{Field: Regeneration Air Fan Object Type}\label{field-regeneration-air-fan-object-type}

This alpha field contains the type of regeneration air fan used. Available fan types are \hyperref[fansystemmodel]{Fan:SystemModel}, \hyperref[fanonoff]{Fan:OnOff} and \hyperref[fanconstantvolume]{Fan:ConstantVolume}.

\paragraph{Field: Regeneration Air Fan Name}\label{field-regeneration-air-fan-name}

This alpha field contains the name of the regeneration air fan used with this dehumidifier.

\paragraph{Field: Regeneration Air Fan Placement}\label{field-regeneration-air-fan-placement}

This alpha field specifies the fan configuration used in the desiccant dehumidifier. Valid choices are BlowThrough and DrawThrough , with a default of DrawThrough if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Regeneration Air Heater Object Type}\label{field-regeneration-air-heater-object-type}

This alpha field contains the type of heating coil used to heat the regeneration air stream. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the regeneration air heating coil does not require additional controller or \hyperref[controllerwatercoil]{Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. For autosizing regeneration air heating coil the \emph{Design Coil Inlet Air Condition} used is the outdoor air condition if the desiccant system is on the primary air loop, or else if the desiccant system is on outdoor air system then it is the return air condition. The \emph{Design Coil Outlet Air Temperature} is the \emph{Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature} specified in the input field below. Valid heating coil choices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingelectric]{Coil:Heating:Electric}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatinggas-000]{Coil:Heating:Fuel}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingwater]{Coil:Heating:Water}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingsteam]{Coil:Heating:Steam}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Regeneration Air Heater Name}\label{field-regeneration-air-heater-name}

This alpha field contains the name of the heating coil used to heat the regeneration air stream. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required.

\paragraph{Field: Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-regeneration-inlet-air-setpoint-temperature}

This optional numeric field specifies the regeneration air inlet temperature setpoint in Celsius. The regeneration air heater and/or the companion coil regeneration air heating will be controlled to this temperature to the extent possible. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required or when control of the exhaust fan used with the companion coil regeneration air heating option is not required. If regeneration air heating coils is autosized, then the value of this input field is used as the \emph{Regeneration Air Heater Design Outlet Air Temperature} for the coil sizing calculation. The default value is 46.0 degrees.

\paragraph{Field: Companion Cooling Coil Object Type}\label{field-companion-cooling-coil-object-type}

This optional alpha field contains the type of companion cooling coil used with this desiccant dehumidifier. The only valid choices are \hyperref[coilcoolingdxsinglespeed]{Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}, \hyperref[coilcoolingdxvariablespeed]{Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}, and \hyperref[coilcoolingdxtwostagewithhumiditycontrolmode]{Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}.

\paragraph{Field: Companion Cooling Coil Name}\label{field-companion-cooling-coil-name}

This optional alpha field contains the name of the companion cooling coil used with this desiccant dehumidifier. This field may be left blank when no companion cooling coil is being modeled.

\paragraph{Field: Companion Cooling Coil Upstream of Dehumidifier Process Inlet}\label{field-companion-cooling-coil-upstream-of-dehumidifier-process-inlet}

This choice field specifies if the companion cooling coil is located immediately upstream of the dehumidifiers process inlet. Valid choices are Yes and No. If Yes is selected, then the outlet air node for the companion cooling coil must be the same as the dehumidifier's process air inlet node (i.e., the process air inlet node name for the desiccant heat exchanger specified for this desiccant dehumidifier). For this case, the companion cooling coil and the desiccant dehumidifier are assumed to operate in tandem ; that is, if the simulation determines that the companion cooling coil is unable to meet the humidity set point specified on the sensor node based on its own operation, then the desiccant dehumidifier operates at the same time and for the same duration as the cooling coil to provide improved dehumidification. If No is selected, then the dehumidifier will control to the humidity set point specified on the sensor node to the extent possible. The default value is No if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating}\label{field-companion-coil-regeneration-air-heating}

This choice field determines if the companion cooling coil's condenser waste heat is used to heat the regeneration inlet air. Valid choices are Yes and No. The default value is No if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate}\label{field-exhaust-fan-maximum-flow-rate}

This optional numeric field contains the maximum fan volumetric flow rate for the exhaust fan in cubic meters per second. As noted previously, this exhaust fan is modeled internally by the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object and a separate fan object should NOT be specified in the input data file for this fan. This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is specified and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Power and the Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name input fields. The model assumes that the exhaust fan will operate as needed to maintain the Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature , up to the maximum flow rate specified in this input field. If the desiccant dehumidifier is OFF for a simulation timestep but its companion cooling coil is operating and is specified to provide regeneration air heating, then the exhaust fan operates at this maximum air flow rate (i.e., this fan serves as the condenser fan for the companion cooling coil system when regeneration air heating is specified, so the inputs to the companion cooling coil object should not include the condenser fan energy since the condenser fan energy is modeled by the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object).

\paragraph{Field: Exhaust Fan Maximum Power}\label{field-exhaust-fan-maximum-power}

This optional numeric field contains the maximum power for the exhaust fan in Watts (i.e., at the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate). This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is used and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate and the Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name input fields.

\paragraph{Field: Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name}\label{field-exhaust-fan-power-curve-name}

This optional alpha field contains the name of the exhaust fan power modifier curve. This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is used and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate and the Exhaust Fan Maximum Power input fields. If this field is blank, the exhaust fan operates (when required) at the maximum power specified in the field above. The curve object type for this Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name must be \hyperref[curvecubic]{Curve:Cubic} or \hyperref[curvequadratic]{Curve:Quadratic}. The curve object (\hyperref[curvecubic]{Curve:Cubic} or \hyperref[curvequadratic]{Curve:Quadratic}) defines the change in exhaust fan power as a function of the ratio of the actual exhaust air flow rate divided by the maximum flow rate.
