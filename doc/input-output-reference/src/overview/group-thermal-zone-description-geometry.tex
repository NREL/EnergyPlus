\section{Group -- Thermal Zone Description/Geometry}\label{group-thermal-zone-descriptiongeometry}

Without spaces, thermal zones, and surfaces, the building can't be simulated. This group of objects (Space, Zone, BuildingSurface) describes the thermal zone characteristics as well as the details of each surface to be modeled. Included here are shading surfaces.

\subsection{Space}\label{space}

This object defines a space (or room) in the building. All Spaces are part of a \hyperref[zone]{Zone}.
Every Zone contains one or more spaces.

Space is an optional input. If a Zone has no Space(s) specified in the input then a default Space named \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{} will be created.
If some surfaces in a Zone are assigned to a Space and some are not, then a default Space
named \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{}-Remainder will be created. 
Input references to Space Names must have a matching Space object. 
Default space names may not be referenced in the input except for \hyperref[outputvariable]{Output:Variable} keys).

Space geometry is specified by attaching surfaces to a space using the ``Space Name'' field. If a Space has only floor surface(s) assigned to it, the Space is assumed to share the same enclosure with other such Spaces in the same Zone (and with any surfaces that are not explicitly assinged to a space). If a Space also has other types of surfaces (non-floor) then the Space forms its own enclosure unless it is connected to other spaces with air boundaries (see \hyperref[constructionairboundary]{Construction:AirBoundary}).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{space-inputs-048}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{space-object-name}

The name of the Space object. Must be unique across Zone and Space names.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{space-zone-name}

The name of the \hyperref[zone]{Zone} this Space is a part of. This field is required.

\paragraph{Field: Floor Area}\label{space-field-floor-area}

Space floor area is used in many places within EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus automatically calculates the space floor area (\SI{}{\area}) from the space geometry given by the surfaces that belong to the space. If this field is 0.0, negative or \textbf{autocalculate} (the default), then the calculated space floor area will be used in subsequent calculations. If this field is positive, then it will be used as the space floor area. If this number differs significantly from the calculated space floor area a warning message will be issued.

\paragraph{Field: Space Type}\label{space-type}

Space type is used to categorize spaces by activity type, such as office, classroom, storage, etc. There is no predefined list of space types; 
any valid input string may be used. Several table outputs include a subtable by Space Type. There are also SpaceType \hyperref[outputmeter-and-outputmetermeterfileonly]{Output:Meters}. See the meter details (mtd) output file for a list of all available meters for a given simulation.
If left blank, this field defaults to ``General'''.
 
\paragraph{Field: Tag \textless{}\#\textgreater{}}\label{field-space-tag}

Tags are used to group spaces by additional characteristics that may be more or less detailed than Space Type. For example, codes and standards designations for ventilation or occupancy may use specific terms that are different from one standard to the next. There is no predefined list of tags; 
any valid input string may be used. Several table outputs include a subtable by Space Tag.


\subsection{SpaceList}\label{spacelist}

The SpaceList object defines a list of Space objects. It is primarily used with \hyperref[group-internal-gains-people-lights-other-internal-zone-equipment]{Internal Gains} objects (People, Lights, etc.) to apply the same gain across a group of Spaces.

Space lists are not exclusive. A Space can be referenced by more than one SpaceList object.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-045space}

\paragraph{Field: Space List Name}\label{field-space-list-name-000}

The name of the SpaceList object. Must be unique across SpaceLists and Spaces.

\paragraph{Field: Space \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-space-name}

Reference to a Space object.

\begin{lstlisting}

SpaceList,
  Mid Floor List,   !- Name
  Mid West Space,   !- Space 1 Name
  Mid Center Space, !- Space 2 Name
  Mid East Space;   !- Space 3 Name
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Zone}\label{zone}

This element sets up the parameters to simulate each thermal zone of the building.
This object defines a thermal zone of the building. Every Zone contains one or more \hyperref[space]{Spaces}.

Space is an optional input. If a Zone has no Space(s) specified in the input then a default Space named \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{} will be created.
If some surfaces in a Zone are assigned to a Space and some are not, then a default Space
named \textless{}Zone Name\textgreater{}-Remainder will be created. 
Input references to Space Names must have a matching Space object. 
Default space names may not be referenced in the input except for \hyperref[outputvariable]{Output:Variable} keys).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-048}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{zone-object-name}

The name of the Zone object. Must be unique across Zone and Space names.

\paragraph{Field: Direction of Relative North}\label{field-direction-of-relative-north}

The Zone North Axis is specified \textbf{relative to the Building North Axis}. This value is specified in degrees (clockwise is positive). For more information, see the figure below as well as the description under ``\hyperref[globalgeometryrules]{GlobalGeometryRules}''.

\paragraph{Field(s): (X,Y,Z) Origin}\label{fields-xyz-origin}

The X,Y,Z coordinates of a zone origin can be specified, for convenience in vertice entry. Depending on the values in ``\hyperref[globalgeometryrules]{GlobalGeometryRules}'' (see description later in this section), these will be used to completely specify the building coordinates in ``world coordinate'' or not. Zone Origin coordinates are specified \textbf{relative to the Building Origin (which always 0,0,0)}. The following figure illustrates the use of Zone North Axis as well as Zone Origin values.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 27

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image053.png}
\caption{Illustration of Zone North Axis and Origins \protect \label{fig:illustration-of-zone-north-axis-and-origins}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Field: Type}\label{field-type-000}

Zone type is currently unused.

\paragraph{Field: Multiplier}\label{field-multiplier}

Zone Multiplier is designed as a ``multiplier'' for floor area, zone loads, and energy consumed by internal gains. It takes the calculated load for the zone and multiplies it, sending the multiplied load to the attached HVAC system. The HVAC system size is specified to meet the entire multiplied zone load and will report the amount of the load met in the Zone Air System Sensible Heating or Cooling Energy/Rate output variable. Autosizing automatically accounts for multipliers. Metered energy consumption by internal gains objects such as Lights or Electric Equipment will be multiplied. The default is 1.

\paragraph{Field: Ceiling Height}\label{field-ceiling-height}

Zone ceiling height is used in several areas within EnergyPlus (such as various room models, some convection coefficient calculations and, primarily, in calculating zone volume in the absence of other parameters). Energyplus automatically calculates the zone ceiling height (m) from the average height of the zone. If this field is 0.0, negative or \textbf{autocalculate}, then the calculated zone ceiling height will be used in subsequent calculations. If this field is positive, then the calculated zone ceiling height will not be used -- the number entered here will be used as the zone ceiling height. If this number differs significantly from the calculated ceiling height, then a warning message will be issued. If a zone ceiling height is entered, but no Volume is entered, then the floor area (if there is one) times the zone ceiling height will be used as the volume.

Note that the Zone Ceiling Height is the distance from the Floor to the Ceiling in the Zone, not an absolute height from the ground.

\paragraph{Field: Volume}\label{field-volume}

Zone volume is used in several areas within EnergyPlus (such as calculating air change rates for reporting or flow when air change rates are chosen as input, daylighting calculations, some convection coefficient calculations). EnergyPlus automatically calculates the zone volume (\SI{}{\volume}) from the zone geometry given by the surfaces that belong to the zone. If this field is 0.0, negative or \textbf{autocalculate}, then the calculated zone volume will be used in subsequent calculations. If this field is positive, then it will be used as the zone volume. If this number differs significantly from the calculated zone volume a warning message will be issued. For autocalculate to work properly, the zone must be enclosed by the entered walls. Note that indicating the volume to be calculated but entering a positive ceiling height in the previous field will cause the volume to be calculated as the floor area (if \textgreater{} 0) times the entered ceiling height; else the volume will be calculated from the described surfaces. If this field is positive, any ceiling height positive value will not be used in volume calculations.

\paragraph{Field: Floor Area}\label{field-floor-area}

Zone floor area is used in many places within EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus automatically calculates the zone floor area (\SI{}{\area}) from the zone geometry given by the surfaces that belong to the zone. If this field is 0.0, negative or \textbf{autocalculate}, then the calculated zone floor area will be used in subsequent calculations. If this field is positive, then it will be used as the zone floor area. If this number differs significantly from the calculated zone floor area a warning message will be issued.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Inside Convection Algorithm}\label{field-zone-inside-convection-algorithm}

The Zone Inside Convection Algorithm field is optional. This field specifies the convection model to be used for the inside face of heat transfer surfaces associated with this zone. The choices are: \textbf{Simple} (constant natural convection - ASHRAE), \textbf{TARP} (combines natural and wind-driven convection correlations from laboratory measurements on flat plates), \textbf{CeilingDiffuser} (ACH based forced and mixed convection correlations for ceiling diffuser configuration with simple natural convection limit), \textbf{AdaptiveConvectionAlgorithm} (complex arrangement of various models that adapt to various zone conditions and can be customized), \textbf{TrombeWall} (variable natural convection in an enclosed rectangular cavity), and \textbf{ASTMC1340} (mixed convection coefficients specified for attic zone). See the Inside Convection Algorithm object for further descriptions of the available models.

If omitted or blank, the algorithm specified in the \hyperref[surfaceconvectionalgorithminside]{SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Inside} object is the default.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Outside Convection Algorithm}\label{field-zone-outside-convection-algorithm}

The Zone Outside Convection Algorithm field is optional. This field specifies the convection model to be used for the outside face of heat transfer surfaces associated with this zone. The choices are: \textbf{SimpleCombined}, \textbf{TARP}, \textbf{DOE-2}, \textbf{MoWiTT, and AdaptiveConvectionAlgorithm}. The simple convection model applies heat transfer coefficients depending on the roughness and windspeed. This is a combined heat transfer coefficient that includes radiation to sky, ground, and air. The correlation is based on Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-the-energyplus-unitary-system}, Page 25.1 (Thermal and Water Vapor Transmission Data), 2001 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals.

The other convection models apply heat transfer coefficients depending on the roughness, windspeed, and terrain of the building's location. These are \emph{convection only} heat transfer coefficients; radiation heat transfer coefficients are calculated automatically by the program. The TARP algorithm was developed for the TARP software and combines natural and wind-driven convection correlations from laboratory measurements on flat plates. The DOE-2 and MoWiTT were derived from field measurements. The AdaptiveConvectionAlgorithm model is an dynamic algorithm that organizes a large number of different convection models and automatically selects the one that best applies. The adaptive convection algorithm can also be customized using the \hyperref[surfaceconvectionalgorithmoutsideadaptivemodelselections]{SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Outside:AdaptiveModelSelections} input object. All algorithms are described more fully in the Engineering Reference.

If omitted or blank, the algorithm specified in the \hyperref[surfaceconvectionalgorithmoutside]{SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Outside} object is the default.

\paragraph{Field: Part of Total Floor Area}\label{field-part-of-total-floor-area}

This optional field defaults to Yes if not specified. The field is used to show when a zone is not part of the Total Floor Area as shown in the Annual Building Utility Performance Summary tables. Specifically, when No is specified, the area is excluded from both the conditioned floor area and the total floor area in the Building Area sub table and the Normalized Metrics sub tables.

And, an IDF example:

\end{itemize}

Two of these are of particular interest:

\begin{lstlisting}
Zone,Average,Zone Mean Air Temperature [C]
HVAC,Average,Zone Air Temperature [C]
\end{lstlisting}

These two variable outputs are/should be identical. However, note that they can be reported at different time intervals. ``Zone Mean Air Temperature'' is only available on the Zone/HB timestep (Number of Timesteps per Hour) whereas ``Zone Air Temperature'' can be reported at the HVAC timestep (which can vary).

\subsubsection{Zone Mean Air Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-mean-air-temperature-c}

From the code definition, the zone mean air temperature is the average temperature of the air temperatures at the system timestep. Remember that the zone heat balance represents a ``well stirred'' model for a zone, therefore there is only one mean air temperature to represent the air temperature for the zone.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-air-temperature-c}

This is very similar to the mean air temperature in the last field. The ``well stirred'' model for the zone is the basis, but this temperature is also available at the ``detailed'' system timestep.

\subsubsection{Zone Mean Air Dewpoint Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-mean-air-dewpoint-temperature-c}

This is the dewpoint temperature of the zone calculated from the Zone Mean Air Temperature (above), the Zone Air Humidity Ratio (below) and the outdoor barometric pressure.

\subsubsection{Zone Thermostat Air Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-thermostat-air-temperature-c}

This is the zone air node temperature for the well-mixed room air model, which is the default room air model type (\hyperref[roomairmodeltype]{RoomAirModelType} = Mixing). But for other types of Room Air Model (the RoomAir:TemperaturePattern:* and RoomAirSettings:* objects) the zone thermostat air temperature may depend on the Thermostat Height and Thermostat Offset.

\subsubsection{Zone Mean Radiant Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-mean-radiant-temperature-c}

The Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) in degrees Celsius of a space is a measure of the combined effects of temperatures of surfaces within that space. Specifically it is the surface area × emissivity weighted average of the zone inside surface temperatures (ref. Surface Inside Temperature), where emissivity is the Thermal Absorptance of the inside material layer of each surface.

\subsubsection{Zone Operative Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-operative-temperature-c}

Zone Operative Temperature (OT) is the average of the Zone Mean Air Temperature (MAT) and Zone Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), OT = 0.5*MAT + 0.5*MRT. This output variable is not affected by the type of thermostat controls in the zone, and does not include the direct effect of high temperature radiant systems. See also Zone Thermostat Operative Temperature.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Heat Balance Internal Convective Heat Gain Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-heat-balance-internal-convective-heat-gain-rate-w}

The Zone Air Heat Balance Internal Convective Heat Gain Rate is the sum, in watts, of heat transferred to the zone air from all types of internal gains, including people, lights, equipment etc. This and the following provide results on the load components of the zone air heat balance. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-heat-balance-surface-convection-rate-w}

The Zone Air Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate is the sum, in watts, of heat transferred to the zone air from all the surfaces. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Heat Balance Interzone Air Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-heat-balance-interzone-air-transfer-rate-w}

The Zone Air Heat Balance Interzone Air Transfer Rate is the sum, in watts, of heat transferred to the zone air from all the transfers of air from other thermal zones. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Heat Balance Outdoor Air Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-heat-balance-outdoor-air-transfer-rate-w}

The Zone Air Heat Balance Outdoor Air Transfer Rate is the sum, in watts, of heat transferred to the zone air from all the transfers of air from the out side, such as infiltration. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Heat Balance System Air Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-heat-balance-system-air-transfer-rate-w}

The Zone Air Heat Balance System Air Transfer Rate is the sum, in watts, of heat transferred to the zone air by HVAC forced-air systems and air terminal units. Such HVAC systems are connected to the zone by an inlet node (see \hyperref[zonehvacequipmentconnections]{ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} input field called Zone Air Inlet Node or Node List Name) This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers. The Zone Air Heat Balance System Air Transfer Rate may not agree exactly with the equipment-level delivered energy transfer rate when the zone temperature is changing significantly over a timestep (e.g. during thermostat setback and setup), but the energy will balance out over time.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Heat Balance System Convective Heat Gain Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-heat-balance-system-convective-heat-gain-rate-w}

The Zone Air Heat Balance System Convective Heat Gain Rate is the sum, in watts, of heat transferred directly to the zone air by ``non-air'' HVAC systems. Such HVAC systems are not connected to the zone by an inlet node but rather add or subtract heat directly to the zone air in a manner similar to internal gains. These include the convective fraction of zone HVAC baseboards and high temperature radiant systems, zone HVAC refrigeration chiller set, and the extra convective cooling provided by the cooled beam air terminal unit. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Heat Balance Air Energy Storage Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-heat-balance-air-energy-storage-rate-w}

The Zone Air Heat Balance Air Energy Storage Rate is the heat stored, in watts, in the zone air as result of zone air temperature changing from one timestep to the next. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Heat Balance Deviation Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-heat-balance-deviation-rate-w}

The Zone Air Heat Balance Deviation Rate is the imbalance, in watts, in the energy balance for zone air. The value should be near zero but will become non-zero if zone conditions are changing rapidly or erratically. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers. (This output variable is only generated if the user has set a computer system environment variable DisplayAdvancedReportVariables equal to ``yes''.)

\subsubsection{Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-air-system-sensible-heating-energy-j}

This output variable represents the sensible heating energy in Joules that is actually supplied by the system to that zone for the timestep reported. This is the sensible heating rate multiplied by the simulation timestep. This is calculated and reported from the Correct step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\begin{callout}
Zone Air System Sensible Heating (and Cooling) Energy (and Rate) all report the heating or cooling delivered by the HVAC system to a zone. These values are calculated by multiplying the supply air mass flow rate by the difference between the supply air temperature and the zone air temperature. This does not always indicate the operation of heating or cooling coils. For example, cooling will be reported if the supply air is cooled due to the introduction of outside air, even if all coils are off.

In addition, certain "non-air" zone-based systems will also add their heating or cooling contribution to this output variable.  For example, the following zone equipment will also add their output to the appropriate heating or cooling energy/rate output variable:

\begin{itemize}
\item
ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:RadiantConvective:Water
\item
ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:RadiantConvective:Steam
\item
ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:RadiantConvective:Electric
\item
ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:Convective:Water
\item
ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:Convective:Electric
\item
ZoneHVAC:CoolingPanel:RadiantConvective:Water
\item
ZoneHVAC:RefrigerationChillerSet
\end{itemize}

This means that system output from equipment such as high and low temperature radiant systems are NOT included in this output variable as the control of these radiant systems are handled separately with their own unique controls.

Finally, note that these variables are calculated at the system timestep. When reported at the ``detailed'' reporting frequency, these variables will never show heating and cooling both in the same system timestep. If reported at a frequency less than ``Detailed'' (for example, Hourly) values may appear in both the heating and cooling variable for the same hour if the system cooled the zone for part of the reporting period and heated the zone for another part of the reporting period.
\end{callout}

\subsubsection{Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-air-system-sensible-cooling-energy-j}

This output variable represents the sensible cooling energy in Joules that is actually supplied by the system to that zone for the timestep reported. This is the sensible cooling rate multiplied by the simulation timestep. This is calculated and reported from the Correct step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers. For additional information on this output variable, see the note that accompanies the Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy output variable above.

\subsubsection{Zone Air System Sensible Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-system-sensible-heating-rate-w}

This output variable represents the sensible heating rate in Watts that is actually supplied by the system to that zone for the timestep reported. This is calculated and reported from the Correct step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers. For additional information on this output variable, see the note that accompanies the Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy output variable above.

\subsubsection{Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-system-sensible-cooling-rate-w}

This output variable represents the sensible cooling rate in Watts that is actually supplied by the system to that zone for the timestep reported. This is calculated and reported from the Correct step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers. For additional information on this output variable, see the note that accompanies the Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy output variable above.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Humidity Ratio {[}kgWater/kgDryAir{]}}\label{zone-air-humidity-ratio-kgwaterkgdryair}

This output variable represents the air humidity ratio after the correct step for each zone. The humidity ratio is the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air contained in the zone in (kg water/kg air) and is unitless.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Relative Humidity {[}\%{]}}\label{zone-air-relative-humidity}

This output variable represents the air relative humidity after the correct step for each zone. The relative humidity is in percent and uses the Zone Air Temperature, the Zone Air Humidity Ratio and the Outside Barometric Pressure for calculation.

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Radiant Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-radiant-heating-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Radiant Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-radiant-heating-energy-j}

These output variables represent the sum of radiant gains from specific internal sources (e.g.~equipment) throughout the space or zone in Watts (for rate) or joules. This includes radiant gain from \hyperref[people]{People}, Lights, Electric Equipment, Gas Equipment, Other Equipment, Hot Water Equipment, and Steam Equipment.

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Visible Radiation Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-visible-radiation-heating-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Visible Radiation Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-visible-radiation-heating-energy-j}

These output variables expresse the sum of heat gain in Watts (for rate) or joules that is the calculated short wavelength radiation gain from lights in the space or zones. This calculation uses the total energy from lights and the fraction visible to realize this value, summed over the space or zones in the simulation.

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Convective Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-convective-heating-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Convective Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-convective-heating-energy-j}

These output variables represent the sum of convective gains from specific sources (e.g.~equipment) throughout the space or zone in Watts (for rate) or joules. This includes convective gain from \hyperref[people]{People}, Lights, Electric Equipment, Gas Equipment, Other Equipment, Hot Water Equipment, and Steam Equipment.

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Latent Gain Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-latent-gain-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Latent Gain Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-latent-gain-energy-j}

These output variables represent the sum of latent gains from specific internal sources (e.g.~equipment) throughout the space or zone in Watts (for rate) or joules. This includes latent gain from \hyperref[people]{People}, Electric Equipment, Gas Equipment, Other Equipment, Hot Water Equipment, and Steam Equipment.

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Total Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-total-heating-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Space or Zone Total Internal Total Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-total-heating-energy-j}

These output variables represent the sum of all heat gains throughout the space or zone in Watts (for rate) or joules. This includes all heat gains from \hyperref[people]{People}, Lights, Electric Equipment, Gas Equipment, Other Equipment, Hot Water Equipment, and Steam Equipment.

\subsubsection{Zone Exfiltration Heat Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-exfiltration-heat-transfer-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Zone Exfiltration Latent Heat Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-exfiltration-latent-heat-transfer-rate-w}

These output variables represent the heat emitted to ambient from exfiltration in Watts. The exfiltration rate is calculated by solving a mass flow balance on the zone including infiltration, ventilation, outdoor air mixing, zone-to-zone mixing, and all of the zone inlet, exhaust, and return nodes. The latent parts are determined by taking the difference between the total and the sensible rate. Positive values indicate the zone injects heat to the environment, while negative values indicate the building extracts heat from the environment. 

\subsubsection{Zone Exhaust Air Heat Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-exhaust-heat-transfer-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Zone Exhaust Air Sensible Heat Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-exhaust-sensible-heat-transfer-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Zone Exhaust Air Latent Heat Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-exhaust-latent-heat-transfer-rate-w}

These output variables represent the heat emitted to ambient from exhaust air in Watts. The zone exhaust air flow rate is aggregated from the zone exhaust nodes. Positive values indicate the building injects heat to the environment, while negative values indicate the building extracts heat from the environment. 

\subsubsection{Site Total Zone Exfiltration Heat Loss {[}W{]}}\label{site-total-exfiltration-heat-transfer-rate-w}

These output variables represent the total amount of heat emitted to ambient from all zones by exfiltration in Watts. Positive values indicate the building injects heat to the environment, while negative values indicate the building extracts heat from the environment. This includes both sensible and latent heat loss from zone exfiltration.

\subsubsection{Site Total Zone Exhaust Air Heat Loss {[}W{]}}\label{site-total-exhaust-heat-transfer-rate-w}

These output variables represent the total amount of heat emitted to ambient from all zones by exhaust air in Watts.

This includes both sensible and latent heat loss from zone exhaust air.

\subsection{ZoneList}\label{zonelist}

The ZoneList object defines a list of Zone objects. It is primarily used with the \hyperref[zonegroup]{ZoneGroup} object to provide a generalized way for doing ``Floor Multipliers''. (See the \hyperref[zonegroup]{ZoneGroup} description below.) The associated ZoneList output variables also provide a way to aggregate and organize zone loads.

Zone lists are not exclusive. A zone can be referenced be more than one ZoneList object.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-045}

\paragraph{Field: Zone List Name}\label{field-zone-list-name-000}

The name of the ZoneList object. Must be unique across ZoneLists.

\paragraph{Field: Zone \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-zone-1---zone-20-name}

Reference to a Zone object. This object is extensible, so additional fields of this type can be added to the end of this object.

\begin{lstlisting}

ZoneList,
  Mid Floor List,  !- Name
  Mid West Zone,   !- Zone 1 Name
  Mid Center Zone, !- Zone 2 Name
  Mid East Zone;   !- Zone 3 Name
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-1-028}

The following output variables are reported by the ZoneList object:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Zone List Sensible Heating Rate {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Zone List Sensible Cooling Rate {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Zone List Sensible Heating Energy {[}J{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Zone List Sensible Cooling Energy {[}J{]}
\end{itemize}

All ZoneList variables are the sum of the corresponding Zone variables. \emph{Zone Multiplier} fields in the Zone objects are also taken into account.

\subsection{ZoneGroup}\label{zonegroup}

The ZoneGroup object adds a multiplier to a \hyperref[zonelist]{ZoneList}. This can be used to reduce the amount of input necessary for simulating repetitive structures, such as the identical floors of a multi-story building. To create a ``Floor Multiplier'', use the \hyperref[zonelist]{ZoneList} object to organize several zones into a typical floor. Then use the \emph{Zone List Multiplier} field in the ZoneGroup object to multiply the system load for the zones in the list will also be multiplied. Zones with a \emph{Multiplier} field greater than one in the Zone object are effectively double-multiplied.

\begin{callout}
NOTE: Although \hyperref[zonelist]{ZoneList}s are not exclusive by themselves, \hyperref[zonelist]{ZoneList}s used to form a ZoneGroup are exclusive; the \hyperref[zonelist]{ZoneList}s used with a ZoneGroup must not have any zones in common.
\end{callout}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-042}

\paragraph{Tips for Multi-Story Simulations:}\label{tips-for-multi-story-simulations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For floors that are multiplied, connect exterior boundary conditions of the floor to the ceiling and vice versa.
\item
  Since exterior convection coefficients vary with elevation, locate the typical middle floor zones mid-height between the lowest and highest middle floors to be modeled.
\item
  Shading must be identical for all multiplied floors or less accurate results may be obtained by using the zone list multiplier.
\end{itemize}

ZoneGroup and \hyperref[zonelist]{ZoneList} can also be used to simulate other repetitive cases, such as clusters of zones on the ground.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Group Name}\label{field-zone-group-name}

The name of the ZoneGroup object. This must be unique across ZoneGroups.

\paragraph{Field: Zone List Name}\label{field-zone-list-name-1}

Reference to a \hyperref[zonelist]{ZoneList} object. The zones in the list constitute the zones in the group.

\paragraph{Field: Zone List Multiplier}\label{field-zone-list-multiplier}

An integer multiplier. Zone List Multiplier is designed as a ``multiplier'' for floor area, zone loads, and energy consumed by internal gains. It takes the calculated load for the zone and multiplies it, sending the multiplied load to the attached HVAC system. The HVAC system size is specified to meet the entire multiplied zone load and will report the amount of the load met in the Zone Air System Sensible Heating or Cooling Energy/Rate output variable. Autosizing automatically accounts for multipliers. Metered energy consumption by internal gains objects such as Lights or Electric Equipment will be multiplied. The default is 1.

\begin{lstlisting}

ZONE GROUP,
    Mid Floor,  !- Zone Group Name
    Mid Floor List,  !- Zone List Name
    8;  !- Zone List Multiplier
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-2-023}

The following output variables are reported by the ZoneGroup object:

\item
  HVAC,Average,Zone Group Sensible Cooling Rate {[}W{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Zone Group Sensible Heating Energy {[}J{]}
\item
  HVAC,Sum,Zone Group Sensible Cooling Energy {[}J{]}
\end{itemize}

All ZoneGroup variables report the associated ZoneList value multiplied by the \emph{Zone List Multiplier}.

\subsection{Surface(s)}\label{surfaces}

What's a building without surfaces?

EnergyPlus allows for several surface types:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[buildingsurfacedetailed]{BuildingSurface:Detailed}}
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed}}
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Site:Detailed}}
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Building:Detailed}}
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[shadingzonedetailed-000]{Shading:Zone:Detailed}}
\end{itemize}

Each of the preceding surfaces has ``correct'' geometry specifications. BuildingSurface and Fenestration surfaces (heat transfer surfaces) are used to describe the important elements of the building (walls, roofs, floors, windows, doors) that will determine the interactions of the building surfaces with the outside environment parameters and the internal space requirements. These surfaces are also used to represent ``interzone'' heat transfer. All surfaces are modeled as a thin plane (with no thickness) except that material thicknesses are taken into account for heat transfer calculations.

During specification of surfaces, several ``outside'' environments may be chosen:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Ground} -- when the surface is in touch with the ground (e.g.~slab floors)
\item
  \textbf{Outdoors} -- when the surface is an external surface (e.g.~walls, roofs, windows directly exposed to the outdoor conditions)
\item
  \textbf{Surface} -- when the surface is
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      An adiabatic internal zone surface
    \item
      A interzone surface
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Zone --} when the surface is
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      A interzone surface in which the other surface is not put in the input file.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{OtherSideCoefficients} -- when using a custom profile to describe the external conditions of the surface (advanced concept -- covered in subject: \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients})
\item
  \textbf{OtherSideConditionsModel} -- when using specially modeled components, such as active solar systems, that cover the outside surface and modify the conditions it experiences.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Surface} items must also specify an ``outside face object''. This is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Current surface name -- for adiabatic internal surfaces.
\item
  A surface name in another zone -- for interzone heat transfer.
\item
  An ``opposing'' surface name (in the current zone) -- for representing ``middle'' zones.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Zone} items must also specify an ``outside face object''. This is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The zone that contains the other surface that is adjacent to this surface but is not entered in input.
\end{itemize}

\begin{callout}
Note that heat transfer surfaces are fully represented with each description. As stated earlier in the Construction description, materials in the construction (outside to inside) are included but film coefficients neither inside nor outside are used in the description -- these are automatically calculated during the EnergyPlus run. Interzone surfaces which do not have a symmetrical construction (such as a ceiling/floor) require two Construction objects with the layers in reverse order. For example, CEILING with carpet, concrete, ceiling tile and FLOOR with ceiling tile, concrete, carpet. If interzone surfaces have a symmetrical construction, the specification for the two surfaces can reference the same Construction. When a surface is connected as the outside boundary condition for another surface, the two surfaces may be in the same plane, or they may be separated to imply thickness.
\end{callout}

\begin{callout}
Note also that if interzone constructions include either \hyperref[windowmaterialglazing]{WindowMaterial:Glazing} or \hyperref[windowmaterialglazingequivalentlayer]{WindowMaterial:Glazing:EquivalentLayer} then the materials properties of layers consisting of those material types will have front and back side values that may differ from one another.  So, if using such materials in the definition of an interzone construction, reversed materials must also have their front and back properties inverted so as to match in reverse order.  For example, if there is a single layer of glass of type \hyperref[windowmaterialglazing]{WindowMaterial:Glazing} defined for an interzone construction and the front and back properties differ, the user must define two materials with equivalent properties except that the front and back values must be reversed.  This means that one material used for the definition on one side might have a front side solar reflectance at normal incidence of 0.35 and a back side solar reflectance at normal incidence of 0.25.  The material used for the other side of the interzone construction must then have a front side solar reflectance at normal incidence of 0.25 and a back side solar reflectance at normal incidence of 0.35 to match properly in reverse.  EnergyPlus checks for all of the user input properties for single and multiple layer interzone constructions that use these two material types to confirm that this has been done correctly so that the simulation accurately reflects the properties of the materials on each side.
\end{callout}

\textbf{Shading} surfaces are used to describe aspects of the site which do not directly impact the physical interactions of the environmental parameters but may significantly shade the building during specific hours of the day or time so the year (e.g.~trees, bushes, mountains, nearby buildings which aren't being simulated as part of this facility, etc.)

\begin{callout}
Note that surfaces which are part of the simulated building automatically shade other parts of the building as geometry and time of day dictate -- there is no need on the user's part to include surfaces that might be in other zones for shading.
\end{callout}

Another surface type:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[internalmass]{InternalMass}}
\end{itemize}

is used to specify the construction/material parameters and area of items within the space that are important to heat transfer calculations but not necessarily important geometrically. (For example, furniture within the space -- particularly for large spaces). Internal mass can also be used for internal walls that are not needed (when FullInteriorAndExterior Solar Distribution is in effect) for solar distribution or to represent many, if not all, interior walls when solar is distributed to the floors only.

\subsection{Interzone Surfaces}\label{interzone-surfaces}

EnergyPlus can quite accurately simulate the surface heat exchange between two zones. However, this accuracy is not always required and using interzonal heat transfer does add to the complexity of the calculations -- thus requiring more CPU time to simulate. More information about interzonal heat transfer calculations is contained in the Engineering Reference. Some simple guidelines are presented here -- for three cases: adiabatic surfaces, surfaces in ``middle'' zones, and surfaces where heat transfer is ``expected'' (e.g.~between a residence and an unheated, attached garage).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Adiabatic Surfaces -- These surfaces would be represented as common surfaces (between two zones) where both zones are typically the same temperature. Thus, no transfer is expected in the surface from one zone to the next. These surfaces should be described as simply internal surfaces for the zone referencing as their Outside Boundary Condition Object (see later description in individual surface objects) their own surface names.
\item
  Surfaces in Middle Zones -- Middle zones in a building can be simulated using a judicious use of surfaces and zone multipliers to effect the correct ``loads'' for the building. Thus, middle zone behavior can be simulated without modeling the adjacent zones. This is done by specifying a surface within the zone. For example, a middle floor zone can be modeled by making the floor the Outside Boundary Condition Object for the ceiling, and the ceiling the Outside Boundary Condition Object for the floor.
\item
  Surfaces between Zones with differing temperatures -- These zones represent the true use of interzone surfaces. In a residence that has an attached garage, the garage may be unheated/uncooled or at least not conditioned to the same degree as the residence interior. In this case, EnergyPlus can be used to accurately calculate the effects of the differently conditioned space to the other spaces.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Surface View Factors}\label{surface-view-factors}

EnergyPlus uses an area weighted approximation to calculate ``view factors'' between surfaces within a thermal zone. Each surface uses the total area that it can ``see'' among the other surfaces. The approximate view factor from this surface to each other surface is then the area of the receiving surface over the sum of areas that is visible to the sending surface.

In order to account in some limited way for the fact that certain surfaces will not see each other, several assumptions have been built into this simple view factor approximation. First, a surface cannot see itself. Second, surfaces with approximately the same azimuth (facing direction) and tilt (``same'' being within a built in limit) will not see each other. This means that a window will not see the wall that it is placed on, for example. Third, floors cannot see each other. Fourth, if the surface is a floor, ceiling, roof, or internal mass, the rule for the same azimuth and tilt eliminating radiant exchange between surface is waived when the receiving surface is floor, roof, ceiling, or internal mass as long as both surfaces are not floors.

Note that this does not take into account that surfaces may be ``around the corner'' from each other and in reality not see each other at all. Rooms are assumed to be convex rather than concave in this method.

To summarize, using the Surface ``Class'', the approximate view factors have:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  No surface sees itself.
\item
  No Floor sees another floor.
\item
  All other surface types see Internal Mass.
\item
  All other surface types see floors.
\item
  Floors always see ceilings.
\item
  Floors always see roofs.
\item
  All other surfaces whose tilt or facing angle differences are greater than 10 degrees see each other.
\end{enumerate}

If geometry is correct, conditions 1, 3, and 7 should take care of all surfaces, but the other conditions supply common sense when the geometry is incorrect. More information about the EnergyPlus view factor calculation is contained in the Engineering Reference document.

\subsection{GlobalGeometryRules}\label{globalgeometryrules}

Before the surface objects are explained in detail, a description of geometric parameters used in EnergyPlus will be given. Since the input of surface vertices is common to most of the surface types, it will also be given a separate discussion.

Some flexibility is allowed in specifying surface vertices. This flexibility is embodied in the GlobalGeometryRules class/object in the input file. Note that the parameters specified in this statement are used for all surface vertice inputs -- there is no further ``flexibility'' allowed.

In order to perform shadowing calculations, the building surfaces must be specified. EnergyPlus uses a three dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinate system for surface vertex specification. This Right Hand coordinate system has the X-axis pointing east, the Y-axis pointing north, and the Z-axis pointing up. See figure below.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 28
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image054.png}
\caption{EnergyPlus Coordinate System \protect \label{fig:energyplus-coordinate-system}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-3-038}

\paragraph{Field: Starting Vertex Position}\label{field-starting-vertex-position}

The shadowing algorithms in EnergyPlus rely on surfaces having vertices in a certain order and positional structure. Thus, the surface translator needs to know the starting point for each surface entry. The choices are: UpperLeftCorner, LowerLeftCorner , UpperRightCorner, or LowerRightCorner. Since most surfaces will be 4 sided, the convention will specify this position as though each surface were 4 sided. Extrapolate 3 sided figures to this convention. For 5 and more sided figures, again, try to extrapolate the best ``corner'' starting position.

\paragraph{Field: Vertex Entry Direction}\label{field-vertex-entry-direction}

Surfaces are always specified as being viewed from the outside of the zone to which they belong. (Shading surfaces are specified slightly differently and are discussed under the particular types). EnergyPlus needs to know whether the surfaces are being specified in counterclockwise or clockwise order (from the Starting Vertex Position). EnergyPlus uses this to determine the outward facing normal for the surface (which is the \emph{facing angle} of the surface -- very important in shading and shadowing calculations.

\paragraph{Field: Coordinate System}\label{field-coordinate-system}

Vertices can be specified in two ways: using \textbf{World} coordinates, or a \textbf{Relative} coordinate specification. Relative coordinates allow flexibility of rapid change to observe changes in building results due to orientation and position. \textbf{World} coordinates will facilitate use within a CADD system structure.

\textbf{Relative} coordinates make use of both Building and Zone North Axis values as well as Zone Origin values to locate the surface in 3D coordinate space. \textbf{World} coordinates do not use these values.

Typically, all zone origin values for ``World'' coordinates will be (0,0,0) but Building and Zone North Axis values may be used in certain instances (namely the Daylighting Coordinate Location entries).

\paragraph{Field: Daylighting Reference Point Coordinate System}\label{field-daylighting-reference-point-coordinate-system}

Daylighting reference points need to be specified as well. Again, there can be two flavors; \textbf{Relative} and \textbf{World}. Daylighting reference points must fit within the zone boundaries.

\textbf{Relative} coordinates make use of both Building and Zone North Axis values as well as Zone Origin values to locate the reference point in 3D coordinate space. \textbf{World} coordinates do not use these values.

\paragraph{Field: Rectangular Surface Coordinate System}\label{field-rectangular-surface-coordinate-system}

Simple, rectangular surfaces (\hyperref[wallexterior]{Wall:Exterior}, \hyperref[walladiabatic]{Wall:Adiabatic}, \hyperref[wallunderground]{Wall:Underground}, \hyperref[wallinterzone]{Wall:Interzone}, Roof, \hyperref[ceilingadiabatic]{Ceiling:Adiabatic}, \hyperref[ceilinginterzone]{Ceiling:Interzone}, \hyperref[floorgroundcontact]{Floor:GroundContact}, \hyperref[flooradiabatic]{Floor:Adiabatic}, \hyperref[floorinterzone]{Floor:Interzone}) can be specified with their Lower Left Corner as \textbf{relative} or \textbf{world}.

\textbf{Relative} (default) corners are specified relative to the Zone Origin for each surface. \textbf{World} corners would specify the absolute/world coordinate for this corner.

\subsection{Surfaces}\label{surfaces-1}

Surfaces make up the buildings and the elements that shade buildings. There are several methods to inputting surfaces, ranging from simple rectangular surfaces to detailed descriptions that describe each vertex in the order specified in the \hyperref[globalgeometryrules]{GlobalGeometryRules} object. The simple, rectangular surface objects are described first with the more detailed descriptions following.

\subsection{Walls}\label{walls}

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-2-001}

This is the name of the construction (ref: Construction object) used in the surface. Regardless of location in the building, the ``full'' construction (all layers) is used. For example, for an interior wall separating two zones, zone x would have the outside layer (e.g.~drywall) as the material that shows in zone y and then the layers to the inside layer -- the material that shows in zone x. For symmetric constructions, the same construction can be used in the surfaces described in both zones. Note that if the construction is \textbf{\hyperref[constructioncfactorundergroundwall]{Construction:CfactorUndergroundWall}} then the GroundFCfactoreMethod will be used for this wall.

To assign a blind, see \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}. To assign switchable glazing, such as electrochromic glazing, see \hyperref[windowpropertyshadingcontrol]{WindowShadingControl}.


\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-14-016}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-10-018}

This is a unique name associated with the window.

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-10}

This is the name of the subsurface's construction (ref: objects: Construction, \hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile}, \hyperref[constructioncomplexfenestrationstate]{Construction:ComplexFenestrationState}).

For windows, if Construction Name is not found among the constructions on the input (.idf) file, the Window Data File (ref. \hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile} object) will be searched for that Construction Name (see ``Importing Windows from WINDOW''). If that file is not present or if the Construction Name does not match the name of an entry on the file, an error will result.

The calculation of shadowing on the subsurfaces (and the calculation of the interior distribution of beam solar radiation transmitted by windows and glass doors) are done for the specified subsurface position and dimensions.

Multiplier should be used with caution. Multiplier \textgreater{} 1 can give inaccurate or nonsensical results in situations where the results are sensitive to window or glass door position. This includes shadowing on the window/glass door, daylighting from the window/glass door, and interior distribution of solar radiation from the window/glass door. In these cases, the results for the single input window/glass door, after multiplication, may not be representative of the results you would get if you entered each of the multiple subsurfaces separately.

If Multiplier \textgreater{} 1, you will get

--a \emph{warning} if Solar Distribution = FullExterior or FullInteriorAndExterior (ref: Building - Field: Solar Distribution), indicating that the shadowing on the input window or the interior solar radiation distribution from the input window may not be representative of the actual group of windows. No warning is issued if Solar Distribution = MinimalShadowing.

--an \emph{error} if the window is an exterior window/glass door in a zone that has a detailed daylighting calculation (Daylighting:Detailed specified for the zone). Since a single window with a multiplier can never give the same daylight illuminance as the actual set of windows, you are not allowed to use Multiplier in this situation.

In these cases, the results for the single input window/glass door, after multiplication, may not be representative of the results you would get if you entered each of the multiple subsurfaces separately.

If Multiplier \textgreater{} 1, you will get

--a \emph{warning} if Solar Distribution = FullExterior or FullInteriorAndExterior (ref: Building - Field: Solar Distribution), indicating that the shadowing on the input window or the interior solar radiation distribution from the input window may not be representative of the actual group of windows.

This field is the Z coordinate (in meters).

\paragraph{Field: Length}\label{field-length-12}

This field is the length of the door in meters.

\paragraph{Field: Height}\label{field-height-6}

This field is the height of the door in meters.

\subsection{Window:Interzone}\label{windowinterzone}

The Window:Interzone object is used to place windows on surfaces that can have windows, including interzone walls, interzone ceiling/floors. These, of course, can be entered using the simple rectangular objects or the more detailed vertex entry objects.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-17-010}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-13-011}

This is a unique name associated with the window.

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-13}

This is the name of the subsurface's construction (ref: objects: Construction, \hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile}, \hyperref[constructioncomplexfenestrationstate]{Construction:ComplexFenestrationState}).

For windows, if Construction Name is not found among the constructions on the input (.idf) file, the Window Data File (ref. \hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile} object) will be searched for that Construction Name (see ``Importing Windows from WINDOW''). If that file is not present or if the Construction Name does not match the name of an entry on the file, an error will result. If there is a match, a window construction and its corresponding glass and gas materials will be created from the information read from the file.

\paragraph{Field: Building Surface Name}\label{field-building-surface-name-3}

This is the name of a surface that contains this subsurface. Certain kinds of surfaces may not be allowed to have subsurfaces. For example, a surface in contact with the ground (Outside Boundary Condition = Ground) cannot contain a window. The window assumes the outward facing angle as well as the tilt angle of the base surface.

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition Object}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition-object-3}

The Outside Boundary Condition Object field is the name of a window in an adjacent zone or the name of the adjacent zone. If the adjacent zone option is used, the adjacent ceiling is automatically generated in the adjacent zone. If the surface name is used, it must be in the adjacent zone.

\paragraph{Field: Multiplier}\label{field-multiplier-4}

This field is the number of identical items on the base surface. Using Multiplier can save input effort and calculation time. In the calculation the area (and area of frame and divider, if present and surface type is a window) is multiplied by Multiplier. The calculation of shadowing on the subsurfaces (and the calculation of the interior distribution of beam solar radiation transmitted by windows and glass doors) are done for the specified subsurface position and dimensions.

Multiplier should be used with caution. Multiplier \textgreater{} 1 can give inaccurate or nonsensical results in situations where the results are sensitive to window or glass door position. This includes shadowing on the window/glass door, daylighting from the window/glass door, and interior distribution of solar radiation from the window/glass door. In these cases, the results for the single input window/glass door, after multiplication, may not be representative of the results you would get if you entered each of the multiple subsurfaces separately.

If Multiplier \textgreater{} 1, you will get

--a \emph{warning} if Solar Distribution = FullExterior or FullInteriorAndExterior (ref: Building - Field: Solar Distribution), indicating that the shadowing on the input window or the interior solar radiation distribution from the input window may not be representative of the actual group of windows. No warning is issued if Solar Distribution = MinimalShadowing.

--an \emph{error} if the window is an exterior window/glass door in a zone that has a detailed daylighting calculation (Daylighting:Detailed specified for the zone). Since a single window with a multiplier can never give the same daylight illuminance as the actual set of windows, you are not allowed to use Multiplier in this situation.

\paragraph{Starting Corner for the surface}\label{starting-corner-for-the-surface-13}

The rectangular subsurfaces specify the lower left corner of the surface for their starting coordinate. This corner is specified relative to the lower left corner of the base surface by specifying the X and Z values from that corner.

\paragraph{Field: Starting X Coordinate}\label{field-starting-x-coordinate-13}

This field is the X coordinate (in meters).

\paragraph{Field: Starting Z Coordinate}\label{field-starting-z-coordinate-13}

This field is the Z coordinate (in meters).

This field is the length of the window in meters.

\paragraph{Field: Height}\label{field-height-7}

This field is the height of the window in meters.

\subsection{Door:Interzone}\label{doorinterzone}

This is a unique name associated with the door.

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-14}

This is the name of the subsurface's construction (ref: Construction object).

\paragraph{Field: Building Surface Name}\label{field-building-surface-name-4}

This is the name of a surface that contains this subsurface. Certain kinds of surfaces may not be allowed to have subsurfaces. The door assumes the outward facing angle as well as the tilt angle of the base surface.

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition Object}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition-object-4}

The Outside Boundary Condition Object field is the name of a door in an adjacent zone or the name of the adjacent zone. If the adjacent zone option is used, the adjacent ceiling is automatically generated in the adjacent zone. If the surface name is used, it must be in the adjacent zone.

\paragraph{Field: Multiplier}\label{field-multiplier-5}

This field is the number of identical items on the base surface. Using Multiplier can save input effort and calculation time. In the calculation the area (and area of frame and divider, if present and surface type is a window) is multiplied by Multiplier. The calculation of shadowing on the subsurfaces (and the calculation of the interior distribution of beam solar radiation transmitted by windows and glass doors) are done for the specified subsurface position and dimensions.

Multiplier should be used with caution. Multiplier \textgreater{} 1 can give inaccurate or nonsensical results in situations where the results are sensitive to window or glass door position. This includes shadowing on the window/glass door, daylighting from the window/glass door, and interior distribution of solar radiation from the window/glass door. In these cases, the results for the single input window/glass door, after multiplication, may not be representative of the results you would get if you entered each of the multiple subsurfaces separately.

If Multiplier \textgreater{} 1, you will get

--a \emph{warning} if Solar Distribution = FullExterior or FullInteriorAndExterior (ref: Building - Field: Solar Distribution), indicating that the shadowing on the input window or the interior solar radiation distribution from the input window may not be representative of the actual group of windows. No warning is issued if Solar Distribution = MinimalShadowing.

--an \emph{error} if the window is an exterior window/glass door in a zone that has a detailed daylighting calculation (Daylighting:Detailed specified for the zone). Since a single window with a multiplier can never give the same daylight illuminance as the actual set of windows, you are not allowed to use Multiplier in this situation.

\paragraph{Starting Corner for the surface}\label{starting-corner-for-the-surface-14}

The rectangular subsurfaces specify the lower left corner of the surface for their starting coordinate. This corner is specified relative to the lower left corner of the base surface by specifying the X and Z values from that corner.

For windows, if Construction Name is not found among the constructions on the input (.idf) file, the Window Data File (ref. \hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile} object) will be searched for that Construction Name (see ``Importing Windows from WINDOW''). If that file is not present or if the Construction Name does not match the name of an entry on the file, an error will result. If there is a match, a window construction and its corresponding glass and gas materials will be created from the information read from the file.

\paragraph{Field: Building Surface Name}\label{field-building-surface-name-5}

This is the name of a surface that contains this subsurface. Certain kinds of surfaces may not be allowed to have subsurfaces. For example, a surface in contact with the ground (Outside Boundary Condition = Ground) cannot contain a window. The door assumes the outward facing angle as well as the tilt angle of the base surface.

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition Object}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition-object-5}

The Outside Boundary Condition Object field is the name of a glazed (glass) door in an adjacent zone or the name of the adjacent zone. If the adjacent zone option is used, the adjacent ceiling is automatically generated in the adjacent zone. If the surface name is used, it must be in the adjacent zone.

\paragraph{Field: Multiplier}\label{field-multiplier-6}

This field is the number of identical items on the base surface. Using Multiplier can save input effort and calculation time. In the calculation the area (and area of frame and divider, if present and surface type is a window) is multiplied by Multiplier. The calculation of shadowing on the subsurfaces (and the calculation of the interior distribution of beam solar radiation transmitted by windows and glass doors) are done for the specified subsurface position and dimensions.

Multiplier should be used with caution. Multiplier \textgreater{} 1 can give inaccurate or nonsensical results in situations where the results are sensitive to window or glass door position. This includes shadowing on the window/glass door, daylighting from the window/glass door, and interior distribution of solar radiation from the window/glass door. In these cases, the results for the single input window/glass door, after multiplication, may not be representative of the results you would get if you entered each of the multiple subsurfaces separately.

If Multiplier \textgreater{} 1, you will get

--a \emph{warning} if Solar Distribution = FullExterior or FullInteriorAndExterior (ref: Building - Field: Solar Distribution), indicating that the shadowing on the input window or the interior solar radiation distribution from the input window may not be representative of the actual group of windows. No warning is issued if Solar Distribution = MinimalShadowing.

--an \emph{error} if the window is an exterior window/glass door in a zone that has a detailed daylighting calculation (Daylighting:Detailed specified for the zone). Since a single window with a multiplier can never give the same daylight illuminance as the actual set of windows, you are not allowed to use Multiplier in this situation.

\paragraph{Starting Corner for the surface}\label{starting-corner-for-the-surface-15}

\subsection{Surface Vertices}\label{surface-vertices}

Each of the following surfaces:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \hyperref[buildingsurfacedetailed]{BuildingSurface:Detailed}
\item
  \hyperref[walldetailed]{Wall:Detailed}
\item
  \hyperref[roofceilingdetailed]{RoofCeiling:Detailed}
\item
  \hyperref[floordetailed]{Floor:Detailed}
\item
  \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Site:Detailed}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Building:Detailed}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingzonedetailed-000]{Shading:Zone:Detailed}
\end{itemize}

use the same vertex input. The numeric parameters indicated below are taken from the \hyperref[buildingsurfacedetailed]{BuildingSurface:Detailed} definition; the others may not be exactly the same but are identical in configuration. They are also ``extensible'' -- so, to define more vertices for these surfaces, simply add the required number of vertices (X, Y, and Z coordinates for each vertex) to the input file. Note that \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed} is not extensible and is limited to 4 (max) vertices. If the Number of Surface Vertex groups is left blank or entered as \textbf{autocalculate}, EnergyPlus looks at the number of groups entered and figures out how many coordinate groups are entered.

\begin{callout}
\warning{Note that the resolution on the surface vertex input is 1 millimeter (.001 meter). Therefore, using vertices that are very close together (\textless{} 1 mm) may result in invalid dot product and fatal errors during shading calculations.}
\end{callout}

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 29
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image055.png}
\caption{Illustration for Surface Vertices \protect \label{fig:illustration-for-surface-vertices}}
\end{figure}

The figure above will help illustrate Surface Vertex entry. The convention used in ``\hyperref[globalgeometryrules]{GlobalGeometryRules}'' dictates the order of the vertices (ref: \hyperref[globalgeometryrules]{GlobalGeometryRules}). In this example, the conventions used are Starting Vertex Position = UpperLeftCorner and Vertex Entry Direction = CounterClockwise. The surfaces for this single zone are:

\begin{lstlisting}
4,0,0,H, 0,0,0, A,0,0, A,0,H; ! (4 vertices, South Wall)
4,A,0,H,A,0,0,A,B,0,A,B,H; ! (4 vertices, East Wall)
     ignore other walls that are not shown in this figure
4,C,0,J,A,0,H,A,B,H,C,B,J; ! (4 vertices, roof)
3,C,0,J,0,0,H,A,0,H; ! (3 vertices, gable end)
4,0,0,H, 0,0,0, A,0,0, A,0,H; ! (4 vertices, South Wall)
\end{lstlisting}

Note that in this example, point 1 of the entry is the Upper Left Corner of the rectangular surfaces and the point of the triangle for the 3 sided surface. The east wall shows the order of vertex entry. For horizontal surfaces, any vertex may be chosen as the starting position, but the Vertex Entry Direction convention must be followed. The surface details report (Output: Surfaces:List, Details;) is very useful for reviewing the accuracy of surface geometry inputs (ref: Surface Output Variables/Reports and Variable Dictionary Reports).

From the detailed vertices, EnergyPlus tries to determine the ``height'' and ``width'' of the surface. Obviously, this doesn't work well for \textgreater{}4 sided surfaces; for these, if the calculated height and width are not close to the gross area for the surface, the height and width shown will be the square root of the area (and thus a square).

\subsection{Building Surfaces - Detailed}\label{building-surfaces---detailed}

A building surface is necessary for all calculations. There must be at least one building surface per zone. You can use the detailed descriptions as shown below or the simpler, rectangular surface descriptions shown earlier.

\subsection{Wall:Detailed}\label{walldetailed}

The Wall:Detailed object is used to describe walls.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-20-007}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-16-010}

This is a unique name associated with each building surface. It is used in several other places as a reference (e.g.~as the base surface name for a Window or Door).

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-16}

This is the name of the construction (ref: Construction object) used in the surface. Regardless of location in the building, the ``full'' construction (all layers) is used. For example, for an interior wall separating two zones, zone x would have the outside layer (e.g.~drywall) as the material that shows in zone y and then the layers to the inside layer -- the material that shows in zone x. For symmetric constructions, the same construction can be used in the surfaces described in both zones.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-10-000}

This is the zone name to which the surface belongs.

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition}

This value can be one of several things depending on the actual kind of surface.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{Surface} -- if this surface is an internal surface, then this is the choice. The value will either be a surface in the base zone or a surface in another zone. The heat balance between two zones can be accurately simulated by specifying a surface in an adjacent zone. EnergyPlus will simulate a group of zones simultaneously and will include the heat transfer between zones. However, as this increases the complexity of the calculations, it is not necessary to specify the other zone unless the two zones will have a significant temperature difference. If the two zones will not be very different (temperature wise), then the surface should use itself as the outside environment or specify this field as \textbf{Adiabatic}. The surface name on the ``outside'' of this surface (adjacent to) is placed in the next field.
  \item
    \textbf{Adiabatic} -- an internal surface in the same Zone. This surface will not transfer heat out of the zone, but will still store heat in thermal mass. Only the inside face of the surface will exchange heat with the zone (i.e.~two adiabatic surfaces are required to model internal partitions where both sides of the surface are exchanging heat with the zone). The Outside Boundary Condition Object can be left blank.
  \item
    \textbf{Zone} -- this is similar to Surface but EnergyPlus will automatically create the required surface in the adjacent zone when this is entered for the surface. If there are windows or doors on the surface, EnergyPlus automatically creates appropriate sub-surfaces as well.
  \item
    \textbf{Outdoors} -- if this surface is exposed to outside temperature conditions, then this is the choice. See Sun Exposure and Wind Exposure below for further specifications on this kind of surface.
  \item
    \textbf{Foundation} - uses an alternative model (currently only the Kiva\textsuperscript{TM} model) to account for the multi-dimensional heat transfer of foundation surfaces. The Outside Boundary Condition Object will refer to the name of a \hyperref[foundationkiva]{Foundation:Kiva} object (or be left blank to use the default foundation without extra insulation).
  \item
    \textbf{Ground} - The temperature on the outside of this surface will be the Site:GroundTemperature:Surface value for the month.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundFCfactorMethod} -- if this surface is exposed to the ground and using the \textbf{\hyperref[constructioncfactorundergroundwall]{Construction:CfactorUndergroundWall}}, then this is the choice. The temperature on the outside of this surface will be the Site:GroundTemperature:FcfactorMethod value for the month.
  \item
    \textbf{OtherSideCoefficients} -- if this surface has a custom, user specified temperature or other parameters (See \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} specification), then this is the choice. The outside boundary condition will be the name of the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} specification.
  \item
    \textbf{OtherSideConditionsModel} -- if this surface has a specially-modeled multi-skin component, such as a transpired collector or vented photovoltaic panel, attached to the outside (See \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersideconditionsmodel]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel} specification), then this the choice. The outside face environment will be the name of the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersideconditionsmodel]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel} specification.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorAverage} -- uses the average results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorCore} -- uses the core results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorPerimeter} -- uses the perimeter results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorAverageWall} -- uses the average wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorAverageFloor} -- uses the average floor results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorUpperWall} -- uses the upper wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorLowerWall} -- uses the lower wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition Object}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition-object-6}

If neither Surface, Zone, Foundation, OtherSideCoefficients, or OtherSideConditionsModel are specified for the Outside Boundary Condition (previous field), then this field should be left blank.

As stated above, if the Outside Boundary Condition is ``Surface'', then this field's value must be the surface name whose inside face temperature will be forced on the outside face of the base surface. This permits heat exchange between adjacent zones (interzone heat transfer) when multiple zones are simulated, but can also be used to simulate middle zone behavior without modeling the adjacent zones. This is done by specifying a surface within the zone. For example, a middle floor zone can be modeled by making the floor the Outside Boundary Condition Object for the ceiling, and the ceiling the Outside Boundary Condition Object for the floor.

If the Outside Boundary Condition is Zone, then this field should contain the zone name of the adjacent zone for the surface.

\begin{callout}
Note: Zones with interzone heat transfer are not adiabatic and the internal surfaces contribute to gains or losses. Adiabatic surfaces are modeled by specifying the base surface itself in this field. Also, for interzone heat transfer, both surfaces must be represented -- for example, if you want interzone heat transfer to an attic space, the ceiling in the lower zone must have a surface object with the outside face environment as the floor in the attic and, likewise, there must be a floor surface object in the attic that references the ceiling surface name in the lower zone.
\end{callout}

Equally, if the Outside Boundary Condition is ``OtherSideCoefficients'', then this field's value must be the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} name. Or if the Outside Boundary Condition is ``OtherSideConditionsModel'' then this field's value must be the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersideconditionsmodel]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel} name.

\paragraph{Field: Sun Exposure}\label{field-sun-exposure-000}

If the surface is exposed to the sun, then ``SunExposed'' should be entered in this field. Otherwise, ``NoSun'' should be entered.

Note, a cantilevered floor could have ``Outdoors'' but ``NoSun'' exposure.

\paragraph{Field: Wind Exposure}\label{field-wind-exposure}

If the surface is exposed to the Wind, then ``WindExposed'' should be entered in this field. Otherwise, ``NoWind'' should be entered.

\begin{callout}
Note: When a surface is specified with ``NoWind'', this has several implications. Within the heat balance code, this surface will default to using the simple ASHRAE exterior convection coefficient correlation with a zero wind speed. In addition, since the ASHRAE simple method does not have a separate value for equivalent long wavelength radiation to the sky and ground, using ``NoWind'' also eliminates long wavelength radiant exchange from the exterior of the surface to both the sky and the ground. Thus, only simple convection takes place at the exterior face of a surface specified with ``NoWind''.
\end{callout}

\paragraph{Field: View Factor to Ground}\label{field-view-factor-to-ground}

The fraction of the ground plane (assumed horizontal) that is visible from a heat-transfer surface. It is used to calculate the diffuse solar radiation from the ground that is incident on the surface.

For example, if there are no obstructions, a vertical surface sees half of the ground plane and so View Factor to Ground = 0.5. A horizontal downward-facing surface sees the entire ground plane, so View Factor to Ground = 1.0. A horizontal upward-facing surface (horizontal roof) does not see the ground at all, so View Factor to Ground = 0.0.

Unused if reflections option in Solar Distribution field in Building object input unless a \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} or \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular} has been specified.

If you do not use the reflections option in the Solar Distribution field in your Building object input, you are responsible for entering the View Factor to Ground for each heat-transfer surface. Typical values for a surface that is not shadowed are obtained by the simple equation:

View Factor to Ground = (1-cos(SurfTilt))/2

For example, this gives 0.5 for a wall of tilt 90°. If the tilt of the wall changes, then the View Factor to Ground must also change.

If you enter \textbf{autocalculate} in this field, EnergyPlus will automatically calculate the view factor to ground based on the tilt of the surface.

If \textbf{you do use the reflections option in the Solar Distribution field} in your Building object input, you do \textbf{not} have to enter View Factor to Ground values. In this case the program will automatically calculate the value to use for each exterior surface taking into account solar shadowing (including shadowing of the ground by the building) and reflections from obstructions (ref: Building, Field: Solar Distribution).

However, if you do use the reflections option AND you are modeling a \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} or \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular}, then you still need to enter some values of View Factor to Ground. For \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} you need to enter View Factor to Ground for the window associated with the shelf. And for \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular} you need to enter the View Factor to Ground for the \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed} corresponding to the dome of the tubular device.

Note 1: The corresponding view factor to the sky for diffuse solar radiation is not a user input; it is calculated within EnergyPlus based on surface orientation, sky solar radiance distribution, and shadowing surfaces.

Note 2: The view factors to the sky and ground for thermal infrared (long-wave) radiation are not user inputs; they are calculated within EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces. Shadowing surfaces are considered to have the same emissivity and temperature as the ground, so they are lumped together with the ground in calculating the ground IR view factor.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Vertices}\label{field-number-of-vertices}

This field specifies the number of sides in the surface (number of X,Y,Z vertex groups). For further information, see the discussion on ``Surface Vertices'' above.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-21-007}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-17-008}

This is a unique name associated with each building surface. It is used in several other places as a reference (e.g.~as the base surface name for a Window or Door).

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-17}

This is the name of the construction (ref: Construction object) used in the surface. Regardless of location in the building, the ``full'' construction (all layers) is used. For example, for an interior wall separating two zones, zone x would have the outside layer (e.g.~drywall) as the material that shows in zone y and then the layers to the inside layer -- the material that shows in zone x. For symmetric constructions, the same construction can be used in the surfaces described in both zones.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-11-000}

This is the zone name to which the surface belongs.

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition-1}

This value can be one of several things depending on the actual kind of surface.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{Surface} -- if this surface is an internal surface, then this is the choice. The value will either be a surface in the base zone or a surface in another zone. The heat balance between two zones can be accurately simulated by specifying a surface in an adjacent zone. EnergyPlus will simulate a group of zones simultaneously and will include the heat transfer between zones. However, as this increases the complexity of the calculations, it is not necessary to specify the other zone unless the two zones will have a significant temperature difference. If the two zones will not be very different (temperature wise), then the surface should use itself as the outside environment or specify this field as \textbf{Adiabatic}. The surface name on the ``outside'' of this surface (adjacent to) is placed in the next field.
  \item
    \textbf{Adiabatic} -- an internal surface in the same Zone. This surface will not transfer heat out of the zone, but will still store heat in thermal mass. Only the inside face of the surface will exchange heat with the zone (i.e.~two adiabatic surfaces are required to model internal partitions where both sides of the surface are exchanging heat with the zone). The Outside Boundary Condition Object can be left blank.
  \item
    \textbf{Zone} -- this is similar to Surface but EnergyPlus will automatically create the required surface in the adjacent zone when this is entered for the surface. If there are windows or doors on the surface, EnergyPlus automatically creates appropriate sub-surfaces as well.
  \item
    \textbf{Outdoors} -- if this surface is exposed to outside temperature conditions, then this is the choice. See Sun Exposure and Wind Exposure below for further specifications on this kind of surface.
  \item
    \textbf{Ground} -- The temperature on the outside of this surface will be the Ground Temperature.
  \item
    \textbf{OtherSideCoefficients} -- if this surface has a custom, user specified temperature or other parameters (See \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} specification), then this is the choice. The outside boundary condition will be the name of the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} specification.
  \item
    \textbf{OtherSideConditionsModel} -- if this surface has a specially-modeled multi-skin component, such as a transpired collector or vented photovoltaic panel, attached to the outside (See \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersideconditionsmodel]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel} specification), then this the choice. The outside face environment will be the name of the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersideconditionsmodel]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel} specification.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorAverage} -- uses the average results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorCore} -- uses the core results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorPerimeter} -- uses the perimeter results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorAverageWall} -- uses the average wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorAverageFloor} -- uses the average floor results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorUpperWall} -- uses the upper wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorLowerWall} -- uses the lower wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
\end{enumerate}

Note, a cantilevered floor could have ``Outdoors'' but ``NoSun'' exposure.

\subsection{BuildingSurface:Detailed}\label{buildingsurfacedetailed}

The BuildingSurface:Detailed object can more generally describe each of the surfaces.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-23-006}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-19-005}

This is a unique name associated with each building surface. It is used in several other places as a reference (e.g.~as the base surface name for a Window or Door).

\paragraph{Field: Surface Type}\label{field-surface-type-000}

Used primarily for convenience, the surface type can be one of the choices illustrated above -- Wall, Floor, Ceiling, Roof. Azimuth (facing) and Tilt are determined from the vertex coordinates. Note that ``normal'' floors will be tilted 180° whereas flat roofs/ceilings will be tilted 0°. EnergyPlus uses this field's designation, along with the calculated tilt of the surface, to issue warning messages when tilts are ``out of range''. Calculations in EnergyPlus use the actual calculated tilt values for the actual heat balance calculations. Note, however, that a floor tilted 0° is really facing ``into'' the zone and is not what you will desire for the calculations even though the coordinate may appear correct in the viewed DXF display.

``Normal'' tilt for walls is 90° -- here you may use the calculated Azimuth to make sure your walls are facing away from the zone's interior.

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-19}

This is the name of the construction (ref: Construction object) used in the surface. Regardless of location in the building, the ``full'' construction (all layers) is used. For example, for an interior wall separating two zones, zone x would have the outside layer (e.g.~drywall) as the material that shows in zone y and then the layers to the inside layer -- the material that shows in zone x. For symmetric constructions, the same construction can be used in the surfaces described in both zones.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-13}

This is the zone name to which the surface belongs.

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition-3}

This value can be one of several things depending on the actual kind of surface.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{Surface} -- if this surface is an internal surface, then this is the choice. The value will either be a surface in the base zone or a surface in another zone. The heat balance between two zones can be accurately simulated by specifying a surface in an adjacent zone. EnergyPlus will simulate a group of zones simultaneously and will include the heat transfer between zones. However, as this increases the complexity of the calculations, it is not necessary to specify the other zone unless the two zones will have a significant temperature difference. If the two zones will not be very different (temperature wise), then the surface should use itself as the outside environment or specify this field as \textbf{Adiabatic}. The surface name on the ``outside'' of this surface (adjacent to) is placed in the next field.
  \item
    \textbf{Adiabatic} -- an internal surface in the same Zone. This surface will not transfer heat out of the zone, but will still store heat in thermal mass. Only the inside face of the surface will exchange heat with the zone (i.e.~two adiabatic surfaces are required to model internal partitions where both sides of the surface are exchanging heat with the zone). The Outside Boundary Condition Object can be left blank.
  \item
    \textbf{Zone} -- this is similar to Surface but EnergyPlus will automatically create the required surface in the adjacent zone when this is entered for the surface. If there are windows or doors on the surface, EnergyPlus automatically creates appropriate sub-surfaces as well.
  \item
    \textbf{Outdoors} -- if this surface is exposed to outside temperature conditions, then this is the choice. See Sun Exposure and Wind Exposure below for further specifications on this kind of surface.
  \item
    \textbf{Foundation} - uses an alternative model (currently only the Kiva\textsuperscript{TM} model) to account for the multi-dimensional heat transfer of foundation surfaces. The Outside Boundary Condition Object will refer to the name of a \hyperref[foundationkiva]{Foundation:Kiva} object (or be left blank to use the default foundation without extra insulation).
  \item
    \textbf{Ground} - The temperature on the outside of this surface will be the Site:GroundTemperature:Surface value for the month.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundFCfactorMethod} -- if this surface is exposed to the ground and using the \textbf{\hyperref[constructioncfactorundergroundwall]{Construction:CfactorUndergroundWall}}, then this is the choice. The temperature on the outside of this surface will be the Site:GroundTemperature:FcfactorMethod value for the month.
  \item
    \textbf{OtherSideCoefficients} -- if this surface has a custom, user specified temperature or other parameters (See \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} specification), then this is the choice. The outside boundary condition will be the name of the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} specification.
  \item
    \textbf{OtherSideConditionsModel} -- if this surface has a specially-modeled multi-skin component, such as a transpired collector or vented photovoltaic panel, attached to the outside (See \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersideconditionsmodel]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel} specification), then this the choice. The outside face environment will be the name of the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersideconditionsmodel]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel} specification.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorAverage} -- uses the average results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorCore} -- uses the core results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundSlabPreprocessorPerimeter} -- uses the perimeter results from the Slab preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorAverageWall} -- uses the average wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorAverageFloor} -- uses the average floor results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorUpperWall} -- uses the upper wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
  \item
    \textbf{GroundBasementPreprocessorLowerWall} -- uses the lower wall results from the Basement preprocessor calculations.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition Object}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition-object-9}

If neither Surface, Zone, Foundation, OtherSideCoefficients, or OtherSideConditionsModel are specified for the Outside Boundary Condition (previous field), then this field should be left blank.

As stated above, if the Outside Boundary Condition is ``Surface'', then this field's value must be the surface name whose inside face temperature will be forced on the outside face of the base surface. This permits heat exchange between adjacent zones (interzone heat transfer) when multiple zones are simulated, but can also be used to simulate middle zone behavior without modeling the adjacent zones. This is done by specifying a surface within the zone. For example, a middle floor zone can be modeled by making the floor the Outside Boundary Condition Object for the ceiling, and the ceiling the Outside Boundary Condition Object for the floor.

If the Outside Boundary Condition is Zone, then this field should contain the zone name of the adjacent zone for the surface.

\begin{callout}
Note: Zones with interzone heat transfer are not adiabatic and the internal surfaces contribute to gains or losses. Adiabatic surfaces are modeled by specifying the base surface itself in this field. Also, for interzone heat transfer, both surfaces must be represented -- for example, if you want interzone heat transfer to an attic space, the ceiling in the lower zone must have a surface object with the outside face environment as the floor in the attic and, likewise, there must be a floor surface object in the attic that references the ceiling surface name in the lower zone.
\end{callout}

Equally, if the Outside Boundary Condition is ``OtherSideCoefficients'', then this field's value must be the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} name. Or if the Outside Boundary Condition is ``OtherSideConditionsModel'' then this field's value must be the \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersideconditionsmodel]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel} name.

\paragraph{Field: Sun Exposure}\label{field-sun-exposure-3}

If the surface is exposed to the sun, then ``SunExposed'' should be entered in this field. Otherwise, ``NoSun'' should be entered.

Note, a cantilevered floor could have ``Outdoors'' but ``NoSun'' exposure.

\paragraph{Field: Wind Exposure}\label{field-wind-exposure-3}

If the surface is exposed to the Wind, then ``WindExposed'' should be entered in this field. Otherwise, ``NoWind'' should be entered.

\begin{callout}
Note: When a surface is specified with ``NoWind'', this has several implications. Within the heat balance code, this surface will default to using the simple ASHRAE exterior convection coefficient correlation with a zero wind speed. In addition, since the ASHRAE simple method does not have a separate value for equivalent long wavelength radiation to the sky and ground, using ``NoWind'' also eliminates long wavelength radiant exchange from the exterior of the surface to both the sky and the ground. Thus, only simple convection takes place at the exterior face of a surface specified with ``NoWind''.
\end{callout}

\paragraph{Field: View Factor to Ground}\label{field-view-factor-to-ground-3}

The fraction of the ground plane (assumed horizontal) that is visible from a heat-transfer surface. It is used to calculate the diffuse solar radiation from the ground that is incident on the surface.

For example, if there are no obstructions, a vertical surface sees half of the ground plane and so View Factor to Ground = 0.5. A horizontal downward-facing surface sees the entire ground plane, so View Factor to Ground = 1.0. A horizontal upward-facing surface (horizontal roof) does not see the ground at all, so View Factor to Ground = 0.0.

Unused if reflections option in Solar Distribution field in Building object input unless a \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} or \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular} has been specified.

If you do not use the reflections option in the Solar Distribution field in your Building object input, you are responsible for entering the View Factor to Ground for each heat-transfer surface. Typical values for a surface that is not shadowed are obtained by the simple equation:

View Factor to Ground = (1-cos(SurfTilt))/2

For example, this gives 0.5 for a wall of tilt 90°. If the tilt of the wall changes, then the View Factor to Ground must also change.

If you enter \textbf{autocalculate} in this field, EnergyPlus will automatically calculate the view factor to ground based on the tilt of the surface.

If \textbf{you do use the reflections option in the Solar Distribution field} in your Building object input, you do \textbf{not} have to enter View Factor to Ground values. In this case the program will automatically calculate the value to use for each exterior surface taking into account solar shadowing (including shadowing of the ground by the building) and reflections from obstructions (ref: Building, Field: Solar Distribution).

However, if you do use the reflections option AND you are modeling a \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} or \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular}, then you still need to enter some values of View Factor to Ground. For \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} you need to enter View Factor to Ground for the window associated with the shelf. And for \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular} you need to enter the View Factor to Ground for the \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed} corresponding to the dome of the tubular device.

Note 1: The corresponding view factor to the sky for diffuse solar radiation is not a user input; it is calculated within EnergyPlus based on surface orientation, sky solar radiance distribution, and shadowing surfaces.

Note 2: The view factors to the sky and ground for thermal infrared (long-wave) radiation are not user inputs; they are calculated within EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces. Shadowing surfaces are considered to have the same emissivity and temperature as the ground, so they are lumped together with the ground in calculating the ground IR view factor.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Vertices}\label{field-number-of-vertices-3}

This field specifies the number of sides in the surface (number of X,Y,Z vertex groups). For further information, see the discussion on ``Surface Vertices'' above.

\subsection{FenestrationSurface:Detailed}\label{fenestrationsurfacedetailed}

This surface class is used for subsurfaces, which can be of five different types: Windows, Doors, GlassDoors, TubularDaylightDomes, and TubularDaylightDiffusers. A subsurface (such as a window) of a base surface (such as a wall) inherits several of the properties (such as Outside Boundary Condition, Sun Exposure, etc.) of the base surface. Windows, GlassDoors, TubularDaylightDomes, and TubularDaylightDiffusers are considered to have one or more glass layers and so transmit solar radiation. Doors are considered to be opaque. For Surface Type = Window and GlassDoor, shades and screens may be applied by referencing this subsurface in a window shading control (ref: \hyperref[windowpropertyshadingcontrol]{WindowShadingControl} object). To assign a shade to a window or glass door, see WindowMaterial: Shade. To assign a screen, see \hyperref[windowmaterialscreen]{WindowMaterial:Screen}. To assign a blind, see \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}. To assign switchable glazing, such as electrochromic glazing, see \hyperref[windowpropertyshadingcontrol]{WindowShadingControl}.

The surface can be of 3 sides or 4 sides. A 4-sided but non-rectangular fenestration surface is allowed and will be transferred to an equivalent rectangular surface with the same area and aspect ratio for the convection calculations at window air gaps.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-24-004}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-20-004}

This is a unique name associated with the heat transfer subsurface. It may be used in other places as a reference (e.g.~as the opposing subsurface of an interzone window or door).

\paragraph{Field: Surface Type}\label{field-surface-type-2016-06-16}

The choices for Surface Type are Window, Door, GlassDoor, TubularDaylightDome, and TubularDaylightDiffuser. Doors are assumed to be opaque (do not transmit solar radiation) whereas the other surface types do transmit solar radiation. Windows and Glass Doors are treated identically in the calculation of conduction heat transfer, solar gain, daylighting, etc. A Window or GlassDoor, but not a Door, can have a movable interior, exterior or between-glass shading device, such as blinds (ref: \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind} object), and can have a frame and/or a divider (ref: \hyperref[windowpropertyframeanddivider]{WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider} object). TubularDaylightDomes and TubularDaylightDomes are specialized subsurfaces for use with the \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular} object to simulate Tubular Daylighting Devices (TDDs). TubularDaylightDomes and TubularDaylightDomes cannot have shades, screens or blinds. In the following, the term ``window'' applies to Window, GlassDoor, TubularDaylightDome, and TubularDaylightDome, if not otherwise explicitly mentioned.

As noted in the description of the \hyperref[buildingsurfacedetailed]{BuildingSurface:Detailed}, Azimuth (facing angle) and Tilt are calculated from the entered vertices. Tilts of subsurfaces will normally be the same as their base surface. If these are significantly beyond the ``normals'' for the base surface, warning messages may be issued. If the facing angles are not correct, you may have a window pointing ``into'' the zone rather than out of it -- this would cause problems in the calculations. Note, too, that a ``reveal'' (inset or outset) may occur if the plane of the subsurface is not coincident with the base surface; the reveal has an effect on shading of the subsurface.

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-20}

This is the name of the subsurface's construction (ref: Construction object {[}for Door{]} and Construction, \hyperref[constructioncomplexfenestrationstate]{Construction:ComplexFenestrationState}, \hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile} objects {[}for Window and GlassDoor{]}).

For windows, if Construction Name is not found among the constructions on the input (.idf) file, the Window Data File (ref. \hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile} object) will be searched for that Construction Name (see ``Importing Windows from WINDOW''). If that file is not present or if the Construction Name does not match the name of an entry on the file, an error will result. If there is a match, a window construction and its corresponding glass and gas materials will be created from the information read from the file.

\paragraph{Field: Building Surface Name}\label{field-building-surface-name-6}

This is the name of a surface that contains this subsurface. Certain kinds of surfaces may not be allowed to have subsurfaces. For example, a surface in contact with the ground (Outside Boundary Condition = Ground) cannot contain a window.

\paragraph{Field: Outside Boundary Condition Object}\label{field-outside-boundary-condition-object-10}

If the base surface has Outside Boundary Condition = Surface or OtherSideCoefficients, then this field must also be specified for the subsurface. Otherwise, it can be left blank.

If the base surface has Outside Boundary Condition = Zone, then this surface retains that characteristic and uses the same zone of the base surface. It can be entered here for clarity or it can be left blank.

If Outside Boundary Condition for the base surface is Surface, this field should specify the subsurface in the opposing zone that is the counterpart to this subsurface. The constructions of the subsurface and opposing subsurface must match, except that, for multi-layer constructions, the layer order of the opposing subsurface's construction must be the reverse of that of the subsurface.

If Outside Boundary Condition for the base surface is OtherSideCoefficients, this field could specify the set of \hyperref[surfacepropertyothersidecoefficients]{SurfaceProperty:OtherSideCoefficients} for this subsurface. If this is left blank, then the Other Side Coefficients of the base surface will be used for this subsurface. \emph{Windows and GlassDoors are not allowed to have Other Side Coefficients.}

\paragraph{Field: View Factor to Ground}\label{field-view-factor-to-ground-4}

The fraction of the ground plane (assumed horizontal) that is visible from a heat-transfer surface. It is used to calculate the diffuse solar radiation from the ground that is incident on the surface.

For example, if there are no obstructions, a vertical surface sees half of the ground plane and so View Factor to Ground = 0.5. A horizontal downward-facing surface sees the entire ground plane, so View Factor to Ground = 1.0. A horizontal upward-facing surface (horizontal roof) does not see the ground at all, so View Factor to Ground = 0.0.

Unused if reflections option in Solar Distribution field in Building object input unless a Daylighting Device:Shelf or Daylighting Device:Tubular has been specified.

If you do not use the reflections option in the Solar Distribution field in your Building object input, you are responsible for entering the View Factor to Ground for each heat-transfer surface. Typical values for a surface that is not shadowed are obtained by the simple equation:

View Factor to Ground = (1-cos(SurfTilt))/2

For example, this gives 0.5 for a wall of tilt 90°. If the tilt of the wall changes, then the View Factor to Ground must also change.

If you enter \textbf{autocalculate} in this field, EnergyPlus will automatically calculate the view factor to ground based on the tilt of the surface.

If \textbf{you do use the reflections option in the Solar Distribution field} in your BUILDING object input, you do \textbf{not} have to enter View Factor to Ground values. In this case the program will automatically calculate the value to use for each exterior surface taking into account solar shadowing (including shadowing of the ground by the building) and reflections from obstructions (ref: Building, Field: Solar Distribution).

However, if you do use the reflections option AND you are modeling a \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} or \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular}, then you should enter some values of View Factor to Ground. For \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} you need to enter View Factor to Ground for the window associated with the shelf. And for \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular} you need to enter the View Factor to Ground for the FenestrationSurface:Detailed corresponding to the dome of the tubular device (ref: \hyperref[daylightingdevicetubular]{DaylightingDevice:Tubular}).

Note 1: The corresponding view factor to the sky for diffuse solar radiation is not a user input; it is calculated within EnergyPlus based on surface orientation, sky solar radiance distribution, and shadowing surfaces.

Note 2: The view factors to the sky and ground for thermal infrared (long-wave) radiation are not user inputs; they are calculated within EnergyPlus based on surface tilt and shadowing surfaces. Shadowing surfaces are considered to have the same emissivity and temperature as the ground, so they are lumped together with the ground in calculating the ground infrared view factor.

Note 3: If the view factor to the ground is autosized and a \hyperref[daylightingdeviceshelf]{DaylightingDevice:Shelf} is present, EnergyPlus will adjust both the view factor to the ground first and then the sky so that the sum of all three view factors (to the ground, to the sky, and to the shelf) does not exceed 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Frame and Divider Name}\label{field-frame-and-divider-name-2}

This field, if not blank, can be used to specify window frame, divider and reveal-surface data (ref: \hyperref[windowpropertyframeanddivider]{WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider} object). It is used only for exterior GlassDoors and rectangular exterior Windows, i.e., those with OutsideFaceEnvironment = Outdoors.

This field should be blank for triangular windows.

\paragraph{Field: Multiplier}\label{field-multiplier-7}

Used only for Surface Type = Window, Door or Glass Door. It is the number of identical items on the base surface. Using Multiplier can save input effort and calculation time. In the calculation the area (and area of frame and divider, if present and surface type is a window) is multiplied by Multiplier. The calculation of shadowing on the subsurfaces (and the calculation of the interior distribution of beam solar radiation transmitted by windows and glass doors) are done for the specified subsurface position and dimensions.

Multiplier should be used with caution. Multiplier \textgreater{} 1 can give inaccurate or nonsensical results in situations where the results are sensitive to window or glass door position. This includes shadowing on the window/glass door, daylighting from the window/glass door, and interior distribution of solar radiation from the window/glass door. In these cases, the results for the single input window/glass door, after multiplication, may not be representative of the results you would get if you entered each of the multiple subsurfaces separately.

If Multiplier \textgreater{} 1, you will get

--a \emph{warning} if Solar Distribution = FullExterior or FullInteriorAndExterior (ref: Building - Field: Solar Distribution), indicating that the shadowing on the input window or the interior solar radiation distribution from the input window may not be representative of the actual group of windows. No warning is issued if Solar Distribution = MinimalShadowing.

--an \emph{error} if the window is an exterior window/glass door in a zone that has a detailed daylighting calculation (Daylighting:Detailed specified for the zone). Since a single window with a multiplier can never give the same daylight illuminance as the actual set of windows, you are not allowed to use Multiplier in this situation.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Vertices}\label{field-number-of-vertices-4}

The number of sides the surface has (number of X,Y,Z vertex groups). For further information, see the discussion on ``Surface Vertices'' above. Door and GlassDoor subsurfaces are rectangular and therefore have four vertices. Window subsurfaces can be rectangular or triangular and therefore have four or three vertices, respectively.

\paragraph{Fields: Vertex Coordinates}\label{fields-vertex-coordinates}

This is a total of twelve fields giving the x,y,z coordinate values of the four vertices of rectangular subsurfaces {[}m{]}, or a total of nine fields giving the x,y,z coordinate values of the three vertices of triangular windows.

For triangular windows the first vertex listed can be any of the three vertices, but the order of the vertices should be counter-clockwise if VertexEntry is CounterClockWise and clockwise if VertexEntry is ClockWise (ref: \hyperref[globalgeometryrules]{GlobalGeometryRules}).

\subsection{InternalMass}\label{internalmass}

Any surface that would logically be described as an interior wall, floor or ceiling can just as easily be described as Internal Mass. Internal Mass surface types only exchange energy with the zone in which they are described; they do not see any other zones. There are two approaches to using internal mass. The first approach is to have several pieces of internal mass with each piece having a different construction type. The other approach is to choose an average construction type and combine all of the interior surfaces into a single internal mass. Similar to internal surfaces with an adiabatic boundary condition, the zone will only exchange energy with the inside of the Internal Mass construction. If both sides of the surface exchange energy with the zone then the user should input twice the area when defining the Internal Mass object. Note that furniture and other large objects within a zone can be described using internal mass. However, simplifying calculations using internal mass must be used with caution when the ``FullInteriorAndExterior'' or ``FullInteriorAndExteriorWithReflections'' Solar Distribution model (see Building parameters) is chosen. A single Internal Mass object can be applied to a set of zones. This requires specifying a zone list name instead of a zone name in the input field \textit{Zone or ZoneList Name}.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-25-004}

\textbf{Example}

When zoning an office building, five west-facing offices have been combined into one zone. All of the offices have interior walls made of the same materials. As shown in the figure below, this zone may be described with 5 exterior walls and 11 internal walls or 1 exterior wall and 1 internal mass. Note that fewer surfaces will speed up the EnergyPlus calculations.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 30
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image056.png}
\caption{Representing 11 internal walls as internal mass \protect \label{fig:representing-11-internal-walls-as-internal}}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Example}

A five-story building has the same ceiling/floor construction separating each of the levels. Zones that are on floors 2 through 4 may be described using a single piece of internal mass to represent both the floor and ceiling. The construction for this internal mass would be identical to the ceiling/floor construction that would be used to describe separate surfaces and the area of the internal mass surface would be the total surface area of the combined ceilings/floors (i.e.~twice the total floor area).

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-21-004}

This is a unique character string associated with the internal mass surface. Though it must be unique from other surface names, it is used primarily for convenience with internal mass surfaces.

\paragraph{Field: Construction Name}\label{field-construction-name-21}

This is the name of the construction (ref: Construction object) used in the surface.

\paragraph{Field: Zone or ZoneList Name}\label{field-zone-or-zonelist-name-14}

This field is the name of the zone (ref: Zone) or ZoneList (ref: ZoneList) and represents a particular internal mass object in a thermal zone or set of thermal zones in the building. When the ZoneList option is used then this internal mass object is applied to each of the zones in the zone list. The name of the actual internal mass object in each zone becomes <Zone Name> <InternalMass Object Name> and should be less than the standard length (100 characters) for a name field. If it is greater than this standard length, it may be difficult to specify in output reporting as it will be truncated. A warning will be shown if the generated name is greater than 100 characters. If it duplicates another such concatenated name, there will be a severe error and terminate the run.

\paragraph{Field: Surface Area}\label{field-surface-area}

This field is the surface area of the internal mass. The area that is specified must be the entire surface area that is exposed to the zone. If both sides of a wall are completely within the same zone, then the area of both sides must be included when describing that internal wall.

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Surface Window Total Absorbed Shortwave Radiation Rate Layer \textless{}x\textgreater{} {[}W{]}}\label{surface-window-total-absorbed-shortwave-radiation-rate-layer-x-w}

This will output shortwave radiation absorbed in a window layer. The key values for this output variable are the surface name. Layers are numbered from the outside to the inside of the surface. The full listing will appear in the RDD file. Note that this variable is only defined for constructions defined by a \hyperref[constructioncomplexfenestrationstate]{Construction:ComplexFenestrationState}.

\subsubsection{Surface Window Front Face Temperature Layer \textless{}x\textgreater{} {[}C{]}}\label{surface-window-front-face-temperature-layer-x-c}

This will output a temperature for the front face of the layer. The layer front face is considered to be the face closest to the outside environment. The full listing will appear in the RDD file. Note that this variable is only defined for constructions defined by a \hyperref[constructioncomplexfenestrationstate]{Construction:ComplexFenestrationState}.  For other window constructions, this variable is also defined for the outer layer (Layer 1) only. The value will be identical to the \hyperref[surface-outside-face-temperature-c]{Surface Outside Face Temperature}.


\subsubsection{Surface Window Back Face Temperature Layer \textless{}x\textgreater{} {[}C{]}}\label{surface-window-back-face-temperature-layer-x-c}

This will output a temperature for the back face of the layer. The layer back face is considered to be the face closest to the inside environment. The full listing will appear in the RDD file. Note that this variable is only defined for constructions defined by a \hyperref[constructioncomplexfenestrationstate]{Construction:ComplexFenestrationState}.  For other window constructions, this variable is also defined for the inner layer only. The value will be identical to the \hyperref[surface-inside-face-temperature-c]{Surface Inside Face Temperature}.

\subsection{Surface Output Variables (all heat transfer surfaces)}\label{surface-output-variables-all-heat-transfer-surfaces}

The various output variables related to surface heat transfer are organized around the inside and outside face of each surface. The zone heat balance model draws energy balances at each side, or face, of a surface and so each surface essentially has two sets of results. The inside face is the side of a heat transfer surface that faces toward the thermal zone. The outside face is the side of a heat transfer surface that faces away from the thermal zone, typically facing outdoors. The Key Value for these is generally the user-defined name of the surface.

\subsubsection{Surface Inside Face Heat Balance Calculation Iteration Count {[]}}\label{surface-inside-face-heat-balance-calculation-iteration-count}

This output is the number of iterations used in a part of the solution for surface heat transfer that accounts for thermal radiation heat transfer between zone surfaces. This is simply a counter on the iteration loop for inside face surface modeling. There is only one instance of this output in a given run and the Key Value is ``Simulation.''

\subsubsection{Surface Inside Face Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{surface-inside-face-temperature-c}

This is the temperature of the surface's inside face, in degrees Celsius. Former Name: Prior to version 7.1 this output was called Surface Inside Temperature.

\subsubsection{Surface Inside Face Interior Movable Insulation Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{surface-inside-face-interior-movable-insulation-temperature-c}

This is the temperature of movable insulation installed on the inside of the construction at the movable insulation's inside face (the one facing the zone), in degrees Celsius. This variable is only valid when the surface has movable insulation and the movable insulation is actually scheduled to be present.  For surfaces that have no movable insulation or the movable insulation is not scheduled to be present, the value of this variable is set to the Surface Inside Face Temperature.  It should be noted that users can limit how often this output variable is generating by using a schedule to control when this output is produced.  For example, this user could add the following syntax to an input file that includes movable insulation:

\begin{lstlisting}
  Output:Variable,Zone1:WestWall,Surface Inside Face Interior Movable Insulation Temperature,timestep,MovableInsulationSchedule;
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, interior movable insulation is used on the west wall of zone 1 and is only present when the schedule (MovableInsulationSchedule) is greater than zero.  Adding this output variable syntax to the input file reports the temperature at the inside face of the interior movable insulation only when the movable insulation is present.  The use of the movable insulation schedule in the output variable designation limits when this value shows up in the EnergyPlus output file to when it is actually scheduled to be present.  At other times, no value will be reported.  The limiting of when the output is generated allows the user to generate useful statistics instead of having those statistics influenced by values for when the movable insulation is not present.  If the user does not use the output variable schedule feature, the output for this variable will equal the surface inside face temperature when the movable insulation is not present.

\subsubsection{Surface Outside Face Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{surface-outside-face-temperature-c}

This is the temperature of the surface's outside face, in degrees Celsius. Former Name: Prior to version 7.1, this output was called Surface Outside Temperature.

\subsubsection{Surface Inside Face Adjacent Air Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{surface-inside-face-adjacent-air-temperature-c}

This is the effective bulk air temperature used for modeling the inside surface convection heat transfer. This is the same as the zone mean air temperature when using the mixing model for roomair. However, if more advanced roomair models are used, this variable will report the air temperature predicted by the roomair model as it was used in the surface heat balance model calculations. Former Name: Prior to version 7.1, this output was called Surface Int Adjacent Air Temperature.

\subsubsection{Surface Inside Face Convection Heat Gain Rate {[}W{]}}\label{surface-inside-face-convection-heat-gain-rate-w}

\subsubsection{Surface Inside Face Convection Heat Gain Rate per Area {[}W/m2{]}}\label{surface-inside-face-convection-heat-gain-rate-per-area-wm2}

\subsubsection{Surface Inside Face Convection Heat Gain Energy {[}J{]}}\label{surface-inside-face-convection-heat-gain-energy-j}

These ``inside face convection heat gain'' output variables describe the heat transferred by convection between the inside face and the zone air. The values can be positive or negative with positive indicating heat is being added to the surface's face by convection. Different versions of the report are available including the basic heat gain rate (W), and a per unit area flux (W/m2), and an energy version (J).

Former Name: Prior to version 7.1, these outputs were called ``Surface Int Convection Heat *'' and had used the opposite sign convention.

\subsubsection{Surface Inside Face Convection Heat Transfer Coefficient {[}W/m2-K{]}}\label{surface-inside-face-convection-heat-transfer-coefficient-wm2-k}

This is the coefficient that describes the convection heat transfer. It is the value of ``Hc'' in the classic convection model Q = Hc* A* (T -- T). This is the result of the surface convection algorithm used for the inside face. Former Name: Prior to version 7.1, this output was called ``Surface Int Convection Coeff.''

Then Zone Opaque Surface Inside Faces Total Conduction Heat Loss Rate = \textbar{}550 -- 650\textbar{} = \textbar{}-100\textbar{} = 100 W.

For example, assume a zone has six opaque surfaces with Opaque Surface Outside Face Conduction values of 100, -200, 400, 50, 150 and --300 W. Then Zone Opaque Surface Outside Face Conduction = 700 - 500 = 200 W. Or if a zone has six opaque surfaces with Opaque Surface Outside Face Conduction values of -100, -200, 400, -50, 150 and --300W.

For Solar Distribution = FullInteriorAndExterior, this quantity can be non-zero for both floor and wall surfaces. Otherwise, for Solar Distribution = FullExterior or MinimalShadowing, it can be non-zero only for floor surfaces since in this case all entering beam solar is assumed to fall on the floor. Note that this variable will not be operational (have a real value) unless there are exterior windows in the zone.

\subsection{Window Output Variables}\label{window-output-variables-1}

The following output variables apply to subsurfaces that are windows or glass doors. These two subsurface types are called ``window'' here. ``Exterior window'' means that the base surface of the window is an exterior wall, floor, roof or ceiling (i.e., the base surface is a \hyperref[buildingsurfacedetailed]{BuildingSurface:Detailed} with OutsideFaceEnvironment = ExteriorEnvironment). ``Interior window'' means that the base surface of the window is an inter-zone wall, floor or ceiling. ``Glass'' means a transparent solid layer, usually glass, but possibly plastic or other transparent material. ``Shading device'' means an interior, exterior or between-glass shade or blind, or an exterior screen (only exterior windows can have a shading device).

\item
  {[}Convective heat flow to the zone from the zone side of the glazing{]}
\item

\item
  {[}Short-wave radiation from zone transmitted back out the window{]}

\subsubsection{Surface Window Net Heat Transfer Energy {[}J{]}}\label{surface-window-net-heat-transfer-rate-j}

The total heat flow through the glazing, frame and divider of an exterior window. Negative values imply heat flow to the exterior.

The important distinction between this output variable and those for ``Surface Window Heat Gain/Loss'' is that this represents the net heat flow through the window and not the heat flow \emph{to the zone}. The only difference is the heat flow \emph{to the zone} does not account for radiation from the opaque frame and divider components. This is because these components, as a simplification, do not participate in the overall radiative exchange with other surfaces in the zone.

For a window \emph{without an interior shading device}, this heat flow is equal to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {[}Surface Window Transmitted Solar Radiation Rate (see definition, above){]}
\item
  {[}Convective heat flow from the zone side of the glazing{]}
\item
  {[}Net IR heat flow from the zone side of the glazing{]}
\item
  {[}Short-wave radiation from zone transmitted back out the window{]}

See Figure~\ref{fig:vertical-exterior-window-showing-solar}.

For an exterior window of arbitrary tilt, it is defined as the angle between the window outward normal the projection of the sun's ray on the plane that contains the outward normal and is perpendicular to the ground.

If the sun is behind the window, the horizontal profile angle is not defined and is reported as 0.0.

Note that in most texts and in window equivalent layer model what we call ``horizontal profile angle'' is called ``vertical profile angle.''

\subsubsection{Surface Window Inside Face Glazing Condensation Status {[]}}\label{surface-window-inside-face-glazing-condensation-status}

A value of 1 means that moisture condensation will occur on the innermost glass face of an exterior window (i.e., on the glass face in contact with the zone air). Otherwise the value is 0. The condition for condensation is glass inside face temperature \textless{} zone air dewpoint temperature.

For airflow exterior windows, in which forced air passes between adjacent glass faces in double- and triple-pane windows, a value of 1 means that condensation will occur on one or both of the glass faces in contact with the airflow. In this case the condition for condensation is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{For airflow source = indoorair}, temperature of either face in contact with airflow \textless{} zone air dewpoint temperature.
\item
  \emph{For airflow source = outdoorair}, temperature of either face in contact with airflow \textless{} outside air dewpoint temperature.
\end{itemize}

As for regular windows, the value will also be 1 if condensation occurs on the innermost glass face.

\subsubsection{Surface Window Inside Face Frame Condensation Status {[]}}\label{surface-window-inside-face-frame-condensation-status}

\subsubsection{Surface Shading Device Is On Time Fraction {[]}}\label{surface-shading-device-is-on-time-fraction}

The fraction of time that a shading device is on an exterior window. For a particular simulation timestep, the value is 0.0 if the shading device is off (or there is no shading device) and the value is 1.0 if the shading device is on. (It is assumed that the shading device, if present, is either on or off for the entire timestep.) If the shading device is switchable glazing, a value of 0.0 means that the glazing is in the unswitched (light colored) state, and a value of 1.0 means that the glazing is in the switched (dark colored) state.

For a time interval longer a timestep, this is the fraction of the time interval that the shading device is on. For example, take the case where the time interval is one hour and the timestep is 10 minutes. Then if the shading device is on for two timesteps in the hour and off for the other four timesteps, then the fraction of time that the shading device is on = 2/6 = 0.3333.

If the slat angle is 90 deg, the slats are perpendicular to the glazing and the slats are said to be ``fully open''. See illustrations under \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}. For blinds with a fixed slat angle, the value reported here will be constant.

If the slat angle is -90 deg or 90 deg, the slats are parallel to the glazing and the slats are said to be ``closed''. If the slat angle is 0 deg, the slats are perpendicular to the glazing and the slats are said to be ``fully open''. For blinds with a fixed slat angle, the value reported here will be constant.

For an exterior window with a blind, this is the fraction of exterior beam solar radiation incident on the blind that is transmitted through the blind as beam solar radiation when the blind is isolated (i.e., as though the window glass were not present). Depends on various factors, including slat angle, width, separation, and thickness, and horizontal solar profile angle (for blinds with horizontal slats) or vertical solar profile angle (for blinds with vertical slats).

This value is the amount of inward reflection of solar beam off the screen material surface if the user specifies this modeling option (i.e., Material: WindowScreen, field Reflected Beam Transmittance Accounting Method = Model as Diffuse); otherwise, this value will be zero.

For an exterior window with a screen, the fraction of exterior diffuse solar radiation incident on the screen that is transmitted through the screen as diffuse solar radiation when the screen is isolated (i.e., as though the window glass were not present).

Depends on various factors, including the screen reflectance and the relative angle of the incident beam with respect to the screen. This value will include the amount of inward reflection of solar beam off the screen material surface if the user specifies this modeling option (i.e., Material: WindowScreen, field Reflected Beam Transmittance Accounting Method = Model as Direct Beam).

\subsubsection{Surface Window Transmitted Beam Solar Radiation Rate {[}W{]}}\label{surface-window-transmitted-beam-solar-radiation-rate-w-1}

\subsubsection{Surface Window Transmitted Beam Solar Radiation Energy {[}J{]}}\label{surface-window-transmitted-beam-solar-radiation-energy-j-1}

The beam solar radiation transmitted through an interior window. Calculated only if Solar Distribution = FullInteriorAndExterior in your Building input. The origin of this radiation is beam solar that enters through an exterior window in a zone and then passes through an interior window into the adjacent zone. The amount of this radiation depends on several factors, including sun position, intensity of beam solar incident on the exterior window (including effects of shadowing, if present), relative position of the exterior and interior window, and the size and transmittance of the windows. Note that if there are two or more exterior windows in a zone, then beam solar from one or more of them may pass through the same interior window. Likewise, if there are more than two or more interior windows in a zone then beam solar from a single exterior window may pass through one or more of the interior windows. There are both rate and energy versions of the output.

\subsubsection{Surface Storm Window On Off Status {[]}}\label{surface-storm-window-on-off-status}

Several reports can be selected for Surfaces. (See Group -- Report for details on how to specify). Examples are:

\subsubsection{DXF}\label{dxf}

This report produces a special file (\textbf{eplusout.dxf}) in the industry standard DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) for drawings. It is produced and accepted by many popular, commercial CAD programs. Detailed reference can be found on the AutoCAD\textsuperscript{TM} website at: \url{http://www.autodesk.com/techpubs/autocad/acadr14/dxf/index.htm}.

EnergyPlus produces this file from the Report command:

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Details, Vertices, DetailsWithVertices}\label{details-vertices-detailswithvertices}

This version of the report creates lines in the eplusout.eio file for each surface (except internal mass surfaces). Details of this reporting is shown in the Output Details and Examples document.

\subsection{Shading Surfaces}\label{shading-surfaces}

Shading surfaces are entities outside of the building that may cast shadows on the building's heat transfer surfaces. These entities do not typically have enough thermal mass to be described as part of the building's thermal makeup.

The most important effect of shading surfaces is to reduce solar gain in windows that are shadowed. (However, in some cases, shading surfaces can reflect solar onto a wall or window and increase solar gain.)

There are two kinds of shading surfaces in EnergyPlus: \textbf{detached} and \textbf{attached}. A \textbf{detached} shading surface, such as a tree or neighboring building, is not connected to the building. An \textbf{attached} shading surface is typically an overhang or fin that is attached to a particular base surface of the building, usually a wall; attached shading surfaces are usually designed to shade specific windows.

Objects for detached shading surfaces:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingsite-shadingbuilding]{Shading:Site}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingsite-shadingbuilding]{Shading:Building}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Site:Detailed}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Building:Detailed}
\end{itemize}

Similarly to the surfaces, the detailed objects use vertex entry whereas the other objects are limited to rectangular representation.

Objects for attached shading surfaces:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingoverhang]{Shading:Overhang}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingoverhangprojection]{Shading:Overhang:Projection}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingfin]{Shading:Fin}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingfinprojection]{Shading:Fin:Projection}
\item
  \hyperref[shadingzonedetailed-000]{Shading:Zone:Detailed}
\end{itemize}

EnergyPlus creates ``bi-directional'' shades from each shading surface entered. This means that the shade you input will cast a shadow no matter which side of the shade the sun is on. For example, a vertical fin will cast a shadow whether the sun is on the left side or right side of the fin. Prior to V1.0.2, a shading surface cast a shadow only in the hemisphere toward which the surface faced. This hemisphere is the one pointed to by the shading surface's outward normal vector, which is the cross product V23 x V21, where V23 is the vector from vertex 2 to vertex 3 of the shading surface and V21 is the vector from vertex 2 to vertex 1. Beginning with V1.0.2, the shades in EnergyPlus are ``bi-directional'' so that they can cast shadows in both hemispheres depending on the time-varying position of the sun relative to the shading surface.

It is important to note that EnergyPlus will automatically account for ``self-shading'' effects---such as in L-shaped buildings---in which some of the building's wall and roof surfaces shade other parts of the building, especially windows. This means that you only need to describe shading elements that aren't building heat-transfer surfaces.

Shading surfaces can also \textbf{reflect} solar radiation onto the building. This feature is simulated if you choose FullExteriorWithReflections or FullInteriorAndExteriorWithReflections in the Building object (ref: Building - Field: Solar Distribution). In this case, you may specify the reflectance properties of a shading surface with the \hyperref[shadingpropertyreflectance]{ShadingProperty:Reflectance} object. Note: If no \hyperref[shadingpropertyreflectance]{ShadingProperty:Reflectance} object is defined, then the shading surface reflectance values are assumed to be 0.2 and the fraction of shading surface that is glazed is assumed to be 0.0.

Shading surfaces also automatically shade diffuse solar radiation (and long-wave radiation) from the sky. And they will automatically shade diffuse solar radiation from the ground if Solar Distribution Field = FullExteriorWithReflections or FullInteriorAndExteriorWithReflections in the Building object. (If the reflections option for Solar Distribution is used, the program also takes into account the reduction of solar radiation reflected from the ground due to shading of the ground by shading surfaces and by the building itself.) Otherwise, shading surfaces will not shade diffuse radiation from the ground unless you enter a reduced value for View Factor to Ground for those building surfaces that are shaded (ref: \hyperref[buildingsurfacedetailed]{BuildingSurface:Detailed} - Field: View Factor to Ground and \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed} - Field: View Factor to Ground).

\subsection{Detached Shading Surfaces}\label{detached-shading-surfaces}

\subsection{Shading:Site, Shading:Building}\label{shadingsite-shadingbuilding}

These objects are used to describe rectangular shading elements that are external to the building. Examples are trees, high fences, near-by hills, and neighboring buildings.

If relative coordinates are used (ref: Field: Coordinate System in \hyperref[globalgeometryrules]{GlobalGeometryRules}), shading surfaces entered with \hyperref[shadingsite-shadingbuilding]{Shading:Site} remain stationary if the building is rotated, whereas those entered with \hyperref[shadingsite-shadingbuilding]{Shading:Building} rotate with the building. If world coordinates are used \hyperref[shadingsite-shadingbuilding]{Shading:Site} and \hyperref[shadingsite-shadingbuilding]{Shading:Building} are equivalent.

These shading elements are always opaque.

\subsubsection{Field: Name}\label{field-name-22-004}

This is a unique character string associated with the detached shading surface. Though it must be unique from other surface names, it is used primarily for convenience with detached shading surfaces.

\subsubsection{Field: Azimuth Angle}\label{field-azimuth-angle-10}

Theoretically, this should face to the surface it is shading (i.e.~if a south wall, this should be a north facing shade) but since EnergyPlus automatically generates the mirror image, the facing angle per se' is not so important.

\subsubsection{Field: Tilt Angle}\label{field-tilt-angle-10}

The tilt angle is the angle (in degrees) that the shade is tilted from horizontal (or the ground). Default for this field is 90 degrees.

\subsubsection{Starting Corner for the surface}\label{starting-corner-for-the-surface-16}

The rectangular surfaces specify the lower left corner of the surface for their starting coordinate. See the introductory paragraph for rules on this entry.

\subsubsection{Field: Starting X Coordinate}\label{field-starting-x-coordinate-16}

This field is the X coordinate (in meters).

\subsubsection{Field: Starting Y Coordinate}\label{field-starting-y-coordinate-10}

This field is the Y coordinate (in meters).

\subsubsection{Field: Starting Z Coordinate}\label{field-starting-z-coordinate-16}

This field is the Z coordinate (in meters).

\subsubsection{Field: Length}\label{field-length-16}

This field is the length of the shade in meters.

\subsubsection{Field: Height}\label{field-height-10}

This field is the width of the shade in meters.

Examples of these (can be found in example files 4ZoneWithShading\_Simple\_1.idf and 4ZoneWithShading\_Simple\_2.idf)

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Shading:Site:Detailed, Shading:Building:Detailed}\label{shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed}

These objects are used to describe shading elements that are external to the building. Examples are trees, high fences, near-by hills, and neighboring buildings.

If relative coordinates are used (ref: Field: Coordinate System in \hyperref[globalgeometryrules]{GlobalGeometryRules}), shading surfaces entered with \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Site:Detailed} remain stationary if the building is rotated, whereas those entered with \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Building:Detailed} rotate with the building. If world coordinates are used \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Site:Detailed} and \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Building:Detailed} are equivalent.

While ``detached'' implies that shading surfaces are not part of the building, the detached shading sequence can be used to describe attached shading surfaces that may shade heat transfer surfaces in more than one zone. For example, wing A of a building might shade several zones of wing B but wing A (for whatever reason) is not described in the geometry for the simulation so it is represented by a detached shade to get its shadowing effect.

\subsubsection{Field: Name}\label{field-name-23-004}

This is a unique character string associated with the detached shading surface. Though it must be unique from other surface names, it is used primarily for convenience with detached shading surfaces.

\subsubsection{Field: Transmittance Schedule Name}\label{field-transmittance-schedule-name}

The name of a schedule of solar transmittance values from 0.0 to 1.0 for the shading surface. If a blank is entered in this field, the transmittance value defaults to 0.0, i.e., the shading surface is opaque at all times. This scheduling can be used to allow for seasonal transmittance change, such as for deciduous trees that have a higher transmittance in winter than in summer. Transmittance based on time of day can also be used---a movable awning, for example, where the transmittance is some value less than 1.0 when the awning is in place and is 1.0 when the awning is retracted.

The following assumptions are made in the shading surface transmittance calculation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Both sides of the shading surface have the same transmittance properties.
\item
  The transmittance is the same for both beam and diffuse solar radiation.
\item
  Beam solar transmittance is independent of angle of incidence on the shading surface.
\item
  Beam radiation incident on a shading surface is transmitted as beam radiation with no change in direction, i.e., there is no beam-to-diffuse component.
\item
  If two shading surfaces with non-zero transmittance overlap, the net transmittance is the product of the individual transmittances. Inter-reflection between the shading surfaces (and between the shading surfaces and the building) is ignored.
\item
  For the daylighting calculation (ref: Group -- Daylighting) the shading surface's visible transmittance is assumed to be the same as its solar transmittance.
\item
  Shading devices are assumed to be opaque to long-wave radiation no matter what the solar transmittance value is.
\end{itemize}

Note that shading devices only shade solar radiation when the sun is up, which is automatically determined by EnergyPlus from latitude, time of year, etc. The user need only account for the time-varying transmittance of the shading device in the transmittance schedule, not whether the sun is up or not.

\subsubsection{Field: Number Vertices}\label{field-number-vertices}

The number of sides in the surface (number of X,Y,Z vertex groups). For further information, see the discussion on ``Surface Vertices'' above.

\subsection{Shading:Zone:Detailed}\label{shadingzonedetailed-000}

This object is used to describe attached ``subsurfaces'' such as overhangs, wings or fins that project outward from a base surface. This classification is used for convenience; actually, a device of this type can cast shadows on the surface to which it is attached as well as on adjacent surfaces. For example, a fin may shade its parent wall as well as adjacent walls.

Note that a zone surface can cast shadows on other zone surfaces. However, you don't have to worry about such effects---for example, one wall of an L-shaped building shading another wall--because EnergyPlus will automatically check for this kind of ``self shadowing'' and do the proper calculations.

Unlike attached (or detached) shading surfaces, building surfaces can only cast shadows in the hemisphere towards which they face. This means, for example, that a roof that faces \emph{upward} will not cast a shadow \emph{downward}. (Thus, specifying an oversized roof in an attempt to account for the shading effects of overhangs will \emph{not} work). Interior surfaces do not cast shadows of any kind.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-30-002}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-28-002}

This is the name of the attached shading surface. It must be different from other surface names.

\paragraph{Field: Base Surface Name}\label{field-base-surface-name}

This is the name of the surface to which this shading device is attached. This surface can be a wall (or roof) but not a window or door.

\paragraph{Field: Transmittance Schedule Name}\label{field-transmittance-schedule-name-1}

The name of a schedule of solar transmittance values from 0.0 to 1.0 for the shading surface. If a blank is entered in this field, the transmittance value defaults to 0.0, i.e., the shading surface is opaque at all times. This scheduling can be used to allow for seasonal transmittance change, such as for deciduous trees that have a higher transmittance in winter than in summer. Transmittance based on time of day can also be used---a movable awning, for example, where the transmittance is some value less than 1.0 when the awning is in place and is 1.0 when the awning is retracted.

The following assumptions are made in the shading surface transmittance calculation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Both sides of the shading surface have the same transmittance properties.
\item
  The transmittance is the same for both beam and diffuse solar radiation.
\item
  Beam solar transmittance is independent of angle of incidence on the shading surface.
\item
  Beam radiation incident on a shading surface is transmitted as beam radiation with no change in direction, i.e., there is no beam-to-diffuse component.
\item
  If two shading surfaces with non-zero transmittance overlap, the net transmittance is the product of the individual transmittances. Inter-reflection between the shading surfaces (and between the shading surfaces and the building) is ignored.
\item
  For the daylighting calculation (ref: Group -- Daylighting) the shading surface's visible transmittance is assumed to be the same as its solar transmittance.
\item
  Shading devices are assumed to be opaque to long-wave radiation no matter what the solar transmittance value is.
\end{itemize}

Note that shading devices only shade solar radiation when the sun is up, which is automatically determined by EnergyPlus from latitude, time of year, etc. The user need only account for the time-varying transmittance of the shading device in the transmittance schedule, not whether the sun is up or not.

\paragraph{Field: Number Vertices}\label{field-number-vertices-1}

The number of sides in the surface (number of X,Y,Z vertex groups). For further information, see the discussion on ``Surface Vertices'' above. The example below shows the correct input for an overhang (to shade the appropriate portion of the base wall and window).

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 33

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image059.png}
\caption{Illustration for Attached Shading Surface \protect \label{fig:illustration-for-attached-shading-surface}}
\end{figure}

Proper specification for this overhang (facing up) is:

4,(C,0,D),(C,-B,D),(C+A,-B,D),(C+A,0,D); () used to illustrate each vertex.

\begin{callout}
Note that for horizontal surfaces, any corner may be chosen as the starting corner. The order of vertices determines whether the surface is facing up or down. Shading surfaces are mirrored automatically unless the user specifies ``DoNotMirrorDetachedShading'', so each shading surface need only be described once.
\end{callout}

Thus, another shading surface will be created (facing down):

4,(C+A,-B,D),(C+A,0,D),(C,0,D),(C,-B,D);

\subsection{ShadingProperty:Reflectance}\label{shadingpropertyreflectance}

Specifies the reflectance properties of a shading surface when the solar reflection calculation has requested, i.e., when if ``WithReflections'' option is chosen in the Building object (ref: Building - Field: Solar Distribution). It is assumed that shading surfaces are divided into an unglazed, diffusely reflecting portion and a glazed, specularly-reflecting portion, either of which may be zero. The reflectance properties are assumed to be the same on both sides of the shading surface.

Note that a shadowing transmittance schedule (ref: Shading Surfaces, Field: Transmittance Schedule Name) can be used with a reflective shading surface. However, EnergyPlus assumes that the reflectance properties of the shading surface are constant even if the transmittance varies.

If no ShadingProperty:Reflectance objects are entered, the default values shown here will be used for shading surfaces. Other surfaces have their reflectance properties defined by the materials in the outer layers of the constructions.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-31-002}

\paragraph{Field: Shading Surface Name}\label{field-shading-surface-name}

The name of the \hyperref[shadingsite-shadingbuilding]{Shading:Site}, \hyperref[shadingsite-shadingbuilding]{Shading:Building}, \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Site:Detailed}, \hyperref[shadingsitedetailed-shadingbuildingdetailed]{Shading:Building:Detailed}, \hyperref[shadingoverhang]{Shading:Overhang}, \hyperref[shadingoverhangprojection]{Shading:Overhang:Projection}, \hyperref[shadingfin]{Shading:Fin}, \hyperref[shadingfinprojection]{Shading:Fin:Projection} or \hyperref[shadingzonedetailed-000]{Shading:Zone:Detailed} object to which the following fields apply.

If this ShadingProperty:Reflectance object is not defined for a shading surface the default values listed in each of the following fields will be used in the solar reflection calculation.

\paragraph{Field: Diffuse Solar Reflectance of Unglazed Part of Shading Surface}\label{field-diffuse-solar-reflectance-of-unglazed-part-of-shading-surface}

The diffuse solar reflectance of the unglazed part of the shading surface (default = 0.2). This reflectance is assumed to be the same for beam-to-diffuse and diffuse-to-diffuse reflection. Beam-to-diffuse reflection is assumed to be independent of angle of incidence of beam radiation. Diffuse-to-diffuse reflection is assumed to be independent of angular distribution of the incident of diffuse radiation. The outgoing diffuse radiation is assumed to be isotropic (hemispherically uniform).

The sum of this reflectance and the shading surface transmittance should be less than or equal to 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Diffuse Visible Reflectance of Unglazed Part of Shading Surface}\label{field-diffuse-visible-reflectance-of-unglazed-part-of-shading-surface}

The diffuse visible reflectance of the unglazed part of the shading surface (default = 0.2). This reflectance is assumed to be the same for beam-to-diffuse and diffuse-to-diffuse reflection. Beam-to-diffuse reflection is assumed to be independent of angle of incidence of beam radiation. Diffuse-to-diffuse reflection is assumed to be independent of angular distribution of the incident of diffuse radiation. The outgoing diffuse radiation is assumed to be isotropic (hemispherically uniform).

This value if used only for the daylighting calculation (ref: \hyperref[daylightingcontrols-000]{Daylighting:Controls}). The sum of this reflectance and the shading surface transmittance should be less than or equal to 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction of Shading Surface That Is Glazed}\label{field-fraction-of-shading-surface-that-is-glazed}

The fraction of the area of the shading surface that consists of windows (default = 0.0). It is assumed that the windows are evenly distributed over the surface and have the same glazing construction (see following ``Name of Glazing Construction''). This might be the case, for example, for reflection from the façade of a neighboring, highly-glazed building. For the reflection calculation the possible presence of shades, screens or blinds on the windows of the shading surface is ignored. Beam-to-beam (specular) reflection is assumed to occur only from the glazed portion of the shading surface. This reflection depends on angle of incidence as determined by the program from the glazing construction. Beam-to-diffuse reflection from the glazed portion is assumed to be zero. The diffuse-to-diffuse reflectance of the glazed portion is determined by the program from the glazing construction.

\paragraph{Field: Glazing Construction Name}\label{field-glazing-construction-name}

The name of the construction of the windows on the shading surface. Required if Fraction of Shading Surface That Is Glazed is greater than 0.0.

\subsection{WindowShadingControl}\label{windowpropertyshadingcontrol}

Window shading with coverings like drapes, blinds, screens or pull-down shades can be used to reduce the amount of solar radiation entering the window or reduce daylighting glare. It can also be used to reduce heat loss through the window (movable insulation). Leaving the window covering open in the winter can maximize solar heat gain and thereby reduce heating loads.

With WindowShadingControl you specify the type,  location, and timing of the shading device, what variable or combination of variables controls deployment of the shading device, and what the control setpoint is. If the shading device is a blind, you also specify how the slat angle is controlled. Each WindowShadingControl object is associated with a zone and has a list of one or more windows and glass doors to which the shading control is applied (ref: \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed} with Type = Window or GlassDoor, Window, and \hyperref[glazeddoor]{GlazedDoor}).

NOTE: WindowShadingControl does not work with complex fenestration systems. Controlled complex fenestration systems can be made only with Energy Management Systems objects. Refrencing a \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed} in a WindowShadingControl while using complex fenestration systems will be ignored by program.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:allowed-locations-of-a-window-shading-device.}, a shading device can be inside the window (Shading Type = InteriorShade or InteriorBlind), outside the window (Shading Type = ExteriorShade or ExteriorBlind), or between panes of glass (Shading Type = BetweenGlassShade or BetweenGlassBlind). The exception is window screens which can only be outside the window (Shading Type = ExteriorScreen).

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 34
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image060.png}
\caption{Allowed locations of a window shading device. \protect \label{fig:allowed-locations-of-a-window-shading-device.}}
\end{figure}

When a shading device is present it is either retracted or activated. When it is retracted it covers none of the window. When it is activated it covers the entire glazed part of the window (but not the frame). Whether the shading device is retracted or activated in a particular timestep depends on the control mechanism: see ``Shading Control Type,'' below. To model a case in which the shading device, when activated, covers only \textbf{part} of the window you will have to divide the window into two separate windows, one with the shading device and one without the shading device.

A shading device can also be of a kind in which the optical properties of the glazing switch from one set of values to another in order to increase or decrease solar or visible transmittance (Shading Type = SwitchableGlazing).

There are two ways of specifying the actual shading device:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
\textbf{Specify ``Name of Construction with Shading''}

This is the name of a window Construction that has the shading device as one of its layers. The thermal and solar-optical properties of the shading device are given by the shading material referenced in that Construction (ref: Construction, \hyperref[windowmaterialshade]{WindowMaterial:Shade}, \hyperref[windowmaterialscreen]{WindowMaterial:Screen} and \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}). To use this method you have to define two Constructions for the window, one without the shading device and one with it. See Example 1, below.

The Construction without the shading device is referenced in the \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed} input for the window (see IDF example, below). The Construction with the shading device is referenced by the window's WindowShadingControl.

For Shading Type = InteriorShade, InteriorBlind, ExteriorShade, ExteriorScreen and ExteriorBlind these two Constructions must be identical expect for the presence of the shading layer in the shaded Construction, otherwise you will get an error message. You will also get an error message if the Construction referenced by the window has a shading layer.

  \item
\textbf{Specify the ``Material Name of the Shading Device''}

This is the name of a \hyperref[windowmaterialshade]{WindowMaterial:Shade}, \hyperref[windowmaterialscreen]{WindowMaterial:Screen} or \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}. This method can be used with Shading Type = InteriorShade, InteriorBlind, ExteriorShade and ExteriorBlind. It cannot be used with Shading Type = BetweenGlassShade, BetweenGlassBlind, or SwitchableGlazing. If Shading Type = InteriorShade or ExteriorShade, then you specify the name of a \hyperref[windowmaterialshade]{WindowMaterial:Shade}. If Shading Type = InteriorBlind or ExteriorBlind, then you specify the name of a \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}. If Shading Type = ExteriorScreen, then you specify the name of a \hyperref[windowmaterialscreen]{WindowMaterial:Screen}. See Example 2, below. This method is simpler to use since you don't have to specify two Constructions that differ only by the shading layer.

When this method is used, the program will automatically create a shaded window construction by adding a shading layer to the outside or inside of the construction corresponding to the windows referenced by the WindowShadingControl. The name, created by the program, of this shaded construction is composed as follows: if the name of the window construction is CCC and the material name of the shading device is DDD, then the shaded construction name is CCC:DDD:INT for an interior shading device and CCC:DDD:EXT for an exterior shading device.

This method is the required if you want to add a shading device to a construction brought in from a WINDOW Data File (ref:\hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile}).

Note that if both ``Name of Construction with Shading'' and ``Material Name of Shading Device'' are specified, the former takes precedence.
\end{itemize}

Most Shading Control Types allow you to specify a schedule that determines when the control is active. One example is a control that is active seasonally. For example, to deploy shading only in the summer when the incident solar is high enough, use Shading Control Type = OnIfHighSolarOnWindow with a schedule that is 1 during the summer months and 0 otherwise and specify Shading Control Is Scheduled = YES. 

To deploy one shading device during one time period and another during another time period for the same window, specify two different WindowShadingControl objects that both reference the same fenestration.  Each of the WindowShadingControl input objects would include the same window on their lists of fenestration objects, but would reference different schedule input objects. The referenced schedule input objects should have non-zero values specified at different times for each WindowShadingControl. This approach can be used to add shading that is different for different seasons. When more than one WindowShadingControl is used for the same window based on schedule, the type of shading, control type, setpoints, and several other parameters must be the same in the different WindowShadingControl objects, but the shading device and construction can be different.

In addition, most Shading Control Types also allow you to specify that glare control is active in addition to the specified Control Type. For example, you might want to deploy shading when the solar incident on a window is too high OR the glare from the window is too high. This type of joint control requires that the window be in a daylit zone, that the maximum allowed glare be specified in the Daylighting object for the zone, and that Glare Control Is Active = YES in WindowShadingControl.

If Shading Type = InteriorBlind, ExteriorBlind or BetweenGlassBlind you can use WindowShadingControl to specify how the slat angle of the blind is controlled when the blind is in place.

A special type of WindowShadingControl is SwitchableGlazing. An example is electrochromic glazing in which the transmittance and reflectance of the glass is controlled electronically. For example, you could have electrochromic glazing switch from clear (high transmittance) to dark (low transmittance) to control solar gain. If you choose the Shading Type = SwitchableGlazing option for WindowShadingControl, the unswitched (clear) state is specified by the Construction referenced by the window and the switched (dark) state is specified by the Construction referenced by WindowShadingControl for that window. For example, if you specify Shading Type = SwitchableGlazing and Shading Control Type = OnIfHighSolarOnWindow, then the glazing will switch to the dark state whenever the solar radiation striking the window exceeds the Setpoint value.

For Shading Type = SwitchableGlazing the state of the window is either clear (unswitched) or dark (fully switched) for all Shading Control Types except MeetDaylightIlluminanceSetpoint. In this case, the transmittance of the glazing is adjusted to just meet the daylight illuminance set point at the first daylighting reference point (see Daylighting). This type of control assures that there is just enough solar gain to meet the daylighting requirements in a zone, and no more, thus reducing the cooling load.

To specify the order of when shades are deployed, the two different approaches can be used:

- If shades for each window are independently controlled, than a single WindowShadingControl object should be used and the Multiple Surface Control Type field should be set to Sequential. The windows should be specified in the Fenestration Surface N Name fields in the order that they should be deployed. The Shading Control Sequence Number field is not used being used since only one WindowShadingControl is used so it can be set to any value or left blank.

- If shades for a group of windows are deployed together and shades for another group of windows are deployed after that, than multiple WindowShadingControl objects should be used. Each WindowShadingControl should have Multiple Surface Control Type field should be set to Group and the names of each window in the group should be specified in the Fenestration Surface N Name fields. The Shading Control Sequence Number in the  WindowShadingControl object that controls the first group of shades should be set to 1. The Shading Control Sequence Number in the  WindowShadingControl object that controls the second group of shades should be set to 2. Any number of additional groups of shades can be added and Shading Control Sequence Number can be incremented by one for each group.

It is possible to mix these two approaches. For example, if first a group of shades is controlled together followed by a sequence of individual windows than these approaches can be combined with the Multiple Surface Control Type field should be set to Sequential in the second WindowShadingControl object.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-32-001}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-29-001}

Name of the window shading control.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name}\label{field-zone-name-29-001}

Name of the zone where this shading control is used.

\paragraph{Field: Shading Control Sequence Number}\label{shading-control-sequence-number}

If multiple WindowShadingControl objects are used in the same zone, then the order that they deploy the window shades can be set with this field. The first WindowShadingControl should be 1 and subsequent WindowShadingControl should 2, 3, etc. This is usually used when the Multiple Surface Control Type field is set to Group to control groups of windows in a certain order.

\paragraph{Field: Shading Type}\label{field-shading-type}

The type of shading device. The choices are:

\emph{InteriorShade}: A diffusing shade is on the inside of the window. (In the shaded Construction the shading layer must be a \hyperref[windowmaterialshade]{WindowMaterial:Shade}.)

\emph{ExteriorShade}: A diffusing shade is on the outside of the window. (In the shaded Construction the shading layer must be a \hyperref[windowmaterialshade]{WindowMaterial:Shade}.)

\emph{BetweenGlassShade}: A diffusing shade is between two glass layers. (In the shaded Construction the shading layer must be a \hyperref[windowmaterialshade]{WindowMaterial:Shade}.) This shading type is allowed only for double- and triple-glazing. For triple-glazing the shade must be between the two inner glass layers.

\emph{ExteriorScreen}: An insect screen is on the outside of the window. (In the shaded Construction the shading layer must be a \hyperref[windowmaterialscreen]{WindowMaterial:Screen}.)

\emph{InteriorBlind}: A slat-type shading device, such as a Venetian blind, is on the inside of the window. (In the shaded Construction the shading layer must be a \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}.)

\emph{ExteriorBlind}: A slat-type shading device is on the outside of the window. (In the shaded Construction the shading layer must be a \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}.)

\emph{BetweenGlassBlind}: A slat-type shading device is between two glass layers. (In the shaded Construction the shading layer must be a \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}.) This shading type is allowed only for double- and triple-glazing. For triple-glazing the blind must be between the two inner glass layers.

\emph{SwitchableGlazing}: Shading is achieved by changing the characteristics of the window glass, such as by darkening it.

\paragraph{Field: Construction with Shading Name}\label{field-construction-with-shading-name}

Name of the window Construction that has the shading in place. The properties of the shading device are given by the shading material referenced in that Construction (ref: Construction, \hyperref[windowmaterialshade]{WindowMaterial:Shade}, \hyperref[windowmaterialscreen]{WindowMaterial:Screen} and \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}). For Shading Type = SwitchableGlazing, this is the name of the Construction that corresponds to the window in its fully-switched (darkest) state.

Specifying ``Name of Construction with Shading'' is required if Shading Type = BetweenGlassShade, BetweenGlassBlind, or SwitchableGlazing. For other Shading Types, you may alternatively specify ``Material Name of Shading Device'' (see below).

\paragraph{Field: Shading Control Type}\label{field-shading-control-type}

Specifies how the shading device is controlled, i.e., it determines whether the shading device is ``on'' or ``off.'' For blinds, screens and shades, when the device is ``on'' it is assumed to cover all of the window except its frame; when the device is ``off'' it is assumed to cover none of the window (whether ``on'' or ``off'' the shading device is assumed to cover none of the wall that the window is on).

For switchable glazing, ``on'' means that the glazing is in the fully-switched state and ``off'' means that it is in the unswitched state; for example, for electrochromic glazing, ``on'' means the glazing is in its darkest state and ``off'' means it is in its lightest state.

The choices for Shading Control Type are the following. If SetPoint is applicable its units are shown in parentheses.

\emph{AlwaysOn}: Shading is always on.

\emph{AlwaysOff}: Shading is always off.

The following six control types are used primarily to reduce zone cooling load due to window solar gain.

\emph{OnIfScheduleAllows}: Shading is on if schedule value is non-zero. Requires that Schedule Name be specified and Shading Control Is Scheduled = Yes.

Note: For exterior window screens \emph{AlwaysOn, AlwaysOff, and OnIfScheduleAllows} are the only valid shading control types.

\emph{OnIfHighSolarOnWindow}: Shading is on if beam plus diffuse solar radiation incident on the window exceeds SetPoint (W/m\(^{2}\)) and schedule, if specified, allows shading.

\emph{OnIfHighHorizontalSolar}: Shading is on if total (beam plus diffuse) horizontal solar irradiance exceeds SetPoint (W/m\(^{2}\)) and schedule, if specified, allows shading.

\emph{OnIfHighOutdoorAirTemperature}: Shading is on if outside air temperature exceeds SetPoint (C) and schedule, if specified, allows shading.

\emph{OnIfHighZoneAirTemperature}: Shading is on if zone air temperature in the previous timestep exceeds SetPoint (C) and schedule, if specified, allows shading.

\emph{OnIfHighZoneCooling}: Shading is on if zone cooling rate in the previous timestep exceeds SetPoint (W) and schedule, if specified, allows shading.

\emph{OnIfHighGlare}: Shading is on if the total daylight glare index at the zone's first daylighting reference point from all of the exterior windows in the zone exceeds the maximum glare index specified in the daylighting input for zone (ref: Group -- Daylighting). Applicable only to windows in zones with daylighting.

Note: Unlike other Shading Control Types, glare control is active whether or not a schedule is specified.

\emph{MeetDaylightIlluminanceSetpoint}: Used only with ShadingType = SwitchableGlazing in zones with daylighting controls. In this case the transmittance of the glazing is adjusted to just meet the daylight illuminance set point at the first daylighting reference point. Note that the daylight illuminance set point is specified in the \hyperref[daylightingcontrols-000]{Daylighting:Controls} object for the Zone; it is not specified as a WindowShadingControl SetPoint. When the glare control is active, if meeting the daylight illuminance set point at the first daylighting reference point results in higher discomfort glare index (DGI) than the specified zone's maximum allowable DGI for either of the daylight reference points, the glazing will be further dimmed until the DGI equals the specified maximum allowable value.

The following three control types can be used to reduce zone heating load during the winter by reducing window conductive heat loss at night and leaving the window unshaded during the day to maximize solar gain. They are applicable to any Shading Type except ExteriorScreen but are most appropriate for interior or exterior shades with high insulating value (``movable insulation''). ``Night'' means the sun is down and ``day'' means the sun is up.

\emph{OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOffDay}: Shading is on at night if the outside air temperature is less than SetPoint (C) and schedule, if specified, allows shading. Shading is off during the day.

\emph{OnNightIfLowInsideTempAndOffDay}: Shading is on at night if the zone air temperature in the previous timestep is less than SetPoint (C) and schedule, if specified, allows shading. Shading is off during the day.

\emph{OnNightIfHeatingAndOffDay}: Shading is on at night if the zone heating rate in the previous timestep exceeds SetPoint (W) and schedule, if specified, allows shading. Shading is off during the day.

The following two control types can be used to reduce zone heating and cooling load. They are applicable to any Shading Type except ExteriorScreen but are most appropriate for translucent interior or exterior shades with high insulating value (``translucent movable insulation'').

\emph{OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOnDayIfCooling}: Shading is on at night if the outside air temperature is less than SetPoint (C). Shading is on during the day if the zone cooling rate in the previous timestep is non-zero. Night and day shading is subject to schedule, if specified.

\emph{OnNightIfHeatingAndOnDayIfCooling}: Shading is on at night if the zone heating rate in the previous timestep exceeds SetPoint (W). Shading is on during the day if the zone cooling rate in the previous timestep is non-zero. Night and day shading is subject to schedule, if specified.

The following control types can be used to reduce zone cooling load. They are applicable to any Shading Type except ExteriorScreen but are most appropriate for interior or exterior blinds, interior or exterior shades with low insulating value, or switchable glazing.

\emph{OffNightAndOnDayIfCoolingAndHighSolarOnWindow}: Shading is off at night. Shading is on during the day if the solar radiation incident on the window exceeds SetPoint (W/m\(^{2}\)) and if the zone cooling rate in the previous timestep is non-zero. Daytime shading is subject to schedule, if specified.

\emph{OnNightAndOnDayIfCoolingAndHighSolarOnWindow}: Shading is on at night. Shading is on during the day if the solar radiation incident on the window exceeds SetPoint (W/m\(^{2}\)) and if the zone cooling rate in the previous timestep is non-zero. Day and night shading is subject to schedule, if specified. (This Shading Control Type is the same as the previous one, except the shading is on at night rather than off.)

\emph{OnIfHighOutdoorAirTempAndHighSolarOnWindow:} Shading is on if the outside air temperature exceeds the Setpoint (C) and if the solar radiation incident on the window exceeds SetPoint 2 (W/m\(^{2}\)).

\emph{OnIfHighOutdoorAirTempAndHighHorizontalSolar:} Shading is on if the outside air temperature exceeds the Setpoint (C) and if the horizontal solar radiation exceeds SetPoint 2 (W/m\(^{2}\)).

\emph{OnIfHighZoneAirTempAndHighSolarOnWindow:} Shading is on if the zone air temperature exceeds the Setpoint (C) and if the solar radiation incident on the window exceeds SetPoint 2 (W/m\(^{2}\)).

\emph{OnIfHighZoneAirTempAndHighHorizontalSolar:} Shading is on if the zone air temperature exceeds the Setpoint (C) and if the horizontal solar radiation exceeds SetPoint 2 (W/m\(^{2}\)).

\paragraph{Field: Schedule Name}\label{field-schedule-name-007}

Required if Shading Control Is Scheduled = Yes. If schedule value \textgreater{} 0 , shading control is active, i.e., shading can be on only if the shading control test passes. If schedule value = 0, shading is off whether or not the control test passes. If Schedule Name is not specified, shading control is assumed to be active at all times.

\paragraph{Field: Setpoint}\label{field-setpoint}

The setpoint for activating window shading. The units depend on the type of trigger:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  W/m\(^{2}\) for solar-based controls
\item
  W for cooling- or heating-based controls
\item
  Degrees C for temperature-based controls
\end{itemize}

SetPoint is unused for Shading Control Type = OnIfScheduleAllows, OnIfHighGlare and DaylightIlluminance.

\paragraph{Field: Shading Control Is Scheduled}\label{field-shading-control-is-scheduled}

Accepts values YES and NO. The default is NO. Not applicable for Shading Control Type = OnIfHighGlare and should be blank in that case.

If YES, Schedule Name is required and that schedule determines whether the shading control specified by Shading Control Type is active or inactive (see Schedule Name, above).

If NO, Schedule Name is not applicable (should be blank) and the shading control is unscheduled.

Shading Control Is Scheduled = YES is required if Shading Control Type = OnIfScheduleAllows.

\paragraph{Field: Glare Control Is Active}\label{field-glare-control-is-active}

Accepts values YES and NO. The default is NO.

If YES and the window is in a daylit zone, shading is on if the zone's discomfort glare index exceeds the maximum discomfort glare index specified in the Daylighting object referenced by the zone. For switchable windows with \emph{MeetDaylightIlluminanceSetpoint} shading control, if Glare Control is active, the windows are always continuously dimmed as necessary to meet the zone's maximum allowable DGI while providing appropriate amount of daylight for the zone.

The glare test is OR'ed with the test specified by Shading Control Type. For example, if Glare Control Is Active = YES and Shading Control Type = OnIfHighZoneAirTemp, then shading is on if glare is too high OR if the zone air temperature is too high.

Glare Control Is Active = YES is required if Shading Control Type = OnIfHighGlare.

\paragraph{Field: Shading Device Material Name}\label{field-shading-device-material-name}

The name of a \hyperref[windowmaterialshade]{WindowMaterial:Shade}, \hyperref[windowmaterialscreen]{WindowMaterial:Screen} or \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}. Required if ``Name of Construction with Shading'' is not specified. Not applicable if Shading Type = BetweenGlassShade, BetweenGlassBlind or SwitchableGlazing and should be blank in this case. If both ``Name of Construction with Shading'' and ``Material Name of Shading Device'' are entered the former takes precedence.

\paragraph{Field: Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds}\label{field-type-of-slat-angle-control-for-blinds}

Applies only to Shading Type = InteriorBlind, ExteriorBlind or BetweenGlassBlind. Specifies how the slat angle is controlled. The choices are FixedSlatAngle, ScheduledSlatAngle and BlockBeamSolar.

If FixedSlatAngle (the default), the angle of the slat is fixed at the value input for the \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind} that is contained in the construction specified by Name of Construction with Shading or is specified by Material Name of Shading Device.

If ScheduledSlatAngle, the slat angle varies according to the schedule specified by Slat Angle Schedule Name, below.

If BlockBeamSolar, the slat angle is set each timestep to just block beam solar radiation. If there is no beam solar on the window the slat angle is set to the value input for the \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind} that is contained in the construction specified by Name of Construction with Shading or is specified by Material Name of Shading Device. The BlockBeamSolar option prevents beam solar from entering the window and causing possible unwanted glare if the beam falls on work surfaces while at the same time allowing near-optimal indirect radiation for daylighting.

\paragraph{Field: Slat Angle Schedule Name}\label{field-slat-angle-schedule-name}

This is the name of a schedule of slat angles that is used when Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds = ScheduledSlatAngle. You should be sure that the schedule values fall within the range given by the Minimum Slat Angle and Maximum Slat Angle values entered in the corresponding \hyperref[windowmaterialblind]{WindowMaterial:Blind}. If not, the program will force them into this range.

\paragraph{Field: Setpoint 2}\label{field-setpoint-2}

Used only as the second setpoint for the following setpoint control types: OnIfHighOutdoorAirTempAndHighSolarOnWindow, OnIfHighOutdoorAirTempAndHighHorizontalSolar, OnIfHighZoneAirTempAndHighSolarOnWindow, and OnIfHighZoneAirTempAndHighHorizontalSolar

\paragraph{Field: Daylighting Controls Object Name}\label{field-daylighting-controls-object-name}

Name of the \hyperref[daylightingcontrols-000]{Daylighting:Controls} object that provides the glare and illuminance control to the zone.

\paragraph{Field: Multiple Surface Control Type}\label{field-multiple-surface-control-type}

The field can have one of two options:

\emph{Sequential}: The following list of fenestration surfaces are controlled individually in the order specified.

\emph{Group}: The entire list of fenestration surfaces is controlled simultaneously, and if glare control is needed, the entire group of window shades are deployed together a the same time.

\paragraph{Field: Fenestration Surface <n> Name}\label{field-fenestration-surface1-name}

The name of a \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed}, Window, or \hyperref[glazeddoor]{GlazedDoor} object controlled by this WindowShadingControl. This field can be repeated to apply the same shading control to more than one fenestration surface. When Multiple Surface Control Type is set to Sequential, the order of the Fenestration Surface Names is the order that the shades will be deployed. The object is extensible so additional fields of fenestration surface names can be added to the object. All of the fenestration surfaces must be either in the zone specified in the Zone Name field or in an adjacent zone connected by an interior window.

An IDF example: window with interior roll shade that is deployed when solar incident on the window exceeds 50 W/m\(^{2}\).

\subsection{WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider}\label{windowpropertyframeanddivider}

The WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider object is referenced by exterior windows that have

\begin{itemize}
\item
  a frame, and/or
\item
  a divider, and/or
\item
  reveal surfaces that reflect beam solar radiation.
\end{itemize}

A \textbf{\emph{frame}} surrounds the glazing in a window (see Figure~\ref{fig:a-window-with-a-frame-and-divider.} and Figure~\ref{fig:illustration-showing-frame-and-divider}). It is assumed that all frame characteristics---such as width, conductance and solar absorptance---are the same for the top, bottom and side elements of the frame. If the frame elements are not the same then you should enter area-weighted average values for the frame characteristics.

The window vertices that you specify in the \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed} object are those of the glazed part of the window, not the frame. EnergyPlus automatically subtracts the area of the frame---determined from the glazing dimensions and the frame width---from the area of the wall containing the window.

A \textbf{\emph{divider}}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:a-window-with-a-frame-and-divider.}, Figure~\ref{fig:illustration-showing-frame-and-divider} and Figure~\ref{fig:illustration-showing-divider-types.}, divides the glazing up into separate lites. It is assumed that all divider elements have the same characteristics. If not, area-weighted average values should be used. EnergyPlus automatically subtracts the divider area from the glazed area of the window.

\textbf{\emph{Reveal surfaces}}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:a-vertical-section-through-a-window-with}, are associated with the setback of the glazing from the outside and/or inside surface of the parent wall. If the depth and solar absorptance of these surfaces are specified, the program will calculate the reflection of beam solar radiation from these surfaces. The program also calculates the shadowing (onto the window) of beam and diffuse solar radiation by outside reveal surfaces.

In EnergyPlus, a window can have any combination of frame, divider and reveal surfaces, or none of these.

The best source of frame and divider characteristics is the WINDOW program, which will calculate the values required by EnergyPlus for different frame and divider types. In particular, the THERM program within the WINDOW program will calculate the effective conductance of frames and dividers; this is the conductance taking 2-D heat transfer effects into account.

Note that a window's frame and divider characteristics, along with other window information, can be read in from the Window Data File (see ``Importing Windows from the WINDOW program'' and ``\hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile} object''). In this case the WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider referenced by the window is not applicable and should be blank unless you want to specify reveal surfaces for beam solar reflection.

In the illustration above, the divider has two horizontal elements and one vertical element.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-33-001}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-30-001}

The name of the frame/divider object. It is referenced by WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider Name in \hyperref[fenestrationsurfacedetailed]{FenestrationSurface:Detailed}.

\textbf{\emph{Frame Fields}}

\paragraph{Field: Frame Width}\label{field-frame-width}

The width of the frame elements when projected onto the plane of the window. It is assumed that the top, bottom and side elements of the frame have the same width. If not, an average frame width should be entered such that the projected frame area calculated using the average value equals the sum of the areas of the frame elements.

\paragraph{Field: Frame Outside Projection}\label{field-frame-outside-projection}

The amount by which the frame projects outward from the outside surface of the window glazing. If the outer surface of the frame is flush with the glazing, Frame Outside Projection = 0.0. Used to calculate shadowing of frame onto glass, solar absorbed by frame, IR emitted and absorbed by frame, and convection from frame.

\paragraph{Field: Frame Inside Projection}\label{field-frame-inside-projection}

The amount by which the frame projects inward from the inside surface of the window glazing. If the inner surface of the frame is flush with the glazing, Frame Inside Projection = 0.0. Used to calculate solar absorbed by frame, IR emitted and absorbed by frame, and convection from frame.

\caption{Illustration showing frame and divider dimensioning. \protect \label{fig:illustration-showing-frame-and-divider}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Field: Frame Conductance}\label{field-frame-conductance}

The effective thermal conductance of the frame measured from inside to outside frame surface (no air films) and taking 2-D conduction effects into account. Obtained from the WINDOW program or other 2-D calculation.

\paragraph{Field: Ratio of Frame-Edge Glass Conductance to Center-Of-Glass Conductance}\label{field-ratio-of-frame-edge-glass-conductance-to-center-of-glass-conductance}

The glass conductance near the frame (excluding air films) divided by the glass conductance at the center of the glazing (excluding air films). Used only for multi-pane glazing constructions. This ratio is greater than 1.0 because of thermal bridging from the glazing across the frame and across the spacer that separates the glass panes. Values can be obtained from the WINDOW program the user-selected glazing construction and frame characteristics.

\paragraph{Field: Frame Solar Absorptance}\label{field-frame-solar-absorptance}

The solar absorptance of the frame. The value is assumed to be the same on the inside and outside of the frame and to be independent of angle of incidence of solar radiation. If solar reflectance (or reflectivity) data is available, then absorptance is equal to 1.0 minus reflectance (for opaque materials).

\paragraph{Field: Frame Visible Absorptance}\label{field-frame-visible-absorptance}

The visible absorptance of the frame. The value is assumed to be the same on the inside and outside of the frame and to be independent of angle of incidence of solar radiation. If visible reflectance (or reflectivity) data is available, then absorptance is equal to 1.0 minus reflectance (for opaque materials).

\paragraph{Field: Frame Thermal Hemispherical Emissivity}\label{field-frame-thermal-hemispherical-emissivity}

The thermal emissivity of the frame, assumed the same on the inside and outside.

\textbf{\emph{Divider Fields}}

\paragraph{Field: Divider Type}\label{field-divider-type}

The type of divider (see figure below). Divider Type = Suspended is applicable only to multi-pane glazing. It means that the divider is suspended between the panes. (If there are more than two glass layers, the divider is assumed to be placed between the two outermost layers.)

Divider Type = DividedLite means that the divider elements project out from the outside and inside surfaces of the glazing and divide the glazing into individual lites. For multi-pane glazing, this type of divider also has between-glass elements that separate the panes.

\caption{Illustration showing divider types. \protect \label{fig:illustration-showing-divider-types.}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Field: Divider Width}\label{field-divider-width}

The width of the divider elements when projected onto the plane of the window. It is assumed that the horizontal and vertical divider elements have the same width. If not, an average divider width should be entered such that the projected divider area calculated using the average value equals the sum of the areas of the divider elements.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Horizontal Dividers}\label{field-number-of-horizontal-dividers}

The number of divider elements parallel to the top and bottom of the window.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Vertical Dividers}\label{field-number-of-vertical-dividers}

The number of divider elements parallel to the sides of the window.

\paragraph{Field: Divider Outside Projection}\label{field-divider-outside-projection}

The amount by which the divider projects out from the outside surface of the window glazing. For Divider Type = Suspended, Divider Projection = 0.0. Used to calculate shadowing of divider onto glass, solar absorbed by divider, IR emitted and absorbed by divider, and convection from divider.

\paragraph{Field: Divider Inside Projection}\label{field-divider-inside-projection}

The amount by which the divider projects inward from the inside surface of the window glazing. If the inner surface of the divider is flush with the glazing, Divider Inside Projection = 0.0. Used to calculate solar absorbed by divider, IR emitted and absorbed by divider, and convection from divider.

\paragraph{Field: Divider Conductance}\label{field-divider-conductance}

The effective thermal conductance of the divider measured from inside to outside divider surface (no air films) and taking 2-D conduction effects into account. Obtained from the WINDOW program or other 2-D calculation.

\paragraph{Field: Ratio of Divider-Edge Glass Conductance to Center-Of-Glass Conductance}\label{field-ratio-of-divider-edge-glass-conductance-to-center-of-glass-conductance}

The glass conductance near the divider (excluding air films) divided by the glass conductance at the center of the glazing (excluding air films). Used only for multi-pane glazing constructions. This ratio is greater than 1.0 because of thermal bridging from the glazing across the divider and across the spacer that separates the glass panes. Values can be obtained from the WINDOW program for the user-selected glazing construction and divider characteristics.

\paragraph{Field: Divider Solar Absorptance}\label{field-divider-solar-absorptance}

The solar absorptance of the divider. The value is assumed to be the same on the inside and outside of the divider and to be independent of angle of incidence of solar radiation. If solar reflectance (or reflectivity) data is available, then absorptance is equal to 1.0 minus reflectance (for opaque materials).

\paragraph{Field: Divider Visible Absorptance}\label{field-divider-visible-absorptance}

The visible absorptance of the divider. The value is assumed to be the same on the inside and outside of the divider and to be independent of angle of incidence of solar radiation. If visible reflectance (or reflectivity) data is available, then absorptance is equal to 1.0 minus reflectance (for opaque materials).

\paragraph{Field: Divider Thermal Hemispherical Emissivity}\label{field-divider-thermal-hemispherical-emissivity}

The thermal emissivity of the divider, assumed the same on the inside and outside.

\textbf{\emph{Reveal Surface Fields}}

The following fields specify the properties of the window reveal surfaces (reveals occur when the window is not in the same plane as the base surface). From this information and from the geometry of the window and the sun position, the program calculates beam solar radiation absorbed and reflected by the top, bottom, right and left sides of outside and inside window reveal surfaces. In doing this calculation, the shadowing on a reveal surface by other reveal surfaces is determined using the orientation of the reveal surfaces and the sun position.

It is assumed that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The window is an exterior window.
\item
  The reveal surfaces are perpendicular to the window plane.
\item
  If an exterior shade, screen or blind is in place it shades exterior and interior reveal surfaces so that in this case there is no beam solar on these surfaces.
\item
  If an interior shade or blind is in place it shades the interior reveal surfaces so that in this case there is no beam solar on these surfaces.
\item
  The possible shadowing on inside reveal surfaces by a window divider is ignored.
\item
  The outside reveal surfaces (top, bottom, left, right) have the same solar absorptance and depth. This depth is not input here but is automatically determined by the program---from window and wall vertices--as the distance between the plane of the outside face of the glazing and plane of the outside face of the parent wall.
\item
  The inside reveal surfaces are divided into two categories: (1) the bottom reveal surface, called here the ``inside sill;'' and (2) the other reveal surfaces (left, right and top).
\item
  The left, right and top inside reveal surfaces have the same depth and solar absorptance. The inside sill is allowed to have depth and solar absorptance values that are different from the corresponding values for the other inside reveal surfaces.
\item
  The inside sill depth is required to be greater than or equal to the depth of the other inside reveal surfaces. If the inside sill depth is greater than zero the depth of the other inside reveal surfaces is required to be greater than zero.
\item
  The reflection of beam solar radiation from all reveal surfaces is assumed to be isotropic diffuse; there is no specular component.
\item
  Half of the beam solar reflected from outside reveal surfaces is goes towards the window; the other half goes back to the exterior environment (i.e., reflection of this outward-going component from other outside reveal surfaces is not considered).
\item
  The half that goes towards the window is added to the other solar radiation incident on the window. Correspondingly, half of the beam solar reflected from inside reveal surfaces goes towards the window, with the other half going into the zone. The portion going towards the window that is not reflected is absorbed in the glazing or is transmitted back out into the exterior environment.
\item
  The beam solar that is absorbed by outside reveal surfaces is added to the solar absorbed by the outside surface of the window's parent wall; similarly, the beam solar absorbed by the inside reveal surfaces is added to the solar absorbed by the inside surface of the parent wall.
\end{itemize}

The net effect of beam solar reflected from outside reveal surfaces is to increase the heat gain to the zone, whereas the effect of beam solar reflected from inside reveal surfaces is to decrease the heat gain to the zone since part of this reflected solar is transmitted back out the window.

~If the window has a frame, the absorption of reflected beam solar by the inside and outside surfaces of the frame is considered. The shadowing of the frame onto interior reveal surfaces is also considered.

\paragraph{Field: Outside Reveal Solar Absorptance}\label{field-outside-reveal-solar-absorptance}

The solar absorptance of outside reveal surfaces.

\paragraph{Field: Inside Sill Depth}\label{field-inside-sill-depth}

The depth of the inside sill, measured from the inside surface of the glazing to the edge of the sill (see Figure~\ref{fig:a-vertical-section-through-a-window-with}).

\paragraph{Field: Inside Sill Solar Absorptance}\label{field-inside-sill-solar-absorptance}

The solar absorptance of the inside sill.

\textbf{\emph{Field: Inside Reveal Depth}}

The depth of the inside reveal surfaces other than the sill, measured from the inside surface of the glazing to the edge of the reveal surface (see Figure~\ref{fig:a-vertical-section-through-a-window-with}).

\paragraph{Field: Inside Reveal Solar Absorptance}\label{field-inside-reveal-solar-absorptance}

The solar absorptance of the inside reveal surfaces other than the sill.

\subsection{WindowProperty:AirflowControl}\label{windowpropertyairflowcontrol}

This object is used to specify the control mechanism for windows in which forced air flows in the gap between adjacent layers of glass. Such windows are called ``airflow windows.'' They are also known as ``heat-extract windows'' or ``climate windows.''

A common application is to reduce the zone load by exhausting indoor air through the window. In the cooling season this picks up and expels some of the solar heat absorbed by the window glass (and by the between-glass shade or blind, if present). In the heating season this warms the window, reducing the heat loss from the window. A side benefit is increased thermal comfort. This is because the inside surface of the window will generally be cooler in summer and warmer in winter.

The surface output variable ``Surface Window Gap Convective Heat Transfer Rate'' gives the heat picked up (or lost) by the gap airflow.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-34-001}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-31-001}

Name of the window that this WindowProperty:AirflowControl refers to. It must be a window with two or three glass layers, i.e., double- or triple-glazing. For triple-glazing the airflow is assumed to be between the two inner glass layers.

An error will result if the gas in the airflow gap is other than air. If an airflow window has a between-glass shade or blind, the gas in the gap on either side of the shade or blind must be air.

\paragraph{Field: Airflow Source}\label{field-airflow-source}

The source of the gap airflow. The choices are:

\emph{IndoorAir}: Indoor air from the window's zone is passed through the window.

\emph{OutdoorAir}: Outdoor air is passed through the window.

\paragraph{Field: Airflow Destination}\label{field-airflow-destination}

This is where the gap air goes after passing through the window. The choices are:

\emph{IndoorAir}: The gap air goes to the indoor air of the window's zone.

\emph{OutdoorAir}: The gap air goes to the outside air.

\emph{ReturnAir}. The gap air goes to the return air for the window's zone. This choice is allowed only if Airflow Source = InsideAir. If the return air flow is zero, the gap air goes to the indoor air of the window's zone. If the sum of the gap airflow for all of the windows in a zone with Airflow Destination = ReturnAir exceeds the return airflow, then the difference between this sum and the return airflow goes to the indoor air. The name of the Return Air Node may be specified below.

Figure~\ref{fig:gap-airflow-configurations-for-airflow} shows the allowed combinations of Airflow Source and Airflow Destination. The allowed combinations of Airflow Source and Airflow Destination are:

IndoorAir -\textgreater{} OutdoorAir

IndoorAir -\textgreater{} IndoorAir

IndoorAir -\textgreater{} ReturnAir

OutdoorAir -\textgreater{} IndoorAir

OutdoorAir -\textgreater{} OutdoorAir

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-flow-rate-003}

The maximum value of the airflow, in m\(^{3}\)/s per m of glazing width. The value is typically 0.006 to 0.009 m\(^{3}\)/s-m (4 to 6 cfm/ft).

The airflow can be modulated by specifying Airflow Has Multiplier Schedule = Yes and giving the name of the Airflow Multiplier Schedule (see below).

The fan energy used to move the air through the gap is generally very small and so is ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Airflow Control Type}\label{field-airflow-control-type}

Specifies how the airflow is controlled. The choices are:

\emph{AlwaysOnAtMaximumFlow}. The airflow is always equal to Maximum Airflow.

\emph{AlwaysOff}. The airflow is always zero.

\emph{ScheduledOnly}. The airflow in a particular timestep equals Maximum Airflow times the value of the Airflow Multiplier Schedule for that timestep.

\paragraph{Field: Airflow Is Scheduled}\label{field-airflow-is-scheduled}

Specifies if the airflow is scheduled. The choices are:

\emph{Yes}. The airflow is scheduled.

\emph{No}. The airflow is not scheduled.

If Yes, Airflow Multiplier Schedule Name is required.

\paragraph{Field: Airflow Multiplier Schedule Name}\label{field-airflow-multiplier-schedule-name}

The name of a schedule with values between 0.0 and 1.0. The timestep value of the airflow is Maximum Airflow times the schedule value. Required if Airflow Is Scheduled = Yes. Unused if Airflow Is Scheduled = No. This schedule should have a ScheduleType with Numeric Type = Continuous and Range = 0.0 : 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Airflow Return Air Node Name}\label{field-airflow-return-air-node-name}

The name of the return air node for this airflow window if the Airflow Destination is ReturnAir. If left blank, this defaults to the first return air node for the zone containing the window surface.

\subsection{WindowProperty:StormWindow}\label{windowpropertystormwindow}

This object allows you to assign a movable exterior glass layer (``storm window'' or ``storm glass'') that is usually applied to a window in the winter to reduce heat loss and removed in the summer. A WindowProperty:StormWindow object is required for each window that has an associated storm window. It is assumed that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When the storm glass is in place it is the outermost layer of the window, it covers only the glazed part of the window and not the frame, and it forms a tight seal. See Figure~\ref{fig:section-through-a-single-glazed-window}.
\item
  When the storm glass is not in place it is completely removed and has no effect on window heat transfer.
\item
  The gap between the storm glass and rest of the glazing is filled with air.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 40
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image066.png}
\caption{Section through a single-glazed window without (left) and with (right) a storm glass layer. Not to scale. \protect \label{fig:section-through-a-single-glazed-window}}
\end{figure}

With the addition of a storm window, single glazing effectively becomes double glazing, double glazing becomes triple glazing, etc.

The presence of a storm window is indicated by the output variable ``Surface Storm Window On Off Status'' (see ``Window Output Variables''). This flag is \textbf{0} if the storm window is off, \textbf{1} if it is on, and \textbf{--1} if the window does not have an associated storm window.

The program automatically creates a window construction (ref: Construction) that consists of the storm window glass layer and its adjacent air layer added to the original (unshaded, or ``bare'') window construction. In the eplusout.eio file this construction is called BARECONSTRUCTIONWITHSTORMWIN:\emph{n}, where \emph{n} is the number of the associated StormWin object. If the window has a shaded construction, the program creates a construction called SHADEDCONSTRUCTIONWITHSTORMWIN:\emph{n} that consists of the storm window glass layer and its adjacent air layer added to the original shaded window construction.

The program also creates a \hyperref[windowmaterialgas]{WindowMaterial:Gas} layer corresponding to the air layer adjacent to the storm glass. In the eplusout.eio file this layer is called AIR:STORMWIN:\emph{k}MM, where \emph{k} is the thickness of the air layer expressed as an integer number of millimeters.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-35-001}

\paragraph{Field: Window Name}\label{field-window-name-000}

This is the name of a window (or glass door) to which the storm glass is applied. Not all windows can accept WindowProperty:StormWindow. The rules are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The window must be an exterior window. WindowProperty:StormWindow is not applicable to interior (interzone) windows.
\item
  The window construction (without the storm glass layer) can have up to three glass layers.
\item
  If the window has an associated shaded construction (ref: \hyperref[windowpropertyshadingcontrol]{WindowShadingControl}), that construction can have an interior shade or blind and up to three glass layers, or a between-glass shade or blind and two glass layers. The shaded construction cannot have an exterior shade or blind, cannot have a between-glass shade or blind and three glass layers, and cannot be switchable glazing.
\item
  The window cannot be an airflow window, i.e., a window that has an associated \hyperref[windowpropertyairflowcontrol]{WindowProperty:AirflowControl}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Storm Glass Layer Name}\label{field-storm-glass-layer-name}

This is the name of a window glass material. Storm windows are assumed to consist of a single layer of glass. A storm window frame, if present, is ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Distance Between Storm Glass Layer and Adjacent Glass}\label{field-distance-between-storm-glass-layer-and-adjacent-glass}

The separation between the storm glass and the rest of the window (Figure~\ref{fig:section-through-a-single-glazed-window}). It is measured from the inside of the storm glass layer to the outside of the adjacent glass layer.

\paragraph{Field: Month that Storm Glass Layer Is Put On}\label{field-month-that-storm-glass-layer-is-put-on}

The number of the month (January = 1, February = 2, etc.) during which the storm window is put in place.

\paragraph{Field: Day of Month that Storm Glass Layer Is Put On}\label{field-day-of-month-that-storm-glass-layer-is-put-on}

The day of the month that the storm window is put in place. It is assumed that the storm window is put in place at the beginning of this day, i.e., during the first simulation timestep of the day, and remains in place until that month and day given by the following two fields.

\paragraph{Field: Month that Storm Glass Layer Is Taken Off}\label{field-month-that-storm-glass-layer-is-taken-off}

The number of the month (January = 1, February = 2, etc.) during which the storm window is removed.

\paragraph{Field: Day of Month that Storm Glass Layer Is Taken Off}\label{field-day-of-month-that-storm-glass-layer-is-taken-off}

The day of the month that the storm window is removed. It is assumed that the storm window is removed at the beginning of this day, i.e., during the first simulation timestep of the day, and stays off until the month and day given by Month that Storm Glass Layer Is Put On, Day of Month that Storm Glass Layer Is Put On.

In the northern hemisphere, the month the storm window is put on is generally greater than the month it is taken off (for example put on in month 10, when it starts to get cold, and taken off in month 5, when it starts to warm up). In the southern hemisphere this is reversed: month on is less than month off.

An IDF example of WindowProperty:StormWindow. The storm window is put in place on October 15 and removed on May 1.

\subsection{Importing Windows from WINDOW program}\label{importing-windows-from-window-program}

\begin{callout}
WINDOW v6.3 and later is capable of writing IDF excerpts for Window data. This is the preferred method as no external file is necessary. See the Tips document for details on obtaining the IDF excerpt.
\end{callout}

The WINDOW program calculates the U-value, Solar Heat Gain Coefficient, solar transmission/absorption characteristics, visible transmission characteristics and other properties of a window under standard indoor and outdoor conditions. WINDOW treats the whole window system---glazing, frame and divider. A sub-program of WINDOW called THERM uses a 2-D finite element calculation to determine the effective conductance of frame, divider and edge-of-glass elements. Another sub-program, OPTICS, determines the solar-optical properties of glazing, including laminates and coated glass.

WINDOW can write a data file containing a description of the window that was analyzed. An example of this file (which is no longer the preferred method) is shown in the Tips document under WINDOW generated files. is shown below. This file, which can be named by the user, can be read by EnergyPlus. For more complete description and examples, see the object description -- \hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile}.

In this way, the same window that was created in WINDOW can be imported into EnergyPlus for annual energy analysis without having to re-input the window data. To obtain WINDOW, THERM, or OPTICS go to \url{http://windows.lbl.gov} and choose the software link. A major advantage of using WINDOW to create window input for EnergyPlus is that you will have direct access to WINDOW's expanding database of over 1000 different glass types; and you will be able to browse through this database according to different criteria (color, transmittance, solar heat gain coefficient, etc.) to help you select the best glass type for your application.

Although WINDOW writes only one window entry on the WINDOW data file, EnergyPlus users can combine two or more of these files to end up with a single data file with multiple window entries of different types. In this way a library of windows from WINDOW can be built up if so desired. If you combine files like this you should be sure not to leave out or change any of lines from the original files.

There are four methods for inputting window constructions in EnergyPlus:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  input full spectral data for each layer in the IDF,
\item
  input spectral average data for each layer in the IDF,
\item
  items 1 and 2 can be accomplished by reporting the IDF excerpt method from WINDOW
\item
  import WINDOW report containing layer-by-layer calculated values and overall glazing system angular values.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{callout}
  \warning{Note: When using method 4, the overall glazing system angular dependent properties, including Tsol, Abs, Rfsol, Rbsol, Tvis, Rfvis, and Rbvis, are not used by EnergyPlus. Therefore, methods 1 and 2 and preferably 3 are recommended.}
\end{callout}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The SHGC calculations in EnergyPlus for window layers input using full spectral data use a spectral weighting data set (derived from Optics5 data file ISO-9845GlobalNorm.std) that is different from the WINDOW default spectral weighting data set (W5\_NFRC\_2003.std). This difference accounts for most of the variation in SHGC values reported by EnergyPlus and WINDOW for full spectral data window layer input. This variation is more pronounced for window constructions of three glass layers or more.
\item
  Users intending to select a window construction based on SHGC value for energy code compliance should base their selection on the value reported by WINDOW since this is the officially recognized value.
\end{itemize}

In EnergyPlus, the Window data file is searched for each ``\hyperref[constructionwindowdatafile]{Construction:WindowDataFile}'' object in the EnergyPlus input. This object has a very simple form:

\begin{lstlisting}
Construction:WindowDataFile,
  ConstructionName,
  FileName; ! Default is Window5DataFile.dat in the "run" folder.
\end{lstlisting}

If there is a window called ConstructionName on the Window data file, the data for that window is read from the file and the following EnergyPlus objects and their names are created. The ``W5'' prefixed to these names indicates that the object originated in the Window data file.

\subsection{Using LBNLs Windows Calculation Engine}\label{windowscalculationengine}
This is new windows simulation engine that will be used in both EnergyPlus and Berkeley Lab WINDOW. The intent is for this engine to replace all other window calculation modules in EnergyPlus. For the time being, other modules will still be available. To use the new Window Calculation Engine, insert the following into IDF:

 \begin{lstlisting}
 WindowsCalculationEngine,
 ExternalWindowsModel;
 \end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Zone Thermal Output(s)}\label{zone-thermal-outputs-1}

In addition to the canned Surface reports (view the Reports section later in this document) and surface variables (above), the following variables are available for all zones:

\begin{lstlisting}
Zone,Sum,Zone Total Internal Radiant Heating Energy [J]
Zone,Sum,Zone Total Internal Visible Radiation Heating Energy [J]
Zone,Sum,Zone Total Internal Convective Heating Energy [J]
Zone,Sum,Zone Total Internal Latent Gain Energy [J]
Zone,Sum,Zone Total Internal Total Heating Energy [J]
Zone,Average,Zone Mean Air Temperature [C]
HVAC,Average,Zone Air Temperature [C]
Zone,Average,Zone Mean Radiant Temperature [C]
Zone,Average,Zone Operative Temperature [C]
Zone,Average,Zone Heat Index [C]
Zone,Average,Zone Humidity Index [C]
HVAC,Sum,Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy [J]
HVAC,Sum,Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Energy [J]
HVAC,Average,Zone Air System Sensible Heating Rate [W]
HVAC,Average,Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Rate [W]
HVAC,Average,Zone Air Humidity Ratio[kgWater/kgDryAir]
HVAC,Average,Zone Air Relative Humidity[%]
\end{lstlisting}

Two of these are of particular interest:

\begin{lstlisting}
Zone,Average,Zone Mean Air Temperature [C]
HVAC,Average,Zone Air Temperature [C]
\end{lstlisting}

These two variable outputs are/should be identical. However, note that they can be reported at different time intervals. ``Zone Mean Air Temperature'' is only available on the Zone/HB timestep (Number of Timesteps per Hour) whereas ``Zone Air Temperature'' can be reported at the HVAC timestep (which can vary).

\subsubsection{Zone Mean Air Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-mean-air-temperature-c-1}

From the code definition, the zone mean air temperature is the average temperature of the air temperatures at the system timestep. Remember that the zone heat balance represents a ``well stirred'' model for a zone, therefore there is only one mean air temperature to represent the air temperature for the zone.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-air-temperature-c-1}

This is very similar to the mean air temperature in the last field. The ``well stirred'' model for the zone is the basis, but this temperature is also available at the ``detailed'' system timestep.

\subsubsection{Zone Mean Radiant Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-mean-radiant-temperature-c-1}

The Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) in degrees Celsius of a space is really the measure of the combined effects of temperatures of surfaces within that space. The larger the surface area and the closer one is to it, the more effect the surface temperature of that surface has on each other. The MRT is the measure of all these surface areas and temperatures.

\subsubsection{Zone Operative Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{zone-operative-temperature-c-1}

Zone Operative Temperature (OT) is the average of the Zone Mean Air Temperature (MAT) and Zone Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), OT = 0.5*MAT + 0.5*MRT. This output variable is not affected by the type of thermostat controls in the zone, and does not include the direct effect of high temperature radiant systems.~ See also Zone Thermostat Operative Temperature.

\subsubsection{Zone Heat Index {[}C{]}}\label{zone-heat-index-c-1}

Zone heat index (HI) is an index that combines air temperature and relative humidity in shaded areas, to posit a human-perceived equivalent temperature, as how hot it would feel if the humidity were some other value in the shade. The HI measures the temperature feels like to the human body when relative humidity is combined with the air temperature. Zone Heat Index is only reported when ThermalResilienceSummary is declared in Output:Table:SummaryReports.  


\subsubsection{Zone Humdity Index {[}C{]}}\label{zone-humidity-index-c-1}

The Humdity Index (humidex) is an index number used by Canadian meteorologists to describe how hot the weather feels to the average person, by combining the effect of heat and humidity. The humidex is a nominally dimensionless quantity (though generally recognized by the public as equivalent to the degree Celsius) based on the dew-point temperature. Zone Humdity Index is only reported when ThermalResilienceSummary is declared in Output:Table:SummaryReports.  

\subsubsection{Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-air-system-sensible-heating-energy-j-1}

This field represents the sensible heating energy in Joules that is actually supplied by the system to that zone for the timestep reported. This is the sensible heating rate multiplied by the simulation timestep. This is calculated and reported from the Correct step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\begin{callout}
Zone Air System Sensible Heating (and Cooling) Energy (and Rate) all report the heating or cooling delivered by the HVAC system to a zone. These values are calculated by multiplying the supply air mass flow rate by the difference between the supply air temperature and the zone air temperature. This does not always indicate the operation of heating or cooling coils. For example, cooling will be reported if the supply air is cooled due to the introduction of outside air, even if all coils are off.

Note that these variables are calculated at the system timestep. When reported at the ``detailed'' reporting frequency, these variable will never show heating and cooling both in the same system timestep. If reported at a frequency less than ``Detailed'' (for example, Hourly) values may appear in both the heating and cooling variable for the same hour if the system cooled the zone for part of the reporting period and heated the zone for another part of the reporting period.
\end{callout}

\subsubsection{Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-air-system-sensible-cooling-energy-j-1}

This field represents the sensible cooling energy in Joules that is actually supplied by the system to that zone for the timestep reported. This is the sensible cooling rate multiplied by the simulation timestep. This is calculated and reported from the Correct step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.

\subsubsection{Zone Air System Sensible Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-system-sensible-heating-rate-w-1}

This field represents the sensible heating rate in Watts that is actually supplied by the system to that zone for the timestep reported. This is calculated and reported from the Correct step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers. The Zone Air System Sensible Heating Rate may not agree exactly with the equipment-level delivered energy transfer rate when the zone temperature is changing significantly over a timestep (e.g. during thermostat setback and setup), but the energy will balance out over time.

\subsubsection{Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Rate {[}W{]}}\label{zone-air-system-sensible-cooling-rate-w-1}

This field represents the sensible cooling rate in Watts that is actually supplied by the system to that zone for the timestep reported. This is calculated and reported from the Correct step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This field is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers. The Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Rate may not agree exactly with the equipment-level delivered energy transfer rate when the zone temperature is changing significantly over a timestep (e.g. during thermostat setback and setup), but the energy will balance out over time.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Humidity Ratio{[}kgWater/kgDryAir{]}}\label{zone-air-humidity-ratiokgwaterkgdryair}

This field represents the air humidity ratio after the correct step for each zone. The humidity ratio is the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air contained in the zone in (kg water/kg air) and is unitless.

\subsubsection{Zone Air Relative Humidity{[}\%{]}}\label{zone-air-relative-humidity-1}

This field represents the air relative humidity ratio after the correct step for each zone. The relative humidity is in percent and uses the Zone Air Temperature, the Zone Air Humidity Ratio and the Outside Barometric Pressure for calculation.

\subsubsection{Zone Total Internal Radiant Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-radiant-heating-energy-j-1}

This field represents the sum of radiant gains from specific internal sources (e.g.~equipment) throughout the zone in joules. This includes radiant gain from \hyperref[people]{People}, Lights, Electric Equipment, Gas Equipment, Other Equipment, Hot Water Equipment, and Steam Equipment.

\subsubsection{Zone-Total Internal Visible Heat Gain {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-visible-heat-gain-j}

This field expresses the sum of heat gain in joules that is the calculated short wavelength radiation gain from lights in the zones. This calculation uses the total energy from lights and the fraction visible to realize this value, summed over the zones in the simulation.

\subsubsection{Zone Total Internal Convective Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-convective-heating-energy-j-1}

This field represents the sum of convective gains from specific sources (e.g.~equipment) throughout the zone in joules. This includes convective gain from \hyperref[people]{People}, Lights, Electric Equipment, Gas Equipment, Other Equipment, Hot Water Equipment, and Steam Equipment.

\subsubsection{Zone Total Internal Latent Gain Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-latent-gain-energy-j-1}

This field represents the sum of latent gains from specific internal sources (e.g.~equipment) throughout the zone in joules. This includes latent gain from \hyperref[people]{People}, Electric Equipment, Gas Equipment, Other Equipment, Hot Water Equipment, and Steam Equipment.

\subsubsection{Zone Total Internal Total Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{zone-total-internal-total-heating-energy-j-1}

This field represents the sum of all heat gains throughout the zone in joules. This includes all heat gains from \hyperref[people]{People}, Lights, Electric Equipment, Gas Equipment, Other Equipment, Hot Water Equipment, and Steam Equipment.
