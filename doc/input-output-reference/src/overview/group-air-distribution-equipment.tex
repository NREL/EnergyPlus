\section{Group -- Zone HVAC Air Loop Terminal Units}\label{group-zone-HVAC-air-loop-terminal-units}

The systems described in the Air Distribution Units (ADU's) are shown below. A variety of air terminal units are available for connecting air systems to thermal zones. These single description ADU's contain the reference to the components and the actual controls in one block of input. The idea is that the control volume is drawn tightly around the controls and loosely around the components. This allows complex interactions to take place between all of the components that respond to the Zone Thermostatic Control output. The coils that are referenced in the ADU's are explained fully in the ``Coils'' section of this manual.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat}\label{airterminalsingleductconstantvolumereheat}

The AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat or terminal reheat system is a constant volume reheat system. The systems cooling capabilities are provided by way of cooling coil that supplies cooling to the entire supply air volume. The cooling coil is controlled by a controller setpoint specified for the cooling coil. Zone control is accomplished by heating (reheating) the airflow into each zone as determined by the zone thermostat. Currently the reheat can be supplied by a electric, gas, or hot water coil that tries to meet the zone demand.

\subsubsection{Inputs}

\paragraph{Field: Name}

Unique name for the terminal reheat Air Distribution Unit (ADU).

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}

Schedule that this component will operate or is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}

The outlet node from the ADU to the zone. This is the same node as the reheat component air outlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}

The air-inlet node name that connects the air splitter to the individual zone ADU. This is the same node as the reheat component air inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate}

The design constant volume flow rate (m\(^{3}\)/sec) specified for the terminal reheat ADU.

\paragraph{Field: Reheat Coil Object Type}\label{field-reheat-coil-object-type}

The valid reheat component objects currently available are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingwater]{Coil:Heating:Water}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingelectric]{Coil:Heating:Electric}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatinggas-000]{Coil:Heating:Fuel}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingsteam]{Coil:Heating:Steam}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Reheat Coil Name}\label{field-reheat-coil-name}

Reheat Coil Object name being simulated with this ADU. Applicable for all coils.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-hot-water-or-steam-flow-rate}

This field is zero for gas and electric coils. Set to the maximum design hot water or steam volumetric flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s for the hot water or steam heating coil. The steam volumetric~ flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate}\label{field-minimum-hot-water-or-steam-flow-rate}

This field is zero for gas and electric coils. Set to the minimum design hot water or steam volumetric flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s for the hot water or steam coil, normally set to be a shut off valve that is set to zero. The steam volumetric~ flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa.

\paragraph{Field: Convergence Tolerance}\label{field-convergence-tolerance}

The coil is controlled by knowing the zone demand determined by the zone thermostat and setting the outlet conditions to meet this demand. For the electric and gas coils, this is set exactly since the coil model solution can be inverted. With the hot water coil that uses an effectiveness-NTU method, the solution cannot be inverted directly. Therefore, to determine the correct mass flow rate for the hot water the solution is solved for by iteration. The iterative solution uses an interval halving routine and needs a termination criterion that is set with the Convergence Tolerance parameter. This control offset is set to a decimal fraction of the zone demand as the criteria, i.e.~0.001. The default for the field is 0.001.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Reheat Air Temperature}\label{field-maximum-reheat-air-temperature}

This is the upper limit on the temperature in degrees C of the air leaving the terminal unit -- reheat coil (and being delivered to the zone). If the user leaves this field blank, no maximum reheat air temperature is enforced.

\subsubsection{Outputs}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}}\label{zone-air-terminal-outdoor-air-volume-flow-rate-m3s}

This output is the amount of outdoor air entering the zone. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The amount of outdoor air is defined as the terminal unit air volume flow rate multiplied by the fraction of outdoor air entering the air loop's outside air system.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat}\label{airterminalsingleductconstantvolumenoreheat}
The AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat object creates the capability of supplying central system air directly to a zone without any zone level thermostat control. The supply air temperature is controlled by the central system controller. It is typically used with a unitary system and furnaces which controls the system supply temperature and flow rate with continuous or cycling fan. When used without the Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name, the terminal unit is passive and accepts any flow rate supplied by the central system, but will never exceed the maximum air flow rate.

This object allows the program to know what zone this branch of the air system is attached to, and input fields for availability schedule, air inlet and outlet nodes, the maximum air flow rate, and other two optional input fields. The air inlet node should be the same as one of the \emph{\hyperref[airloophvaczonesplitter]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter}} or \emph{\hyperref[airloophvacsupplyplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum}} component  outlet nodes. The air outlet node name should be same as zone air inlet node name and the air distribution unit air outlet node name. The last two optional input fields: \textit{Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name}, and \textit{Per Person Ventilation Rate Mode} are used for modulating the outdoor air requirement of an air terminal unit depending on the method.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-001}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-000}

A unique user assigned name for the single duct constant volume no reheat air terminal unit.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-1}

Availability schedule name for this system. Schedule value > 0 means the system is available or else the system is off. If this field is blank, the system is always available.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name}

The air inlet node name that connects the air splitter to the individual zone air distribution unit. This node should also be one of the outlet air node of an \hyperref[airloophvaczonesplitter]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter} or \hyperref[airloophvacsupplyplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum} component.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-air-outlet-node-name}

This is an air outlet node from the air distribution unit. This node name should be one of the supply air inlet node names of the zone served by this component.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-air-flow-rate-1}

The design maximum volume flow rate~ (m\(^{3}\)/sec). This field is autosizable.

\paragraph{Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name}

This field is used to modulate the terminal unit flow rate based on the specified outdoor air requirement. When the name of a \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorair]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} or \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorairspacelist]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir:SpaceList} object is entered, the terminal unit will adjust flow to meet this outdoor air requirement and no more. Load is still "Uncontrolled." If Outdoor Air Flow per Person is non-zero, then the outdoor air requirement will be computed based on either the current or design occupancy as specified in the \textit{Per Person Ventilation Rate Mode} input field below. At no time will the supply air flow rate exceed the value for Maximum Air Flow Rate. The requested flow rate may not be fully met if the system is operating with cycling fan. The volume flow rate is converted to mass flow rate using the standard density of air at Pressure = 101325 Pa, Temperature = 20C, and Humidity Ratio = 0.0. If this field is blank, then the terminal unit will not be controlled for outdoor air flow. This field is optional.

\paragraph{Field: Per Person Ventilation Rate Mode}\label{field-per-person-ventilation-rate-mode}

This field specifies the occupancy level to use when calculating the ventilation rate per person when a Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name has been specified. \textit{CurrentOccupancy} uses the current number of people in the zone which may vary. \textit{DesignOccupancy} uses the total Number of People specified for the zone which is constant.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}}

This output is the amount of outdoor air entering the zone. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The amount of outdoor air is defined as the terminal unit air volume flow rate multiplied by the fraction of outdoor air entering the air loop's outside air system.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat}\label{airterminalsingleductvavreheat}

AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat - Variable air volume (VAV) systems control the dry-bulb temperature inside a zone by varying the supply air volume instead of the air temperature. At full cooling the VAV damper is fully open supplying the specified maximum air flow rate. As the cooling load decreases, the damper closes until it reaches the minimum stop specified by the zone minimum air flow fraction. The zone minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field \textit{Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.

VAV systems can be used for interior or perimeter zones with a common fan system, air temperature control, and reheating devices. The VAV concept may vary according to the VAV box locations, air temperature controls and types of heating elements. Heating can usually be provided by use of reheat coils or thermostatic baseboard.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-001}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-2-000}

Unique name for the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat Air Distribution Unit (ADU).

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-2}

Schedule that this component will operate or is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Damper Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-damper-air-outlet-node-name}

The VAV damper outlet node. This is the outlet node of the damper and the inlet node of the reheat coil.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name-1}

The air inlet node name that connects the air splitter to the individual zone ADU. This is \emph{not} the same as the air inlet node of the reheat component: it is upstream of that node. This is the inlet node to the terminal unit and the damper

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-air-flow-rate-2}

The design maximum volume flow rate (m\(^{3}\)/sec) specified for VAV ADU.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Minimum Air Flow Method}\label{field-zone-minimum-air-flow-method}

This field is used to select how the program will determine the minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating.~ The minimum flow rate is modeled as a fraction of the maximum flow rate.~ There are three choices for selecting how the minimum flow rate is specified:~ Constant, FixedFlowRate, and Scheduled.~ If Constant is entered, then the program will use the value for the constant minimum air flow fraction entered in the following field.~ If FixedFlowRate is entered, then the program will use the value for minimum flow rate entered in the field below called Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate.~ If Scheduled is entered, then the program will obtain the value for minimum flow fraction from the schedule named in the field below called Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name.~ The default is Constant.

\paragraph{Field: Constant Minimum Air Flow Fraction}\label{field-constant-minimum-air-flow-fraction}

The minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate. The minimum zone fraction is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. The reheat coil operates only when the damper is at this minimum flow rate when Damper Heating Action is set to Normal.~ This field is used if the previous field is set to Constant.~ If the previous field is set to Scheduled (and the field Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate is set to autosize), then this field is optional and can be used to separately control the air flow rate used for sizing normal-action reheat coils. If this field and the following field have values, the greater of the two is used for sizing.

This field is autosizable and defaulted to autosize. The autosized flow fraction is calculated using the maximum flow rate derived from the design outdoor air flow (including VRP adjustments) and the \hyperref[sizingzone]{Sizing:Zone} input fields ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow per Zone Floor Area'', ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow'', and ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow Fraction''. If there is no sizing calculation the defaults of 0.000762 cubic meters per second per square meter of zone floor area (0.15 cfm/ft2) and 0.2 are used. The autosized flow fraction is calculated according to the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 Simplified Procedure if the Sizing:System's ``System Outdoor Air Method'' associated with this terminal is set to Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure, see the \hyperref[field-system-outdoor-air-method]{System Outdoor Air Method} of the Sizing:System object.

\paragraph{Field: Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate}\label{field-fixed-minimum-air-flow-rate}

The minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fixed minimum air flow rate in meters cubed per second. The minimum air flow rate is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. The reheat coil operates only when the damper is at this minimum flow rate when Damper Heating Action is set to Normal (the default).~ This field is used if the Zone Minimum Air Flow Method field is set to FixedFlowRate. If the Zone Minimum Air Flow Method field is set to Scheduled (and the field Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate is set to autosize), then this field is optional and can be used to separately control the air flow rate used for sizing normal-action reheat coils. Only one of these two minimum air flow fields (i.e., this field and the previous field) should be used at any time. If this field and the previous field have values, the greater of the two is used for sizing.

This field is autosizable and defaulted to autosize. The autosized flow rate is the maximum flow rate derived from the design outdoor air flow (including VRP adjustments) and the \hyperref[sizingzone]{Sizing:Zone} input fields ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow per Zone Floor Area'', ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow'', and ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow Fraction''. If there is no sizing calculation the defaults of 0.000762 cubic meters per second per square meter of zone floor area (0.15 cfm/ft2) and 0.2 flow fraction are used. The autosized flow rate is calculated according to the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 Simplified Procedure if the Sizing:System's ``System Outdoor Air Method'' associated with this terminal is set to Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure, see the \hyperref[field-system-outdoor-air-method]{System Outdoor Air Method} of the Sizing:System object.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name}\label{field-minimum-air-flow-fraction-schedule-name}

The name of a schedule that determines the value of the minimum air flow fraction.~ The schedule should contain fractions from 0.0 to 1.0.~ These values will define the minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate.~ The reheat coil operates only when the damper is at this minimum flow rate when Damper Heating Action is set to Normal (the default).~ This field is used if the previous field is set to Scheduled.~ If the previous field is left blank (and the field Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate is set to autosize), then the air flow rate used for sizing normal-action reheat coils is the average of the minimum and maximum values in this schedule.~ The air flow rate used for reheat coil sizing is reported with other component sizing information as ``Reheat Coil Sizing Air Volume Flow Rate.''

\paragraph{Field: Reheat Coil Object Type}\label{field-reheat-coil-object-type-1}

The valid reheat component objects currently available are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingwater]{Coil:Heating:Water}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingelectric]{Coil:Heating:Electric}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatinggas-000]{Coil:Heating:Fuel}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingsteam]{Coil:Heating:Steam}
\end{itemize}

If there is no reheat coil, use \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavnoreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat} instead of this object.

\paragraph{Field: Reheat Coil Name}\label{field-reheat-coil-name-1}

Reheat Coil Object name being simulated with this ADU. Applicable for all coils. If there is no reheat coil, use object \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavnoreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat} instead of this object.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-hot-water-or-steam-flow-rate-1}

This field is zero for gas and electric coils. Set to the maximum design hot water or steam volumetric flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s for the hot water or steam heating coil. The steam volumetric flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. This field is autosizable. If there is no reheat coil, this is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate}\label{field-minimum-hot-water-or-steam-flow-rate-1}

This field is zero for gas and electric coils. Set to the minimum design hot water or steam volumetric flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s for the hot water or steam heating coil, normally set to be a shut off valve that is set to zero. The steam volumetric flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. If there is no reheat coil, this is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-air-outlet-node-name-1}

The terminal unit outlet node. This is the outlet node of the reheat coil and the zone inlet node.

\paragraph{Field: Convergence Tolerance}\label{field-convergence-tolerance-1}

The coil is controlled by knowing the zone demand determined by the zone thermostat and setting the outlet conditions to meet this demand. For the electric and gas coils, this is set exactly since the coil model solution can be inverted. With the hot water coil that uses an effectiveness-NTU method, the solution cannot be inverted directly. Therefore, to determine the correct mass flow rate for the hot water the solution is solved for by iteration. The iterative solution uses an interval halving routine and needs a termination criteria that is set with the Convergence Tolerance parameter. This control offset is set to a decimal fraction of the zone demand as the criteria, i.e.~0.001. The default for the field is 0.001.

\paragraph{Field: Damper Heating Action}\label{field-damper-heating-action}

During heating operation, there are three control options for the damper controlling the air flow in the VAV terminal unit as the zone moves above or below the zone setpoint. With all three control options, the damper is at the minimum air flow rate whenever the zone temperature is between the cooling and heating setpoints (deadband condition).

With \textbf{Normal} action, the damper will remain at the minimum air flow rate during heating operation. As the heating load increases, the water flow rate in the reheat coil will be increased to maintain temperature in the zone until the maximum water flow rate is reached or the user-specified maximum reheat air temperature is reached. This is sometimes called the single maximum control logic as illustrated below.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 102
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image264.png}
\caption{The Single Maximum Control Logic \protect \label{fig:the-single-maximum-control-logic}}
\end{figure}

With \textbf{Reverse} and \textbf{ReverseWithLimits} (the default) action, as the heating load increases, the unit starts at minimum air flow and minimum hot water flow. The hot water flow is increased until it reaches maximum flow or the user-specified maximum reheat air temperature is reached, then the air damper starts to open to meet the load. For \textbf{Reverse} the damper can open all the way. For \textbf{ReverseWithLimits}s the damper can only partially open to a maximum flow rate given by the following two fields. These options are used if the minimum air flow rate is not adequate to serve the peak heating load. This is sometimes called the dual maximum control logic as illustrated in following figure. For heating coil types other than the hot-water coil, e.g.~electric, steam, and gas, the reverse action works the same as the normal action -- always keeping the air flow at the minimum during heating.

The dual-max control currently applies to the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat objects with reverse acting dampers and hot-water coils.

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 103

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio=true]{media/image265.png}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Control Fields for Maximum Flow During Reheat:}\label{control-fields-for-maximum-flow-during-reheat}

The following two fields are used only when Reheat Coil Object Type = \hyperref[coilheatingwater]{Coil:Heating:Water} and Damper Heating Action = ReverseWithLimits. Maximum Flow per Zone Floor Area During Reheat and Maximum Flow Fraction During Reheat are two optional methods to calculate the maximum allowable air flow rate during reheat operation. If both are entered, the greater resulting flow rate is used. If Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name is also specified, it may increase this limit to meet the outdoor air flow rate requirement. At no time will the maximum flow rate calculated here exceed the value for Maximum Air Flow Rate.

This limit is active only when the zone thermostat requests heating and the VAV box damper is reverse acting (i.e., ReverseWithLimits).

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Flow per Zone Floor Area During Reheat}\label{field-maximum-flow-per-zone-floor-area-during-reheat}

This factor (m\(^{3}\)/s-m\(^{2}\)) is multiplied by the zone area, to determine the maximum volume flow rate (m\(^{3}\)/s) allowed during reheat operation (see detailed explanation above). This field is autosizable and its default is autosize. If autosize is selected or the field is blank, the value is filled from the similar inputs in \hyperref[sizingzone]{Sizing:Zone}. If there is no sizing calculation the value is set to 0.002032 m\(^{3}\)/s-m\(^{2}\) (0.4 cfm/ft\(^{2}\)). If this field and the following field are entered, the greater of the two inputs is used. This field and the following field are only used if Damper Heating Action = ReverseWithLimits.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Flow Fraction During Reheat}\label{field-maximum-flow-fraction-during-reheat}

This fraction is multiplied by the Maximum Air Flow Rate to determine the maximum volume flow rate (m\(^{3}\)/s) allowed during reheat operation (see detailed explanation above). This field is autosizeable and is defaulted to autosize. If autosizeable is selected or the field is blank, the value is set to 0.002032 m\(^{3}\)/s-m\(^{2}\) (0.4 cfm/ft\(^{2}\)) multiplied by the zone floor area divided by the Maximum Air Flow Rate. If this field and the previous field are entered, the greater of the two inputs is used. This field and the following field are only used if Damper Heating Action = ReverseWithLimits.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Reheat Air Temperature}\label{field-maximum-reheat-air-temperature-1}

This field specifies a maximum supply air temperature (°C) leaving the reheat coil in a VAV terminal unit during heating operation. If leaving blank, the temperature of the supply air to the space in heating operation may get unrealistic high.

\paragraph{Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name}\label{field-design-specification-outdoor-air-object-name}

This alpha field specifies the name of a \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorair]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} or \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorairspacelist]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir:SpaceList} object. When this field is used, the terminal unit will increase flow as needed to meet this outdoor air requirement. If Outdoor Air Flow per Person is non-zero, then the outdoor air requirement will be computed based on the current number of occupants in the zone. At no time will the supply air flow rate exceed the value for Maximum Air Flow Rate. If this field is blank, then the terminal unit will not be controlled for outdoor air flow. See documentation for the zone HVAC outdoor air object for further information (Ref \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorair]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir}).

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}

This field adjusts the \textit{Constant Minimum Air Flow Fraction}, \textit{Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate}, or \textit{Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule} value by multiplying it using this schedule. Schedule values are fractions, 0.0 to 1.0. This field adjusts the minimum airflow turndown value below the zone design minimum air flow and is intended for use with ASHRAE Standard 170. This field can also be used to adjust the design minimum air flow sizing calculation by applying a desired fraction values to summer and winter design days turndown schedule. If this field is left blank, then the turndown minimum air flow fraction value is set to 1.

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal VAV Damper Position {[]}}\label{zone-air-terminal-vav-damper-position}

This output is the variable air volume damper position required to meet the zone load. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The damper position is defined as the terminal unit air mass flow rate divided by the terminal unit's maximum air mass flow rate.

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Minimum Air Flow Fraction {[]}}\label{zone-air-terminal-minimum-air-flow-fraction}

This output is the value for the minimum air flow fraction setting on a VAV terminal.~~ This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The minimum air flow fraction is defined as the lower limit on the terminal unit air mass flow rate divided by the terminal units maximum air mass flow rate.

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}}

This output is the amount of outdoor air entering the zone. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The amount of outdoor air is defined as the terminal unit air volume flow rate multiplied by the fraction of outdoor air entering the air loop's outside air system.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat:VariableSpeedFan}\label{airterminalsingleductvavreheatvariablespeedfan}

The VAV terminal unit with variable-speed fan and reheat coil is an air system terminal unit consisting of a variable speed fan in series with a heating coil. These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum -- usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates -- one for heating and one for cooling.

For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the heating coil output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. The zone fan-off minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field \textit{Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.

This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component -- a variable speed fan and a heating coil in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through -- the fan is upstream of the heating coil.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Zone Air Terminal VAV Damper Position {[]}
\item
  HVAC,Average,Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal VAV Damper Position}\label{zone-air-terminal-vav-damper-position-1}

This output is the variable air volume flow fraction required to meet the zone load. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The flow fraction is defined as the terminal unit air mass flow rate divided by the terminal unit's maximum air mass flow rate.

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}}

This output is the amount of outdoor air entering the zone. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The amount of outdoor air is defined as the terminal unit air volume flow rate multiplied by the fraction of outdoor air entering the air loop's outside air system.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat}\label{airterminalsingleductvavheatandcoolreheat}

Variable air volume (VAV) systems typically control the dry-bulb temperature inside a zone by varying the supply air volume instead of the supply air temperature (ref: \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavnoreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat}). Reheat coils may be required to avoid overcooling (ref: \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat}).

This terminal unit is slightly different from the \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat} terminal unit. Both operate the same in cooling mode: the damper opens as needed to provide additional sensible cooling to the zone. The difference between the two is in heating mode.~ For the Single Duct VAV Reheat terminal unit, the air flow rate is reduced to the minimum value (max air flow rate x zone minimum air flow fraction) when zone heating is required and the reheat coil output is modulated to meet the zone heating load. The zone minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field \textit{Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.~ For the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat terminal unit, the air flow rate in heating mode is increased to meet higher zone heating loads (similar to what is done in cooling mode). If additional heat is required (beyond what the terminal unit can provide with its damper fully open), then the reheat coil is modulated as needed to meet the additional heating load.

This terminal unit model was originally developed and tested for use with the changeover-bypass VAV unitary system.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-4-000}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-4-000}

Unique user-defined name for this Air Distribution Unit (ADU).

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-4}

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether or not this component is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Damper Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-damper-air-outlet-node-name-1}

This alpha field defines the name of the VAV damper air outlet node. This is the outlet node of the damper and the inlet node of the reheat coil.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name-3}

This alpha field defines the name of the air inlet node that connects the air splitter to the individual zone ADU. This is \emph{not} the same as the air inlet node of the reheat component: it is upstream of that node. This is the inlet node to the terminal unit and the damper.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-air-flow-rate-3}

This numeric field defines the design maximum volumetric flow rate (m\(^{3}\)/sec) specified for this VAV ADU. This flow rate must be greater than 0 or can be autosized.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Minimum Air Flow Fraction}\label{field-zone-minimum-air-flow-fraction-1}

This numeric field defines the minimum air volumetric flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate. The minimum zone fraction is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. The reheat coil operates as needed to maintain the heating set point specified in the Zone Control:Thermostatic object. This value must be between 0 and 1.

\paragraph{Field: Reheat Coil Object Type}\label{field-reheat-coil-object-type-2}

The valid reheat component objects currently available are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingwater]{Coil:Heating:Water}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingelectric]{Coil:Heating:Electric}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatinggas-000]{Coil:Heating:Fuel}
\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingsteam]{Coil:Heating:Steam}
\end{itemize}

If no reheat coil is required, use \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavheatandcoolnoreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat} instead of this object.

\paragraph{Field: Reheat Coil Name}\label{field-reheat-coil-name-2}

Unique coil name being simulated with this ADU. Applicable for all coils. If there is no reheat coil, use \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavheatandcoolnoreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat} instead of this object.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-hot-water-or-steam-flow-rate-3}

This field is ignored for gas or electric reheat coils. If using a hot water or steam reheat coil, set to the maximum design water or steam volumetric flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s for the hot water or steam heating coil. The steam volume flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. This volumetric flow rate can be autosized.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate}\label{field-minimum-hot-water-or-steam-flow-rate-3}

This field is ignored for gas and electric coils. Set to the minimum design water or steam volumetric flow rate in m\(^{3}\)/s for the hot water or steam heating coil, normally set to be a shut-off valve that is set to zero. The steam volume flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-air-outlet-node-name-3}

This is the air outlet node for the ADU and is then connected to the zone. This is the same node as the air outlet node of the reheat component.

\paragraph{Field: Convergence Tolerance}\label{field-convergence-tolerance-2}

The coil is controlled by knowing the zone demand determined by the zone thermostat and setting the outlet conditions to meet this demand. For the electric and gas coils, this is set exactly since the coil model solution can be inverted and this field is not used. With the hot water coil that uses an effectiveness-NTU method, the solution cannot be inverted directly. Therefore, to determine the correct mass flow rate for the hot water the solution is solved by iteration. The iterative solution uses an interval-halving routine and needs a termination criterion that is set with this Convergence Tolerance parameter. This control offset is set to a decimal fraction of the zone demand. The default value for this field is 0.001.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Reheat Air Temperature}\label{field-maximum-reheat-air-temperature-2}

This is the upper limit on the temperature in degrees C of the air leaving the terminal unit -- reheat coil (and being delivered to the zone). If the user leaves this field blank, no maximum reheat air temperature is enforced.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}

This field adjusts the \textit{Zone Minimum Air Flow Fraction} by multiplying it using this schedule. Schedule values are fractions, 0.0 to 1.0. This field adjusts the minimum airflow turndown value below the zone design minimum air flow and is intended for use with ASHRAE Standard 170. This field can also be used to adjust the design minimum air flow sizing calculation by applying a desired fraction values to summer and winter design days turndown schedule. If this field is left blank, then the turndown minimum air flow fraction value is set to 1 and uses the fixed fraction specified in the field \textit{Zone Minimum Air Flow Fraction}.

This output is the damper position required to meet the zone load. This is the average value over the simulation timestep being reported. The damper position is defined as the terminal unit air mass flow rate divided by the terminal unit's maximum air mass flow rate.

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}}

This output is the amount of outdoor air entering the zone. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The amount of outdoor air is defined as the terminal unit air volume flow rate multiplied by the fraction of outdoor air entering the air loop's outside air system.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat}\label{airterminalsingleductvavnoreheat}

Variable air volume (VAV) systems control the dry-bulb temperature inside a zone by varying the supply air volume instead of the air temperature. At full cooling the VAV damper is fully open supplying the specified maximum air flow rate. As the cooling load decreases, the damper closes until it reaches the minimum stop specified by the zone minimum air flow fraction. The zone minimum supply air flow can be adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field \textit{Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.

VAV systems can be used for interior or perimeter zones with a common fan system and air temperature control. The VAV concept may vary according to the VAV box locations and air temperature controls. Heating can be provided if necessary by use of baseboard.

This field is used to select how the program will determine the minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating.~ The minimum flow rate is modeled as a fraction of the maximum flow rate.~ There are three choices for selecting how the minimum flow rate is specified:~ Constant, FixedFlowRate, and Scheduled.~ If Constant is entered, then the program will use the value for the constant minimum air flow fraction entered in the following field.~ If FixedFlowRate is entered, then the program will use the value for minimum flow rate entered in the field below called Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate.~ If Scheduled is entered, then the program will obtain the value for minimum flow fraction from the schedule named in the field below called Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name. The default is Constant.

\paragraph{Field: Constant Minimum Air Flow Fraction}\label{field-constant-minimum-air-flow-fraction-1}

The minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate. The minimum zone fraction is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. This field is only used if the Zone Minimum Air Flow Method field is set to Constant.

This field is autosizable and defaulted to autosize. If a Sizing:System \emph{System Outdoor Air Method} other than Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure is specified, the autosized flow fraction is calculated using the maximum flow rate derived from the design outdoor air flow (including VRP adjustments) and the \hyperref[sizingzone]{Sizing:Zone} input fields ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow per Zone Floor Area'', ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow'', and ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow Fraction''. If there is no sizing calculation the defaults of 0.000762 cubic meters per second per square meter of zone floor area (0.15 cfm/ft2) and 0.2 are used. The autosized flow fraction is calculated according to the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 Simplified Procedure if the Sizing:System's ``System Outdoor Air Method'' associated with this terminal is set to Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure.

\paragraph{Field: Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate}\label{field-fixed-minimum-air-flow-rate-1}

The minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fixed minimum air flow rate in meters cubed per second. The minimum air flow rate is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. This field is only used if the Zone Minimum Air Flow Method field is set to FixedFlowRate.

This field is autosizable and defaulted to autosize. The autosized flow rate is the maximum flow rate derived from the design outdoor air flow (including VRP adjustments) and the \hyperref[sizingzone]{Sizing:Zone} input fields ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow per Zone Floor Area'', ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow'', and ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow Fraction''. If there is no sizing calculation the defaults of 0.000762 cubic meters per second per square meter of zone floor area (0.15 cfm/ft2) and 0.2 flow fraction are used. The autosized flow rate is calculated according to the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 Simplified Procedure if the Sizing:System's ``System Outdoor Air Method'' associated with this terminal is set to Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name}\label{field-minimum-air-flow-fraction-schedule-name-1}

The name of a schedule that determines the value of the minimum air flow fraction.~ The schedule should contain fractions from 0.0 to 1.0.~ These values will define the minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate. This field is only used if the Zone Minimum Air Flow Method field is set to Scheduled.

\paragraph{Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name}\label{field-design-specification-outdoor-air-object-name-1}

This alpha field specifies the name of a \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorair]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} or \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorairspacelist]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir:SpaceList} object. When this field is used, the terminal unit will increase flow as needed to meet this outdoor air requirement. If Outdoor Air Flow per Person is non-zero, then the outdoor air requirement will be computed based on the current number of occupants in the zone. At no time will the supply air flow rate exceed the value for Maximum Air Flow Rate. If this field is blank, then the terminal unit will not be controlled for outdoor air flow. See documentation for the zone HVAC outdoor air object for further information (Ref \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorair]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir}).

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}

This field adjusts the \textit{Constant Minimum Air Flow Fraction}, \textit{Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate}, or \textit{Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule} value by multiplying it using this schedule. Schedule values are fractions, 0.0 to 1.0. This field adjusts the minimum airflow turndown value below the zone design minimum air flow and is intended for use with ASHRAE Standard 170. This field can also be used to adjust the design minimum air flow sizing calculation by applying a desired fraction values to summer and winter design days turndown schedule. If this field is left blank, then the turndown minimum air flow fraction value is set to 1.

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal VAV Damper Position {[]}}\label{zone-air-terminal-vav-damper-position-3}

This output is the damper position required to meet the zone load. This is the average value over the simulation timestep being reported. The damper position is defined as the terminal unit air mass flow rate divided by the terminal unit's maximum air mass flow rate.

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}}

This output is the amount of outdoor air entering the zone. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The amount of outdoor air is defined as the terminal unit air volume flow rate multiplied by the fraction of outdoor air entering the air loop's outside air system.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat}\label{airterminalsingleductvavheatandcoolnoreheat}

Variable air volume (VAV) systems typically control the dry-bulb temperature inside a zone by varying the supply air volume instead of the supply air temperature (ref: \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavnoreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat}). Reheat coils may be required to avoid overcooling (ref: \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat}).

This terminal unit is slightly different from the \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavnoreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat} terminal unit. Both operate the same in cooling mode: the damper opens as needed to provide additional sensible cooling to the zone. The difference between the two is in heating mode. For the Single Duct VAV NoReheat terminal unit, the air flow rate is reduced to the minimum value (max air flow rate x zone minimum air flow fraction) when zone heating is required. The zone minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field \textit{Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}. For the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat terminal unit, the air flow rate in heating mode is increased to meet higher zone heating loads (similar to what is done in cooling mode).

This terminal unit model was originally developed and tested for use with the changeover-bypass VAV unitary system. This object may be used when the central heating coil is sufficient to maintain the heating set point temperature. Additional heating may be provided, if necessary, by use of \hyperref[airterminalsingleductvavheatandcoolreheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat} or ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:* objects.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat}\label{airterminalsingleductseriespiureheat}

The series powered induction unit is an air system terminal unit that mixes varying amounts of secondary (recirculated) air and primary (conditioned supply) air to produce a fixed flow of air to a zone. The unit contains a small fan that acts to induce the secondary air and a heating coil for heating the mixed secondary and primary air. The fan runs at a constant volume flow rate whenever the unit is on (and the fan's availability schedule is on or it is activated by an availability manager). The fan is downstream of the primary and secondary air inlets. The variable mixing is accomplished by a damper in the unit's primary air supply inlet duct. This damper can move from fully open (100\% primary air. 0\% secondary air) to a minimum stop that is specified in the input description. At full cooling the damper will be fully open. At minimum cooling and for heating the damper will be at the minimum stop and the secondary air flow will be at its maximum. During night cycle operation, if the availability manager status is CycleOnZoneFansOnly, then the fan will run only if there is a heating load.  If the status is CycleOn, then the fan will run according to the normal controls.


The EnergyPlus model of the series PIU terminal unit is composed of three components: a zone mixer, a constant volume fan, and a heating coil (hot water, electric, or gas).

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the unit can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-air-flow-rate-6}

The name of a fan component which composes part of the unit. Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be the same as the maximum air flow rate of the PIU and the type of fan object must be \hyperref[fansystemmodel]{Fan:SystemModel} or \hyperref[fanconstantvolume]{Fan:ConstantVolume}. The fan's inlet node should be the same as the zone mixer's outlet node. The fan's outlet node should be the same as the heating coil's air inlet node. The secondary fan will run only when the Availability Schedule specified in the fan object is >0 or when it is overridden by an availability manager (ref. \hyperref[availabilitymanagernightcycle]{AvailabilityManager:NightCycle} and others).

\paragraph{Field: Convergence Tolerance}\label{field-convergence-tolerance-3}

The control tolerance for the unit heating output. The unit is controlled by matching the unit output to the zone demand. For units with water coils, the model must be numerically inverted to obtain a specified output. The convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the numerical inversion procedure. Basically, this is the fraction:

\begin{equation}
\frac{{\left| {{Q_{PIU,out}} - {Q_{zone\;load}}} \right|}}{{{Q_{zone\;load}}}} \le ConvergenceTolerance
\end{equation}

For gas or electric heating coils, this input should be left blank. The default is 0.001.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ParallelPIU:Reheat}\label{airterminalsingleductparallelpiureheat}

The parallel powered induction unit is an air system terminal unit that mixes varying amounts of secondary (recirculated) air and primary (conditioned supply) air to produce a variable total flow of air to a zone. The unit contains a small fan that acts to induce the secondary air and a heating coil for heating the mixed secondary and primary air. The secondary and primary air streams enter the unit in parallel. The fan sits in the secondary air stream and runs only when the primary air flow is below the Fan On Flow Fraction and the fan's availability schedule is on or it is activated by an availability manager. The primary air inlet contains a damper that can move from fully open (maximum primary air) to a minimum stop (minimum primary air).

At full cooling load the primary air damper is fully open and the fan is off. The primary air flow is at maximum and there is little or no secondary air flow. As the cooling load decreases, the primary air damper gradually closes and the secondary air flow remains close to zero. At some point, usually when the primary air flow has reached the minimum, the fan switches on and secondary air is induced. The heating coil will switch on as needed to meet any heating demand. The Fan On Flow Fraction field controls the fan operation; see this field description for more details.

The EnergyPlus model of the parallel PIU terminal unit is composed of three components: a constant volume fan, a zone mixer, and a heating coil (hot water, electric, or gas).

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the unit can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Primary Air Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-primary-air-flow-rate-1}

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Secondary Air Flow Rate}\label{field-maximum-secondary-air-flow-rate}

The maximum volumetric air flow rate of secondary air through the unit in cubic meters per second. This flow rate can be any amount but is commonly less than the maximum primary air flow rate.

\end{equation}

For gas or electric heating coils, this input should be left blank. The default is 0.001.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeInduction}\label{airterminalsingleductconstantvolumefourpipeinduction}

The four pipe induction terminal unit provides local hot water heating or chilled water cooling of induced zone air which then mixes with centrally conditioned supply air. An air conditioning system consisting of these terminal units is effectively a mixed central air / local hydronic system. The centrally conditioned air supplied to the induction terminal units is constant volume at quite high pressure. The central air is discharged through a nozzle in the terminal unit, inducing a flow of room air over a hydronic heating/cooling coil. The coil is connected either to a single inlet and outlet pipe (2 pipe unit) or to 2 inlets and 2 outlets (4 pipe unit). The heated or cooled induced air mixes with the centrally conditioned air before being discharged into the zone. The terminal units are usually expected to do only sensible cooling -- any dehumidification is done by the central air conditioning system.

The EnergyPlus model of the four pipe induction terminal unit is a compound component consisting of a hot water heating coil, a chilled water cooling coil, and an air mixer. The unit has two inlet air streams: the centrally conditioned supply air and the induced air from the zone. The induced air passes first through the heating coil, then through the cooling coil and finally through the mixer. The central supply air goes directly into the mixer. The water flow through the hot or cold water coil is varied to meet the zone air conditioning requirement. Note that EnergyPlus models the four pipe induction terminal unit as having separate heating and cooling coils whereas real units have only a single coil used for both heating and cooling. Note also that the four pipe induction unit model can be used to model a two pipe unit by simply adjusting the heating and cooling coil schedules so that the heating coil is off when the cooling coil is on and vice versa.

  HVAC,Average,Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate {[}m3/s{]}}

This output is the amount of outdoor air entering the zone. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The amount of outdoor air is defined as the terminal unit air volume flow rate multiplied by the fraction of outdoor air entering the air loop's outside air system.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeBeam}\label{airterminalsingleductconstantvolumefourpipebeam}

The four-pipe beam air terminal system is a mixed air-hydronic system. A central, single-duct forced-air system that supplies conditioned air to the zones. Chilled water circulates through ceiling-mounted fin-tube convector units to provide sensible cooling. Hot water circulates through the same convectors to provide heating. Water flow rate through the beam unit is varied to meet the zone sensible cooling or heating load. Any dehumidification is done by the central forced-air system. Thermodynamically, the cooled beam system resembles the four-pipe induction unit (\textbf{\hyperref[airterminalsingleductconstantvolumefourpipeinduction]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeInduction}}).

To model a typical four-pipe beam system the user will need to define a conventional central constant volume forced air system in order to deliver primary air to the beam. This central system (usually) provides outside air for ventilation. Primary air is normally delivered at a fixed temperature but could be reset by a schedule or using an outdoor air reset setpoint manager. On the supply side of this air loop there will be the usual central conditioning equipment: outside air mixer, fan, heating and cooling coil. On the zone equipment (demand) side of the loop, the four-pipe beams will be represented as air terminal units. Because the four-pipe beam can provide heating the system can avoid over-cooling zones during times of low load with cool primary air temperatures, similar to the action of a reheat coil in a VAV terminal. Therefore, it is not necessary to have additional zone equipment (such as baseboard heaters) to handle heating (or reheating) loads.

Although the four-pipe beam equipment in a zone is treated by the program as a single terminal unit, the actual installation will often have multiple beam units in each zone. In this model, it is only the total length of all the beams and the total air flow of all the units that are described, not the number of individual beam units.

If needed, the program (in its sizing calculation for the system) determines the total length of beams and primary supply air flow that is needed to meet the zone design loads. The four pipe beam air terminal sizing differs from other air terminals in that the primary supply air flow rate is sized using the entire performance model and the flow rate is not the direct result from the \hyperref[sizingzone]{Sizing:Zone} and \hyperref[sizingsystem]{Sizing:System} calculations. The flow rates will be somewhere between what an air terminal would size out using \emph{VentilationRequirement} or \emph{Sensible} in the \hyperref[sizingsystem]{Sizing:System} object (either setting can be used).

The model includes two different types of inputs for flow rates, ``design'' and ``rated \ldots{} per-meter.'' The design values are the actual sizes of the flow rates as viewed from the zone and central air handler (but before zone multipliers). The design values include all the individual beam units and their lengths. The rated per-meter values are used to characterize product performance at nominal rating conditions in such a way that it can be scaled to match the size of a zone. The performance characteristics at the rating point are not fixed in the program and can be entered by the user when they differ from default values. The rated per meter values are normalized by the linear dimensions of the beam and are generally obtained from product catalog data by dividing by the length of the beam. The rated primary air flow rate is assumed to be for sea level conditions while the design primary air flow rate is modeled for the location elevation above sea level.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:CooledBeam}\label{airterminalsingleductconstantvolumecooledbeam}

The Cooled Beam system is a mixed air-hydronic system. A central, single-duct forced-air system supplies conditioned ventilation air to the zones. Sensible cooling is done by chilled water circulating through ceiling mounted cooled beam units. Chilled water flow rate through the cooled beam units is varied to meet the zone sensible cooling load. Any dehumidification is done by the central ventilation air system. Heating is usually accomplished with hot water radiators. Thermodynamically, the cooled beam system resembles the four-pipe induction unit.

To model a typical cooled beam system the user will need to define a conventional central constant volume forced air system. This system will normally be 100\% outside air delivered at a fixed supply temperature (which could be reset by schedule or by outside air temperature). On the supply side of this air loop there will be the usual central AC equipment: outside air mixer, fan, heating and cooling coil. On the zone equipment (demand) side of the loop, the chilled beams will be represented as terminal units. Additional zone equipment (such as baseboard heaters) will be needed to handle heating loads.

Although the cooled beam equipment in a zone is treated by the program as a single terminal unit, the actual installation will have multiple beams in each zone. The program (in its sizing calculation for the system) figures out how many beams of what length are needed to meet the zone design load.

\subsection{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}\label{airterminalsingleductmixer}

The air terminal mixer provides a means of supplying central system air either to air inlet or supply side of a ZoneHVAC equipment such as a four pipe fan coil. Normally the central air would be ventilation air from a dedicated outside air system (DOAS).

This terminal mixer object mixes conditioned outdoor air (primary air) from DOAS air loop and recirculating (secondary air) and deliver it either to inlet or supply side of a local ZoneHVAC equipment. The terminal mixer can be connected either to the inlet or supply side of the local ZoneHVAC equipment and the connection type is specified in the input field \textit{Mixer Connection Type}. If the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer object is connected to the supply side, a mix of conditioned outdoor air from a central dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with conditioned recirculation air from the local ZoneHVAC equipment is supplied as a single stream to the conditioned zone at its inlet node. If the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer object is connected to the inlet side, a mix of outdoor air from the a central dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with un-conditioned recirculation air from a zone exhaust node is supplied to the ZoneHVAC equipment inlet node. The mixer model will sum the two air streams and average the air properties. The AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer is used with:

The secondary air (recirculating air) inlet node name of the mixer. This will be the outlet air node name of the ZoneHVAC equipment if the connection type in the input field \textit{Mixer Connection Type} below is \textbf{SupplySide}, or else this will be either an exhaust air node name of the conditioned zone (Ref. \hyperref[zonehvacequipmentconnections]{ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} to draw air from a zone directly or an induced air outlet node (Ref. \hyperref[airloophvacreturnplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum}) to draw air from a return plenum when the zone return node is connected to a return plenum.  The induced air outlet node will be the outlet air node name when the mixer connection type is SupplySide. If the mixer connection type is InletSide, then the induced air outlet node will be the mixer secondary air inlet node.

This input field allows user to specify the mixer connection type. Valid choices are \textbf{InletSide} or \textbf{SupplySide}. This is a required input field. If the mixer connection type selected is \textbf{InletSide}, then the mixer is connected on the inlet side of the ZoneHVAC equipment, or else if the mixer connection type selected is \textbf{SupplySide}, then the mixer is connected at the outlet side of the ZoneHVAC equipment.\\

\paragraph{Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name}\label{field-DSOA-object-name}

This field allows modifying the behavior of this air terminal so that it is modulated to supply the required outdoor air to the zone.  This field is optional. When the name of an \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorair]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} or \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorairspacelist]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir:SpaceList} object is entered, the model is changed to adjust the flow rate to provide the volume of outdoor air described by that object.  This feature allows modeling demand controlled ventilation on a zone-by-zone basis using the Outdoor Air Flow per Person rate (specified in the \hyperref[designspecificationoutdoorair]{DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} object) and the number of occupants (specified in the \hyperref[people]{People} object schedules).  If the outdoor air fraction of the supply air is 1.0, as for a dedicated outdoor air system, the air flow rate will match the outdoor air requirement.  When the outdoor air fraction is less than 1.0, as for a recirculating air system, the terminal air flow will be modulated upward to account for the increased total air flow needed to provide the required flow rate of outdoor air.   The total air flow rate will not exceed the Maximum Air Flow Rate specified above. The volume flow rate is converted to mass flow rate using the standard density of air at Pressure = 101325 Pa, Temperature = 20C, and Humidity Ratio = 0.0.

\paragraph{Field: Per Person Ventilation Rate Mode}

This field specifies how the outdoor air ventilation rates are calculated when based on a rate per person.~ It can be either based on the current number of people as affected by time-varying occupancy schedules, or on the constant value for the maximum number of people.~~ Enter the key CurrentOccupancy for the former and DesignOccupancy for the later.

\subsection{AirTerminal:DualDuct:ConstantVolume}\label{airterminaldualductconstantvolume}

The AirTerminal:DualDuct:ConstantVolume simulation or the typical Multizone is described by this Air Distribution Unit (ADU). Multizone systems condition all the air in a central apparatus and distribute it to the conditioned zones through two parallel ducts. One duct carries cold air and the other warm air, providing air sources for both heating and cooling at all times. In each conditioned zone, a mixing valve responsive to a room thermostat mixes the warm and cold air in proper proportions to satisfy the prevailing heating or cooling load of the space. The Multizone ADU is the specific component that leads to the zone containing the mixer and the mixing damper and then connecting to the zone. The total airflow to each room is kept constant while the proportion of hot air to cold air is adjusted to maintain the temperature in each zone at the desired level.

This output is the damper position of the cold air stream in a dual duct air terminal. This is the average value over the frequency being reported. The damper position is defined as the terminal unit cold air mass flow rate divided by the terminal unit's maximum cold air mass flow rate. This output is dimensionless and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.

\paragraph{Zone Air Terminal Hot Supply Duct Damper Position}\label{zone-air-terminal-hot-supply-duct-damper-position}

\subsection{AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV}\label{airterminaldualductvav}

AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV (i.e., Dual duct variable air volume (DDVAV)) systems are used to obtain zone temperature control by mixing the cold and warm air in various volume combinations. The fan is sized for the anticipated maximum coincident hot or cold volume, not the sum of the instantaneous peaks. This system has an advantage of a true single path VAV system, except for warm port leakage. When cold air is modulated for control before mixing, it operates similar to the VAV induction when mixing occurs without hot deck reheat. It is similar to a reheat system when mixing occurs while the hot deck is using the reheat coil. It uses more energy than a true VAV system, but less than a constant volume dual duct system.

The zone minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field \textit{Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.

When this field is used, the terminal unit will increase flow as needed to meet this outdoor air requirement. If Outdoor Air Flow per Person is non-zero, then the outdoor air requirement will be computed based on the current number of occupants in the zone. At no time will the supply air flow rate exceed the value for Maximum Air Flow Rate. If this field is blank, then the terminal unit will not be controlled for outdoor air flow.

This field can also be used to adjust the design minimum air flow sizing calculation by applying a desired fraction values to summer and winter design days turndown schedule. If this field is left blank, then the turndown minimum air flow fraction value is set to 1 and the VAV air terminal uses the fixed fraction specified in in the field \textit{Zone Minimum Air Flow Fraction}.

\subsection{AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV:OutdoorAir}\label{airterminaldualductvavoutdoorair}

AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV:OutdoorAir provides a model for a type of dual duct air system in which one duct provides outdoor air ventilation and the other provides VAV cooling.~ The Outdoor Air stream and the Recirculated Air stream are conditioned and supplied through separate air streams as part of a centralized dedicated outdoor air~ (DOAS) distribution system. The dual duct arrangement allows the ventilation air to be controlled separately using schedules or occupancy demand while the recirculated air is controlled to meet the dry-bulb zone temperature setpoint. The two airstreams remain decoupled until the terminal box where they are mixed. The terminal unit is meant for systems regulating outdoor air based only on demand control or code minimum settings and not on economizer operation.

This air terminal does not have heating coils and is not configured for conditions zones that need heat. Additional ZoneHVAC equipment, such as baseboards or fan coil units, are needed to provide heating to the zone when using this air terminal.

Although this air terminal is primarily for dual duct system, it is allowed to use just the outdoor air side in a single duct system. This can be useful for modeling single duct DOAS when the required volume of outdoor air varies over time.
