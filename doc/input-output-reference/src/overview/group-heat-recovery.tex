\subsection{HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate}\label{heatexchangerairtoairflatplate}

The air-to-air flat plate heat exchanger is an HVAC component typically used for exhaust or relief air heat recovery. The user can choose the flow arrangement type: counter flow, parallel flow, or cross flow with both streams unmixed. The input requires no geometric data. Performance is defined by specifying primary outlet air temperature at nominal (user specified) inlet conditions. In addition, the ratio (h\(^{.}\)A)\(_{p}\) / (h\(^{.}\)A)\(_{s}\) at nominal flow needs to be input, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, p stands for primary side, s for secondary side.

If the heat exchanger is operated in conjunction with an outdoor air economizer (economizer lockout set to \emph{Yes}), the nominal supply air flow rate should be set equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate specified in the \hyperref[controlleroutdoorair]{Controller:OutdoorAir}. The heat exchanger detects that the economizer is operating by the fact that its inlet air flow rate is greater than its nominal supply air flow rate.

The sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger is an HVAC component typically used for exhaust or relief air heat recovery (Figure 150). Heat exchanger performance can be specified to transfer sensible energy, latent energy or both between the supply and exhaust air streams. The input requires no geometric data. Performance is defined by specifying sensible and/or latent effectiveness at 75\% and 100\% of the nominal (rated) supply air flow rate at two operating conditions as shown in Table~\ref{table:operating-conditions-for-defining-heat}.

This object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger. Heat exchange between the supply and exhaust air streams occurs whenever the unit is scheduled to be available (Availability schedule) and supply/exhaust air flow is present. This heat exchanger object can be used in conjunction with a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify ModulateFlow in the \hyperref[controlleroutdoorair]{Controller:OutdoorAir} object), whereby heat exchange is suspended whenever the air-side economizer (or high humidity control) is active (i.e., air flow is fully bypassed around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger is stopped). This object is also able to suspend heat exchange for the purpose of providing free cooling operation in the absence of a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify MinimumFlowWithBypass in the \hyperref[controlleroutdoorair]{Controller:OutdoorAir} object).

During winter weather, humid exhaust air entering the heat exchanger can form frost on the cold heat exchanger surfaces, which can reduce air flow and the amount of energy recovery. Several methods are used to control or eliminate frost formation, and the following types can be modeled for this heat exchanger object: supply air preheat, minimum exhaust air temperature, exhaust air recirculation and exhaust only. For preheat frost control, a separate heating coil object must be placed in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the frost threshold temperature. The other frost control types are modeled within this object itself (i.e., do not require a separate object to be defined) based on alpha and numeric inputs to this heat exchanger object.

Air-to-air heat exchangers are sometimes controlled to maintain a fixed supply air outlet temperature to avoid overheating when the heat exchanger is heating the supply (primary) air. To model this control in EnergyPlus, a set point manager object is used to establish a temperature set point at the supply air outlet node of the heat exchanger. Wheel speed modulation or plate supply air bypass is used to control the supply air exiting conditions to this set point. The set point for supply air temperature control should be set at the minimum economizer temperature set point if an air-side economizer is also being used by the air system. If frost control and supply air outlet temperature control are used, frost control takes precedence over supply air temperature control (e.g., frost control defrost time fraction is determined as if wheel speed modulation or plate supply air bypass is not used).

To model a sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger located in an air loop, the input data file should include the following objects:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystem]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}
\item
  \hyperref[controlleroutdoorair]{Controller:OutdoorAir}
\item
  \hyperref[outdoorairmixer]{OutdoorAir:Mixer}

\item
  \hyperref[coilheatingwater]{Coil:Heating:Water}, \hyperref[coilheatingelectric]{Coil:Heating:Electric} or \hyperref[coilheatinggas-000]{Coil:Heating:Fuel} (if preheat frost control is to be modeled)
\item
  \hyperref[setpointmanagerscheduled]{SetpointManager:Scheduled} (if supply air outlet temperature control is used)
\end{itemize}

The sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger can also be used in a number of other applications, including conditioning outdoor ventilation air and supplying it directly to a zone without an air loop. See object \hyperref[zonehvacenergyrecoveryventilator]{ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator} for further details on this specific application.

A description of each input field for this object is provided below.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-019}

The name of the HVAC system node from which the unit draws its exhaust (secondary) inlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Exhaust Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-exhaust-air-outlet-node-name}

The name of the HVAC system node to which the unit sends its exhaust (secondary) outlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Nominal Electric Power}\label{field-nominal-electric-power-1}

The electric consumption rate of the unit in watts. Electric power is considered constant whenever the unit operates. This numeric input can be used to model electric power consumption by controls (transformers, relays, etc.) and/or a motor for a rotary heat exchanger. None of this electric power contributes thermal load to the supply or exhaust air streams. The default value for this field is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Supply Air Outlet Temperature Control}\label{field-supply-air-outlet-temperature-control}

This alpha field determines if the heat exchanger's supply air outlet is controlled to a temperature set point when the heat exchanger is actively conditioning the supply (primary) air. The choices for this input field are Yes or No, with the default being No. When supply air outlet temperature control is used, the wheel rotational speed modulates or supply air is bypassed around the plate heat exchanger to maintain the desired setpoint temperature. A setpoint manager object is required to establish the desired set point at the supply air outlet node (reference: \hyperref[setpointmanagerscheduled]{SetpointManager:Scheduled}). When an air-side economizer is also being modeled for this air system, the heat exchanger is deactivated during economizer operation. Additionally, the set point for the supply air outlet temperature control should be equal to the economizer outdoor air temperature lower limit (reference: \hyperref[controlleroutdoorair]{Controller:OutdoorAir}, field Economizer Minimum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature), however, any temperature set point may be used.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Exchanger Type}\label{field-heat-exchanger-type}

This alpha field denotes the type of heat exchanger being modeled: Plate (e.g., fixed plate) or Rotary (e.g., rotating cylinder or wheel). The default choice for this field is Plate . The heat exchanger type affects the modeling of frost control options and supply air outlet temperature control. For rotary heat exchangers, rotational speed is varied to control frost formation or the supply air outlet temperature. For plate exchangers, air bypass around the heat exchanger is used to obtain the desired effect.

\paragraph{Field: Frost Control Type}\label{field-frost-control-type}

This alpha field has four choices: None, ExhaustAirRecirculation, ExhaustOnly and MinimumExhaustTemperature. If this field is left blank, the default frost control type is None . For modeling preheat frost control, specify None for this input field and insert a separate heating coil object in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the desired frost threshold temperature.

\emph{ExhaustAirRecirculation}: dampers are used to direct exhaust air back into the zone through the supply side of the heat exchanger when the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature falls below a threshold temperature (defined in the next input field). The fraction of time that exhaust air is circulated through the supply side of the heat exchanger is dependent on the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature with respect to the threshold temperature, the initial defrost time fraction, and the rate of change of defrost time fraction (see \emph{Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase}). When exhaust air is being recirculated, no supply (outdoor ventilation) air is being provided through the heat exchanger unit (which may or may not be acceptable regarding ventilation for occupants).

\emph{ExhaustOnly (supply air bypass)}: this control cycles off the supply air flow through the heat exchanger for a certain period of time while the exhaust air continues to flow through the exhaust side of the heat exchanger. The fraction of time that the supply flow through the heat exchanger is cycled off is dependent on the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature with respect to the threshold temperature, the initial defrost time fraction, and the rate of change of defrost time fraction (see \emph{Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase}). When implemented in real applications, provisions are usually made to avoid building depressurization when this frost control is operating (automatic or pressure-operated dampers, or a bypass air damper around the supply side of the heat exchanger). For this frost control type, it is assumed that the supply air is bypassed around the heat exchanger during frost control operation (i.e., the total supply flow is not reduced during defrost, but merely bypassed around the heat exchanger).

\emph{MinimumExhaustTemperature}: the temperature of the exhaust air leaving the heat exchanger is monitored and the heat exchanger effectiveness is decreased (by slowing heat exchanger rotation or bypassing supply air around the plate exchanger) to keep the exhaust air from falling below the threshold temperature.

\paragraph{Field: Threshold Temperature}\label{field-threshold-temperature}

This numeric field defines the dry-bulb temperature of air which is used to initiate frost control. The default value is 1.7 °C. For ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control, the threshold temperature defines the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature below which frost control is active. For MinimumExhaustTemperature frost control, heat exchanger effectiveness is controlled to keep the exhaust air outlet temperature from falling below this threshold temperature value.

The appropriate threshold temperature varies with exhaust (inlet) air temperature and humidity, frost control type, heat exchanger type, and whether the heat exchanger transfers sensible energy alone or both sensible and latent energy (enthalpy). Typical threshold temperatures are provided in Table~\ref{table:typical-threshold-temperatures} below. However, it is recommended that the user consult manufacturer's information for the specific air-to-air heat exchanger being modeled.

This field is only used for the ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control types. The value for this field must be ≥ 0 and ≤ 1. The default time fraction is 0.083 (e.g., 5 min / 60 min) which is typical for ExhaustAirRecirculation frost control. Higher initial defrost time fractions (e.g., 0.167 = 10 min / 60 min) are typically required for ExhaustOnly frost control. For best results, the user should obtain this information from the manufacturer.

\paragraph{Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase}\label{field-rate-of-defrost-time-fraction-increase}

This numeric field defines the rate of increase in the defrost time fraction as the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature falls below the threshold temperature. This field is only used for the ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control types. The value for this field must be ≥ 0. The default value is 0.012 (e.g., 0.72 min / 60 min per degree C temperature difference) which is typical for ExhaustAirRecirculation frost control. Higher values (e.g., 0.024 = 1.44 min / 60 min per degree C temperature difference) are typically required for ExhaustOnly frost control. For best results, the user should obtain this information from the manufacturer.

This value is used to determine the total defrost time fraction as follows:


Total defrost time fraction = Initial Defrost Time Fraction +
Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase * (\(T_{threshold}\) - \(T_{supply air inlet}\))

The model does not allow the total defrost time fraction to exceed 1.0 or be less than 0.

\paragraph{Field: Economizer Lockout}\label{field-economizer-lockout-1}

This input denotes whether the heat exchanger unit is locked out (bypassed for plate type heat exchangers or the rotation is suspended for rotary type heat exchangers) when the air-side economizer is operating. Both the economizer and high humidity control (Ref. \hyperref[controlleroutdoorair]{Controller:OutdoorAir}) activate the heat exchanger lockout as specified by this input. The input choices are \emph{Yes} (meaning locked out) or \emph{No}. The default input for this field is Yes.

\subsection{HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow}\label{heatexchangerdesiccantbalancedflow}

This desiccant heat exchanger object is an HVAC component used to model both temperature (sensible) and moisture (latent) heat exchange between two air streams (Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-the-balanced-flow-desiccant-heat}). The model assumes balanced air flow through the regeneration and process sides of the heat exchanger (i.e., regeneration and process air volume flow rates and face velocities are the same). Heat exchanger performance is specified through a performance data type object (e.g., \hyperref[heatexchangerdesiccantbalancedflowperformancedatatype1]{HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1}).

\begin{figure}[hbtp] % fig 151

\caption{Schematic of the Balanced Flow Desiccant Heat Exchanger \protect \label{fig:schematic-of-the-balanced-flow-desiccant-heat}}
\end{figure}

Currently, this desiccant heat exchanger model can be referenced by two compound objects: \hyperref[coilsystemcoolingdxheatexchangerassisted]{CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted} and \hyperref[dehumidifierdesiccantsystem]{Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System}, both of which are used to provide enhanced dehumidification over conventional systems. If this heat exchanger is referenced by a compound object, the compound object will control heat exchanger operation (i.e., tell the heat exchanger if heat exchange is needed or not for each simulation timestep).

This desiccant heat exchanger object may also be specified directly in an \hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC} (air loop \hyperref[branchlist]{BranchList}) or in an \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystem]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem} (\hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystemequipmentlist]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList}) without being referenced by a compound object. If specified directly in an \hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC} or \hyperref[airloophvacoutdoorairsystem]{AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}, then the heat exchanger can be controlled to provide heat exchange based on a maximum and/or minimum humidity set point placed on the process air outlet node (ref. Setpoint Managers). If no humidity set points are provided on this node, then heat exchange will be provided whenever the heat exchanger is available to operate (via its availability schedule) and there is a temperature and/or humidity ratio difference between the two air streams.

\subsection{HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1}\label{heatexchangerdesiccantbalancedflowperformancedatatype1}

This object specifies a performance model and model coefficients for a balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger. A \hyperref[heatexchangerdesiccantbalancedflow]{HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow} object will reference a HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1 object. This performance data object is used to specify the thermal performance and electric consumption of the heat exchanger. Some representative inputs for this object are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (PerfCurves.idf and AllDataSets.idf).

This model predicts the regeneration air stream outlet temperature and humidity ratio values based on the entering regeneration and process air stream temperature, humidity ratio and face velocity. The process air stream outlet humidity ratio and temperatures are calculated based on a simple heat and moisture balance. The model requires that the user enter the nominal volumetric flow rate and a nominal face velocity, electric power consumption, empirical model coefficients for the regeneration outlet air temperature and humidity ratio equations, and the applicable minimum and maximum values for both the independent and dependent variables for the empirical model coefficients provided. This model is based on the following equations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The dry-bulb temperature of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the following equation:
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
RTO = B1 + B2*RWI + B3*RTI + B4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + B5*PWI + B6*PTI + B7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + B8*RFV
\end{equation}

where,

\(RTO\) = Regeneration outlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)

\(RWI\) = Regeneration inlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)

\(RTI\) = Regeneration inlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)

\(PWI\) = Process inlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)

\(PTI\) = Process inlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)

\(RFV\) = Regeneration (and process) face velocity (m/s)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The humidity ratio of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the same empirical equation form; however, different coefficients are used as follows:
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
RWO = C1 + C2*RWI + C3*RTI + C4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + C5*PWI + C6*PTI + C7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + C8*RFV
\end{equation}

where,

\(RWO\) = Regeneration outlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The process outlet air conditions are then calculated based on the regeneration outlet air conditions (temperature or humidity ratio) calculated above, the actual regeneration inlet air conditions entering the heat exchanger, and assuming the same amount of sensible and total energy transfer across both the process and regeneration sides of the heat exchanger. The difference between the actual inlet air conditions and RTI/RWI/PTI/PWI is made here because user-defined limits for RTI/RWI/PTI/PWI may result in a difference between the actual conditions and those used in the equations shown above (see the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for further discussion).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Nominal Air Face Velocity}\label{field-nominal-air-face-velocity}

This numeric field contains the nominal air velocity across the heat exchanger face area in meters per second. It is assumed that this air velocity is the same for both sides of the heat exchanger. This value, along with the Nominal Air Flow Rate sets the heat exchanger face area. With this fixed face area, the air face velocity is calculated every simulation timestep based on the actual air volume flow rate for the timestep. The minimum value should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 6. The default value is 3.0.

\paragraph{Field: Nominal Electric Power}\label{field-nominal-electric-power-2}

This numeric field contains the nominal electric consumption rate of the heat exchanger in watts. This electric power is considered constant and is consumed only when the heat exchanger operates (e.g., for all or a portion of the simulation timestep, as appropriate). This numeric input can be used to model electric power consumption by controls (transformers, relays, etc.) and/or a motor for a rotary heat exchanger.
