\section{Group -- Air Path}\label{group-air-path}

\subsection{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath, AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath}\label{airloophvacsupplypath-airloophvacreturnpath}

The zone supply and return air paths are used to describe the configuration of the flow path that the supply air takes in moving from the main air handler to the zone terminal units and that the return air takes on leaving the zones and returning to the central return air duct. The air paths consist of a group of components \hyperref[airloophvaczonesplitter]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter}s and \hyperref[airloophvacsupplyplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum}s for the supply path and \hyperref[airloophvacreturnplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum}s and \hyperref[airloophvaczonemixer]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer}s for the return path. The connectivity of the paths is established by the components node connections. There are no branches defined in the zone air path constructs.

For a typical single duct air system there will be one \hyperref[airloophvacsupplypath]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath} and one \hyperref[airloophvacreturnpath]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath}. A typical dual duct system would have 2 \hyperref[airloophvacsupplypath]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath}s one for the hot air and one for the cold air and 1 \hyperref[airloophvacreturnpath]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath}.

The \hyperref[airloophvacsupplyplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum} component provides the capability to have supply air distributed to the conditioned zones through one or more plenum zones such as would occur in an underfloor air distribution system (UFAD). The \hyperref[airloophvacreturnplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum} component allows the program to model return air plenums. Of course plenums are always optional. The simplest \hyperref[airloophvacsupplypath]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath} would consist of only an \hyperref[airloophvaczonesplitter]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter}; similarly the simplest return air path consists of a single \hyperref[airloophvaczonemixer]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer}. A UFAD system supply air path might consist of a single \hyperref[airloophvaczonesplitter]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter} connecting to multiple \hyperref[airloophvacsupplyplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum}s which in turn could each supply one or more conditioned zones. A system with return plenums would have an \hyperref[airloophvacreturnpath]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath} in which the conditioned zones connect to the return plenum inlets and the outlets of the return plenum connect to a single \hyperref[airloophvaczonemixer]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer}.

Both the zone supply and return plenums are solved in the heat balance as thermal zones which couple through heat conduction with adjacent zones. Since they are solved as thermal zones the solution scheme involves the zone predictor-corrector technique which will lag the temperature at the system timestep in every zone. See Summary of Predictor-Corrector Procedure in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference.

Below are the descriptions of the zone supply and return path statements. Note that each statement type has an identifying name, a single inlet/outlet node name, and a list of component type/name pairs. For a single zone being served by an air loop, the inlet to its air distribution unit and the zone return air outlet can be the zone equipment inlet and outlet nodes directly, thus eliminating the need to specify an \hyperref[airloophvacsupplypath]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath} and an \hyperref[airloophvacreturnpath]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath}.

\subsection{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath}\label{airloophvacsupplypath}

The AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath lists one or more \hyperref[airloophvaczonesplitter]{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter} and \hyperref[airloophvacsupplyplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum} components comprising the path.

\subsection{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum}\label{airloophvacreturnplenum}

The simple building shown in the figure below consists of a controlled zone and a return plenum zone that is used for the return air. This simple configuration contains a ground floor controlled zone with a window and a return plenum zone which handles the roof load. The return air plenum is a special type of component since there is both a heat balance connection and building description and a system airflow connection that transfers the airflow directly from the controlled zone to the return plenum zone in the system air simulation. The input described in this section is mainly just for the system airflow connections in the HVAC algorithms. In addition the return plenum zone must be fully input as a zone object for the heat balance calculation. The zone description needs to contain the wall descriptions - the interzone ceiling and floor, and for this simple case the roof. All the other attributes of a zone that can be specified in the building description can be used with a return plenum zone if necessary: scheduled loads, windows, etc.

These nodes are to be used as the secondary inlet air nodes of powered induction terminal units (See \textbf{\hyperref[airterminalsingleductseriespiureheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat}} and \textbf{\hyperref[airterminalsingleductparallelpiureheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ParallelPIU:Reheat}}).

\paragraph{Field: Inlet \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Node Name}\label{field-inlet-node-name}

The AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum has a heat balance connection and building description, and a system airflow connection which transfers the airflow from the supply plenum zone to the controlled zones in the system simulation. The input described in this section is mainly just for the system airflow connections in the HVAC algorithms. In addition the supply plenum zone must be fully input in the building zone description. The supply plenum zone description needs to contain the wall descriptions, the interzone ceiling and floor, and the ground connection.

The name of a plenum outlet node. There is no limit to the number of outlet nodes, and there may be no duplicate outlet node names.

This is a simple process of summing flows and averaging the air properties. This compoment may be part of an air loop return path or part of an induction terminal unit. When used as a return air mixer, this component must be listed in an \hyperref[airloophvacreturnpath]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath} object, and the inlets may be zone return air nodes or \hyperref[airloophvacreturnplenum]{AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum} outlet nodes. When used in an induction terminal unit (ref. \hyperref[airterminalsingleductseriespiureheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat}, \hyperref[airterminalsingleductparallelpiureheat]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ParallelPIU:Reheat}, and \hyperref[airterminalsingleductconstantvolumefourpipeinduction]{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeInduction}), one inlet node is the supply (primary) air inlet from the central air handler, and the second inlet node is the induced (secondary) air inlet. These node names should match equivalent node names in the terminal unit.

\subsection{AirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem}\label{airloophvacdedicatedoutdoorairsystem}

The AirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem is a central dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) and deliveres outdoor air to multiple \hyperref[airloophvac]{AirLoopHVAC} systems. The amount of delivered outdoor air is based on a sum of outdoor air flow rates from outdoor air stream nodes defined in the \hyperref[outdoorairmixer]{OutdoorAir:Mixer}. These OutdoorAir:Mixer objects are a component of served multiple AirLoopHVAC systems. The central DOAS system also pretreates outdoor air before outdoor air distribution into multiple AirLoopHVAC, with given precool and preheat air conditions.

After the object name, the object has four fields to provide the name of AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem, system availability, and names of AirLoopHVAC:Mixer and AirLoopHVAC:Splitter. The AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem lists a controller to perform controls, and coils and fans to pretreat outdoor air before delivery to served AirLoopHVAC. The Availability Schedule determines times when a system is operationa or shutdownl. The AirLoopHVAC:Mixer and AirLoopHVAC:Splitter provide connection into distribution and relief nodes, respectively.

The next four fields requires inputs for pretreat air conditions, including precooling and preheating.

The last section lists the number of AirLoopHVAC to be served and names of served AirLoopHVAC objects.
