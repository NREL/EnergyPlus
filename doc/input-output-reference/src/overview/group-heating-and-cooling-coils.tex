\section{Group Heating and Cooling Coils}\label{group-heating-and-cooling-coils}

Several different coils may be added to zone equipment and air loops. This includes simple heating (gas, electric, and hot water) and a simple water-cooling coil as well as a more detailed flat fin water-cooling coil model. In general, the heating coil description can be used for a heating coil, a reheat coil, or a preheat coil in the air loop simulation or for zone equipment. Figure~\ref{fig:example-air-loop-heating-cooling-coil} is an example of a heating and cooling coil in the air loop simulation in a dual duct system. This does show the basic node structure that will be referenced in the input description. The figure does show water coils since they are the most complex to input in the simulation compared to the Electric and Gas coils which only have air connections.

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:Water}\label{coilcoolingwater}

The water cooling coil (Coil:Cooling:Water) has the ability to give detailed output with simplified inputs, inputting complicated coil geometry is not required by the user for this model instead the coil is sized in terms of auto-sizeable thermodynamic inputs. The coil requires thermodynamic inputs such as temperatures, mass flow rates and humidity ratios.

The coil is sized using auto-sized/user design input conditions and the UA values are calculated from the design conditions. A rough estimate of the coil area is provided along with percentage of surface wet and/or dry. This model uses the NTU-effectiveness approach to model heat transfer and has two types of flow arrangements cross-flow or counter-flow.

The basic underlying idea is - use auto sizable thermodynamic design inputs, calculate the coil UA s, use these UA values and operating conditions from the nodes connections, calculate the outlet stream conditions, and calculate the heat transfer rates.

See section Cooling Coil Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.

\subsection{Coil:Heating:Desuperheater}\label{coilheatingdesuperheater}

A simplified approach is used to determine the performance of this air heating coil. The model assumes that the heating energy provided by this coil is reclaimed from the superheated refrigerant gas leaving a compressor (i.e., a desuperheating refrigerant-to-air heating coil) and does not impact the performance of the compressor. This coil can be used in air loop simulations but can t be used by certain compound objects (e.g., AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir, AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir, or Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans) or any air distribution equipment (e.g., AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat, AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat, or AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat).

The desuperheater heating coil input requires a coil name, an availability schedule, and a heat reclaim recovery efficiency. The reclaim recovery efficiency determines the amount of heat available for use by this heating coil. Approximately 25-30\% of the energy rejected by typical refrigeration system condensers is to reduce the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature to the condensing temperature. Recovery efficiencies higher than 30\% may cause the refrigerant gas to condense which in turn impacts the performance of the refrigeration system. For this reason, the maximum heat reclaim recovery efficiency for this coil is 30\% for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 30\% limit is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 90\% of the heat within the superheated region.

The next two input items for the desuperheater heating coil are the node names for the inlet and outlet air streams. The following two input fields define the source of heating energy for the coil. This desuperheater heating coil may only be used with direct expansion (DX) cooling or refrigeration equipment. The first of these two inputs is the heating source object type while the second defines the name of the heating source. For proper modeling, the desuperheater heating coil must be placed downstream of a DX cooling coil when reclaiming heat from that cooling coil. Desuperheating heating coil placement is unrestricted when reclaiming heat from a Refrigeration:CompressorRack or Refrigeration:Condenser.

The next input field is optional and defines the set point node name if the desuperheater heating coil is to be controlled based on temperature. When a load-based control scheme is used, this field is left blank. A final optional input is used to model parasitic electric energy use of auxiliary equipment associated with the desuperheater heating coil (e.g., solenoid valve).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-5-013}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-5-009}

This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a desuperheater heating coil. Any reference to this desuperheater heating coil by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-009}

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the desuperheater heating coil can run during a given time period. Schedule values must range from 0 to 1. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the coil can operate during the time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the coil must be off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Reclaim Recovery Efficiency}\label{field-heat-reclaim-recovery-efficiency}

This numeric field defines the ratio of recovered waste heat from the superheated refrigerant gas to the total rejected waste heat from the heating source (as if no heat reclaim occurred). Values can range from 0.0 up to a maximum of 0.9 if the source is a refrigeration condenser and 0.3 for all other waste heat sources. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.8 for a refrigeration condenser source type and 0.25 for all other sources.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name-5-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the desuperheater heating coil draws its inlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-air-outlet-node-name-5-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the desuperheater heating coil sends its outlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Source Object Type}\label{field-heating-source-object-type}

This alpha field defines the source of superheated refrigerant gas from which the desuperheater heating coil recovers energy. Valid choices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
\item
  Refrigeration:CompressorRack
\item
  Refrigeration:Condenser:AirCooled
\item
  Refrigeration:Condenser:EvaporativeCooled
\item
  Refrigeration:Condenser:WaterCooled
\end{itemize}

When the heating coil source is a DX Coil, the air loop's supply air fan control mode may be auto fan (cycling fan cycling coil), constant fan, or variable volume. When the heating source is a compressor rack for refrigerated cases or a refrigeration condenser, the supply air fan control mode should be either variable volume or constant fan.

NOTE: Use of the desuperheater heating coil in variable air volume systems should be done with caution since the model assumption of a fixed heat reclaim recovery efficiency may not be valid if the air flow rate over the coil varies significantly.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Source Name}\label{field-heating-source-name}

This alpha field defines the name of the desuperheater heating coil source (e.g., the name of a specific valid coil (as mentioned in the previous field) which provides waste heat to this desuperheater heating coil).

NOTE: When the heating source is a Refrigeration Compressor rack, the heat rejection location in the Refrigeration:CompressorRack object must be Outdoors . If the compressor rack heat rejection location is Zone , the total amount of heat rejection available for reclaim (e.g., by this desuperheater heating coil) is set to zero by the compressor rack object and the simulation proceeds.

\paragraph{Field: Temperature Setpoint Node Name}\label{field-temperature-setpoint-node-name-3}

This optional alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node used for temperature-based control (e.g., controlling the heating coil s outlet air dry-bulb temperature to a setpoint). If the desuperheater heating coil is temperature controlled through the use of a Set Point Manager, then the control node specified in the Set Point Manager will be entered here. If the desuperheater heating coil is controlled based on a certain heating load to be met (e.g., using this heating coil as part of AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool for high humidity control), this field should be left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Parasitic Electric Load}\label{field-parasitic-electric-load}

This optional numeric field defines the parasitic electric load (in Watts) due to control valves or other devices specific to the desuperheater heating coil. The load is applied whenever the coil is heating the air. The model assumes that this electric load is small and does not contribute to heating the air.

Following is an example input for a desuperheater heating coil.

\paragraph{Heating Coil Heating Rate {[}W{]}}\label{heating-coil-heating-rate-w-3}

This output is the average heating rate to the air of the desuperheater heating coil in Watts over the timestep being reported. This is determined by the coil inlet and outlet air conditions and the air mass flow rate through the coil.

\paragraph{Heating Coil Heating Energy {[}J{]}}\label{heating-coil-heating-energy-j-3}

This output is the total heating output to the air of the desuperheater heating coil in Joules over the timestep being reported. This is determined by the coil inlet and outlet air conditions and the air mass flow rate through the coil.

\paragraph{Heating Coil Runtime Fraction {[]}}\label{heating-coil-runtime-fraction}

This is the runtime fraction of the desuperheater heating coil for the timestep being reported. Since the desuperheater heating coil can only provide heat when the heat source object is active, the runtime fraction of the desuperheater heating coil will always be less than or equal to the runtime fraction of the heat source object.

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow}\label{coilcoolingdxvariablerefrigerantflow}

The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) DX cooling coil model is nearly identical to the single-speed DX cooling coil model (Ref. Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed). For this reason, an adaptation of the single-speed DX cooling coil model is used to model the variable-speed compression system used in VRF AC systems. The model inputs are quite similar to the input requirements for the single-speed DX cooling coil model, however, the location of a majority of the inputs have been moved to the variable refrigerant flow air conditioner object since multiple DX cooling coils will use the same DX compression system (Ref. AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-6-010}

\paragraph{Field: Coil Name}\label{field-coil-name-000}

This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a VRF DX cooling coil. Any reference to this DX cooling coil by another object will use this name. This cooling coil name must be entered in the AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow object. No other sytem type uses this specific coil.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-1-007}

This alpha field defines the name of the DX cooling coil availabiltiy schedule. Schedule values of 0 denote the DX cooling coil is off. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the coil can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity}\label{field-gross-rated-total-cooling-capacity}

This numeric field defines the gross rated total cooling capacity of the DX cooling coil in watts at a rating point of 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The total cooling capacity should be a gross , i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat NOT accounted for.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Ratio Sensible Heat Ratio}\label{field-gross-ratio-sensible-heat-ratio}

This numeric field defines the gross sensible heat ratio (sensible capacity divided by total cooling capacity) of the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the Rated SHR should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for)

\paragraph{Field: Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-rated-air-flow-rate}

The air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton). The gross rated total cooling capacity and gross rated SHR should be performance information for the unit with at this rated air volume flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-cooling-capacity-ratio-modifier-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the cooling capacity ratio modifier as a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature or indoor wet-bulb and outdoor dry-bulb temperatures. The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. This curve is a linear, quadratic, or cubic curve if the cooling capacity is solely a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet air wet-bulb temperatures). Without specific manufacturers data indicating otherwise, the use of a single independent variable is recommended for this coil type. If, however, the user has reason to believe the cooling capacity is both a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature and outdoor dry-bulb temperature (and has manufacturers data to create the performance curve), a bi-quadratic equation using weighted average indoor wet-bulb temperature and condenser entering air dry-bulb temperature as the independent variables may be used. See the Engineering Reference for more discussion on using this input field.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve Function of Flow Fraction Name}\label{field-cooling-capacity-modifier-curve-function-of-flow-fraction-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a linear, quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Coil Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-coil-air-inlet-node-name}

This alpha field defines the name of the air inlet node entering the DX cooling coil.

\paragraph{Field: Coil Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-coil-air-outlet-node-name}

\paragraph{Field: Name of Water Storage Tank for Condensate Collection}\label{field-name-of-water-storage-tank-for-condensate-collection}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.

\subsection{Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow}\label{coilheatingdxvariablerefrigerantflow}

The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) DX heating coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with performance curves for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. The impacts of defrost operation is modeled based a combination of user inputs and empirical models taken from the air-to-air heat pump algorithms in DOE-2.1E.

The VRF DX heating coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated heating capacity and the rated air volume flow rate. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00008056 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00002684 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity. 

Two performance curves are required. The first performance curve defines the heating capacity as a function of indoor air dry-bulb and outdoor condenser entering air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature. The outdoor air temperature type is specified in the variable refrigerant flow air-to-air heat pump object. The second performance curve defines the change in heating capacity as a function of air flow fraction. Each of these performance curves are further discussed here.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature, specified in Heat Pump)
\end{enumerate}

The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor wet-bulb temperature and indoor air dry-bulb temperature. The curve is normalized to 1 at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 6.11 C outdoor wet-bulb or 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The outdoor air temperature type is specified in the variable refrigerant flow air-to-air heat pump object. Users have the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a tri-quadratic curve with three independent variable. The tri-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the combined total capacity of all indoor units connected to the heat pump condenser and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature) and the combination ratio of the installed system.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction, specified in DX coil)
\end{enumerate}

The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-7-010}

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-2-004}

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX heating coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Heating Capacity}\label{field-gross-rated-heating-capacity-1}

The value entered here must be greater than 0. The gross total heating capacity should not account for the effect of supply air fan heat.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-rated-air-flow-rate-1}

This numeric field defines the volume air flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, across the DX heating coil at rated conditions. The value entered here must be greater than 0. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Capacity Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-heating-capacity-ratio-modifier-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the heating capacity ratio modifier as a function of indoor dry-bulb temperature or indoor dry-bulb and outdoor wet-bulb temperatures. This curve is a linear, quadratic, or cubic curve if the heating capacity is solely a function of indoor dry-bulb temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet air dry-bulb temperatures). Without specific manufacturers data indicating otherwise, the use of a single independent variable is recommended for this coil type. If, however, the user has reason to believe the heating capacity is both a function of indoor dry-bulb temperature and outdoor wet-bulb temperature (and has manufacturers data to create the performance curve), a bi-quadratic equation using weighted average indoor dry-bulb temperature and condenser entering air wet-bulb temperature as the independent variables may be used. See the Engineering Reference for more discussion on using this input field.

Note: The choice of using either outdoor dry-bulb temperature or outdoor wet-bulb temperature as the independent variable in this performance curve is set in the parent object AirConditioner: VariableRefrigerantFlow.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Capacity Ratio Modifier Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-heating-capacity-ratio-modifier-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a linear, quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of heating capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

This is the parasitic electric load associated with the coil operation, such as an inducer fan, etc.. This will be modified by the PLR (or coil runtime fraction if a part-load fraction correlation is provided in the next input field) to reflect the time of operation in a simulation timestep.

\paragraph{Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of fuel consumption rate by the heating coil as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible heating load/nominal capacity of the heating coil). For any simulation timestep, the nominal fuel consumption rate (heating load/burner efficiency) is divided by the part-load fraction (PLF) if a part-load curve has been defined. The part-load curve accounts for efficiency losses due to transient coil operation.

The part-load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the heating coil runs continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 ( 0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the heating coil is defined a PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issues and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional gas heating coil (e.g., residential furnace) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.8 + 0.2(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Field: Parasitic Fuel Load}\label{field-parasitic-gas-load}

This numeric field is the parasitic fuel load associated with the coil's operation (Watts), such as a standing pilot light. The model assumes that this parasitic load is consumed only for the portion of the simulation timestep where the heating coil is not operating.

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}\label{coilcoolingdxsinglespeed}

This DX cooling coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated total cooling capacity, the gross rated SHR, the gross rated COP, and the rated air volume flow rate. The latter 4 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and .00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton).

The rated volumetric air flow to total cooling capacity ratio for 100\% dedicated outdoor air (DOAS) application DX cooling coils should be between 0.00001677 (m3/s)/W (125 cfm/ton) and 0.00003355 (m3/s)/W (250 cfm/ton).

Pumped refrigerant economizer integrated with the single speed DX cooling coil model will use exactly the same model except that performance curves use lookup table to cover the pumped refrigerant economizer and the compressor operating ranges. One or two independent variables may used to represent the performance data.

This model requires 5 curves as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) is a curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.
\item
  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a curve or lookup table with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.
\item
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.
\item
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a curve or lookup table with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.
\item
  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a curve or a lookup table with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible cooling load / steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The curve should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.
\end{enumerate}

The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (see Performance Curves in this document).

The next four input fields are optional and relate to the degradation of latent cooling capacity when the supply air fan operates continuously while the cooling coil/compressor cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. The fan operating mode is determined in the partent object and is considered to either be constant (e.g.~CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled (e.g.~AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool). When scheduled, the schedule value must be greater than 0 to calculate degradation of latent cooling capacity. At times when the parent object s supply air fan operating mode schedule is 0, latent degradation will be ignored. When modeling latent capacity degradation, these next four input fields must all have positive values.

The next input specifies the outdoor air node used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data.

The next input describes the type of outdoor condenser coil used with the DX cooling coil (Air Cooled or Evap Cooled). The following three inputs are required when modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser: evaporative condenser effectiveness, evaporative condenser air volume flow rate, and the power consumed by the evaporative condenser pump. Crankcase heater capacity and cutout temperature are entered in the next two input fields. These two fields for this object define the name of the water storage tank for supply and condensate collection. See section DX Cooling Coil Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.

The last two input fields following the Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name are the Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR) modifier cruve names for temperature and flow fraction. These two input fields are optional and used only when a user intends to override SHR calculated using the apparatus dew point (ADP) and bypass factor (BF) method. See section SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.

The input power includes electric power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.

For DOAS applications the rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00001677 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00003355 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (125 to 250 cfm/ton).

\paragraph{Field: Rated Evaporator Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate}\label{field-rated-evaporator-fan-power-per-volume-flow-rate}

This field is the electric power for the evaporator (cooling coil) fan per air volume flow rate through the coil at the rated conditions in W/(m\(^{3}\)/s). The default value is 773.3 W/(m\(^{3}\)/s) (365 W/1000 cfm) if this field is left blank. If a value is entered, it must be \textgreater{} = 0.0 and \textless{} = 1250 W/(m\(^{3}\)/s). This value is only used to calculate Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER), Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER), Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) and the Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity which will be outputs in the EnergyPlus eio file (ref. EnergyPlus Engineering Reference, Single Speed DX Cooling Coil, Standard Ratings). This value is not used for modeling the evaporator (cooling coil) fan during simulations; instead, it is used for calculating SEER, EER, IEER and Standard Rating Cooling Capacity to assist the user in verifying their inputs for modeling this type of equipment.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.

\paragraph{Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

The name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

The name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.

\paragraph{Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

The name of a performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.

\paragraph{Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name-2}

This alpha field defines the name of a performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation}\label{field-minimum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-compressor-operation}

Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}), and this field as well as the next three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

\paragraph{Field: Ratio of Initial Moisture Evaporation Rate and Steady State Latent Capacity}\label{field-ratio-of-initial-moisture-evaporation-rate-and-steady-state-latent-capacity}

Ratio of the initial moisture evaporation rate from the cooling coil (when the compressor first turns off, in Watts) and the coil's steady-state latent capacity (Watts) at rated airflow and temperature conditions. Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}); and this field, the previous field and the next two fields must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Cycling Rate}\label{field-maximum-cycling-rate}

The maximum on-off cycling rate for the compressor (cycles per hour), which occurs at 50\% run time fraction. Suggested value is 3; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}); and this field, the previous two fields and the next field must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

\paragraph{Field: Latent Capacity Time Constant}\label{field-latent-capacity-time-constant}

Time constant (in seconds) for the cooling coil's latent capacity to reach steady state after startup. Suggested value is 45: supply air fan operating mode must be continuous. That is, the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects (e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool), and this field as well as the previous three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-condenser-air-inlet-node-name}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Type}\label{field-condenser-type}

The type of condenser used by the DX cooling coil. Valid choices for this input field are \textbf{AirCooled} or \textbf{EvaporativelyCooled}. The default for this field is \textbf{AirCooled}.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness}

The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:

\begin{equation}
Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)
\end{equation}

where

\emph{T\(_{cond\\ inlet}\)} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)

\emph{T\(_{wb,o}\)} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

\emph{T\(_{db,o}\)} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.

If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-air-flow-rate}

The air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000144 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity {[}850 cfm/ton{]}). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Pump Rated Power Consumption}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-pump-rated-power-consumption}

The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt {[}15 W/ton{]} of rated total cooling capacity). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

\paragraph{Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity}\label{field-crankcase-heater-capacity}

This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. If this cooling coil is used as part of an air-to-air heat pump (Ref. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir or PackageTerminal: HeatPump:AirToAir), the crankcase heater defined for this DX cooling coil is ignored and the crankcase heater power defined for the DX heating coil (Ref. Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed) is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running for either heating or cooling. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0, and the default value is 0. To simulate a DX cooling coil without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor s crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0 °C, and the default value is 10 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-000}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling of its condenser. If blank or omitted, then the unit will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the unit will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the unit will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the condenser needs, then the unit will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).

\paragraph{Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-condensate-collection-water-storage-tank-name-2}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-000}

This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil s electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the DX coil is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-000}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the DX coil is off.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name-000}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the DX coil is off.

The name of a biquadratic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of DX cooling coil entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of flow fraction) to give the SHR at the specific coil entering air temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating.

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed}\label{coilcoolingdxtwospeed}

This component models a two-speed (or variable speed) DX compressor and fan. The method is based on the model used for the cycling, single speed DX unit. The single speed unit is described by single full load capacity, SHR, COP, and air flow rate at rated conditions. Off rated full load performance is obtained by the use of 4 modifier curves. At partial load the unit cycles on/off and the cycling losses are described by a part load fraction curve.

The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at two states: high speed compressor, high speed fan; and low speed compressor, low speed fan. When the unit load is above the high speed capacity, the unit runs with high speed compressor and fan. When the load on the unit is below the high speed capacity but above the low speed capacity, the unit will run with performance intermediate between high speed and low speed. When the load is less than the low speed capacity, the unit will cycle on/off just like the single speed unit.

The multispeed unit model requires 2 full sets of performance data. There must be a high and low speed capacity, SHR, COP, and evaporator air flow rate; as well as high and low speed performance curves total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) and energy input ratio modifier curve (function of temperature).

The multispeed DX component should be used for all cases in which a DX VAV system is being simulated. Obviously this model in which performance is obtained by interpolating between 2 specified states - is an oversimplification of how real multi-speed and variable speed DX cooling units are controlled. But detailed descriptions of how actual units perform and are controlled are not available. This model should give a good average prediction of multispeed and variable speed DX cooling unit performance. The last four input fields following the Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name are the Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR) modifier cruve names for temperature and flow fraction for high and low speed DX cooling coils. These four input fields are optional and used only when a user intends to override SHR calculated using the apparatus dew point (ADP) and bypass factor (BF) method. See section SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details..

A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

Capacity should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Gross Rated Sensible Heat Ratio}\label{field-high-speed-gross-rated-sensible-heat-ratio}

The sensible heat ratio (gross sensible capacity divided by gross total cooling capacity) of the DX cooling coil for high speed compressor and high speed fan at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb\protect\hyperlink{ux5fftn2}{{[}2{]}}, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the Rated SHR should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Gross Rated Cooling COP}\label{field-high-speed-gross-rated-cooling-cop}

The coefficient of performance is the ratio of the gross total cooling capacity in watts to electrical power input in watts) of the DX cooling coil unit for high speed compressor and high speed fan at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). The input power includes electric power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-high-speed-rated-air-flow-rate}

The high speed air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity. For DOAS applications the rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00001677 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00003355 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (125 to 250 cfm/ton). The gross rated total cooling capacity, gross rated SHR and gross rated COP should be performance information for the unit with air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb, and the rated air volume flow rate defined here.

\paragraph{Field: Unit Internal Static Air Pressure}\label{field-unit-internal-static-air-pressure}

If this coil is used with a Fan:VariableVolume to model a packaged variable-air-volume unit, then ratings for standard rated net capacity, EER, and IEER will be calculated per ANSI/AHRI Standard 340/360-2007 with Addenda 1 and 2. This field is to specify the internal static air pressure, in units of Pascals, associated with the unit s supply air flow for rating purposes. This field does not affect the performance during operation. This field is optional. If this field is used, then the internal static air pressure is used with the associated fan characteristics when calculating standard rated net capacity, EER, and IEER. If this field is not used, then the standard ratings are still performed but use a default for specific fan power of 773.3 (W/(m\(^{3}\)/s)). The air pressure drop/rise input here should be internal in the sense that it is for the entire package of unitary equipment as it would be tested in a laboratory (including other non-cooling sections inside the package for filters, dampers, and.or heating coils) but none of the external pressure drop for distributing supply air throughout the building. This is different from the input field called Pressure Rise in the fan object which includes both the external static pressure and the internal static pressure. The results of standard rating calculations are reported to the EIO file and to predefined output tables called DX Cooling Coils and VAV DX Cooling Standard Rating Details.

The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is used for performance at the high speed compressor, high speed fan operating point.

\paragraph{Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name-1}

The name of a quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of gross total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is applied only at the high speed compressor, high speed fan operating point. There is no corresponding curve for the low speed operating point.

\paragraph{Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-1}

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is used for performance at the high speed compressor, high speed fan operating point.

\paragraph{Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name-1}

The name of a quadratic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This curve is applied only at the high speed compressor, high speed fan operating point. There is no corresponding curve for the low speed operating point.

\paragraph{Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name-3}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

The input power includes power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.

\paragraph{Field: Low Speed Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-low-speed-rated-air-flow-rate}

The low speed volume air flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of the gross rated total cooling capacity. For DOAS applications the rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00001677 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00003355 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (125 to 250 cfm/ton). The gross rated total cooling capacity, gross rated SHR and gross rated COP should be performance information for the unit with air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb, and the rated air volume flow rate defined here.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is used for performance at the low speed compressor, low speed fan operating point.

\paragraph{Field: Low Speed Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-low-speed-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the wetbulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil and the drybulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser (wetbulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is used for performance at the low speed compressor, low speed fan operating point.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-condenser-air-inlet-node-name-1}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Type}\label{field-condenser-type-1}

This numeric field defines the minimum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature where the cooling coil compressor turns off. If this input field is left blank, the value defaults to that specified in the IDD (e.g., -25 °C). If this field is not included in the input, the default value is -25 °C.

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness}\label{field-high-speed-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness}

The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser at high compressor/fan speed, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:

Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectivenes{s_{HighSpeed}}} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)
\end{equation}

where

\emph{T\(_{cond\\ inlet}\)} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)

\emph{T\(_{wb,o}\)} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

\emph{T\(_{db,o}\)} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.

If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate}\label{field-high-speed-evaporative-condenser-air-flow-rate}

The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000144 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of rated high-speed total cooling capacity {[}850 cfm/ton{]}). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

\paragraph{Field: High Speed Evaporative Condenser Pump Rated Power Consumption}\label{field-high-speed-evaporative-condenser-pump-rated-power-consumption}

The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts at high compressor/fan speed. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt {[}15 W/ton{]} of rated high-speed total cooling capacity). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

\paragraph{Field: Low Speed Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness}\label{field-low-speed-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness}

The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser at low compressor/fan speed, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:

\begin{equation}
Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectivenes{s_{LowSpeed}}} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)
\end{equation}

where

\emph{T\(_{cond\\ inlet}\)} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)

\emph{T\(_{wb,o}\)} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

\emph{T\(_{db,o}\)} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, low speed (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, low speed (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts at low compressor/fan speed. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.001422 W per watt {[}5 W/ton{]} of rated high-speed total capacity). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-1-000}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the coil will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).

\paragraph{Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-condensate-collection-water-storage-tank-name-3}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-1-000}

This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil s electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the DX coil is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the DX coil is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name-1-000}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the DX coil is off.

\paragraph{Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-sensible-heat-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-1}

The name of a biquadratic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of DX cooling coil entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of flow fraction) to give the SHR at the specific coil entering air temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rated condition. This input field is optional.

The name of a quadratic or cubic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the SHR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This input field is optional.

\paragraph{Field: Low Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-low-sensible-heat-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

The name of a biquadratic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of DX cooling coil entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of flow fraction) to give the SHR at the specific coil entering air temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rated condition. This input field is optional.

\paragraph{Field: Low Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-low-sensible-heat-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

The name of a quadratic or cubic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the SHR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This input field is optional.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name for Condenser Placement}\label{field-zone-name-for-condenser-placement-1}

This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (condenser) of DX system or a heat pump is to be placed. This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to reject the condenser heat into a zone. The heat rejected is modeled as sensible internal gain of a secondary zone.

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}\label{coilcoolingdxtwostagewithhumiditycontrolmode}

The multimode DX coil is functionally equivalent to Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed but with multiple performance modes. It is capable of modeling two-stage DX units and units with an enhanced dehumidification mode such as coil bypass or subcool reheat. This object contains one-time specifications for the DX unit such as node names and crankcase heater specifications. It references one or more CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling objects which define the performance for each mode of operation. It can have up to 4 performance modes to accommodate a 2-stage 2-mode unit.

The multimode DX coil can be used only as a component of CoilSystem:Cooling:DX or AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass (parent object). These parent objects pass a load and dehumidification mode to this coil. If the coil has 2 capacity stages, the multimode coil model determines the stage sequencing.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-15-004}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-14-002}

A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a DX cooling coil. Any reference to this DX coil by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-8-001}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX cooling coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during a given time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name-10}

The name of the HVAC system node from which the DX cooling coil draws its inlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-air-outlet-node-name-10}

The name of the HVAC system node to which the DX cooling coil sends its outlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity}\label{field-crankcase-heater-capacity-1}

This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. If this cooling coil is used as part of an air-to-air heat pump (Ref. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass), the crankcase heater defined for this DX cooling coil is ignored and the crankcase heater power defined for the DX heating coil (Ref. Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed) is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running for either heating or cooling. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0, and the default value is 0. To simulate a DX cooling coil without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation-1}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor s crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0 °C, and the default value is 10 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Capacity Stages}\label{field-number-of-capacity-stages}

This integer field defines the number of capacity stages. The value for this input field must be either 1 or 2, and the default value is 1. Larger DX units often have two capacity stages, which are often two completely independent compressor/coil circuits with the evaporator coils arranged in parallel in the supply air stream. 2-stage operation affects cycling losses and latent degradation due to re-evaporation of moisture with continuous fan operation.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Enhanced Dehumidification Modes}\label{field-number-of-enhanced-dehumidification-modes}

This integer field defines the number of enhanced dehumidification modes available. The value for this input field must be 0 or 1, and the default value is 0. If the DX unit can switch operating modes to increase dehumidification based on a humidistat signal, then set this to 1. This field just specified the availability of enhanced dehumidification. Actual control of the operating mode is handled by the coil's parent component.

\paragraph{Field: Normal Mode Stage 1 Coil Performance Object Type}\label{field-normal-mode-stage-1-coil-performance-object-type}

\paragraph{Field: Normal Mode Stage 1 Coil Performance Object Name}\label{field-normal-mode-stage-1-coil-performance-object-name}

This pair of fields specifies the object type and name for the coil performance object which specifies the DX coil performance for stage 1 operation without enhanced dehumidification (normal mode). The only valid performance object type is CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling.

\paragraph{Field: Normal Mode Stage 1+2 Coil Performance Object Type}\label{field-normal-mode-stage-12-coil-performance-object-type}

\paragraph{Field: Normal Mode Stage 1+2 Coil Performance Object Name}\label{field-normal-mode-stage-12-coil-performance-object-name}

This pair of fields specifies the object type and name for the coil performance object which specifies the DX coil performance for stage 1+2 operation (both stages active) without enhanced dehumidification (normal mode). The only valid performance object type is CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling.

\paragraph{Field: Dehumidification Mode 1 Stage 1 Coil Performance Object Type}\label{field-dehumidification-mode-1-stage-1-coil-performance-object-type}

\paragraph{Field: Dehumidification Mode 1 Stage 1 Coil Performance Object Name}\label{field-dehumidification-mode-1-stage-1-coil-performance-object-name}

This pair of fields specifies the object type and name for the coil performance object which specifies the DX coil performance for stage 1 operation with enhanced dehumidification active. The only valid performance object type is CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling.

\paragraph{Field: Dehumidification Mode 1 Stage 1+2 Coil Performance Object Type}\label{field-dehumidification-mode-1-stage-12-coil-performance-object-type}

\paragraph{Field: Dehumidification Mode 1 Stage 1+2 Coil Performance Object Name}\label{field-dehumidification-mode-1-stage-12-coil-performance-object-name}

This pair of fields specifies the object type and name for the coil performance object which specifies the DX coil performance for stage 1+2 operation (both stages active) with enhanced dehumidification active. The only valid performance object type is CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling.

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-2-000}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the coil will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).

\paragraph{Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-condensate-collection-water-storage-tank-name-4}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation}\label{field-minimum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-compressor-operation}

This numeric field defines the minimum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature where the cooling coil compressor turns off. If this input field is left blank, the value defaults to that specified in the IDD (e.g., -25 °C). If this field is not included in the input, the default value is -25 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-2-000}

This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil s electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the DX coil is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-2-000}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the DX coil is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name-2-000}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the DX coil is off.

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed}\label{coilcoolingdxmultispeed}

This component models a DX cooling unit with multiple discrete levels of cooling capacity. Depending on input choices, the user can model a single compressor with multiple operating speeds, or a unit with a single cooling coil fed by multiple compressors (e.g., row split or intertwined coil circuiting). Currently, this cooling coil can only be referenced by a AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:Multispeed object. Refer to Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode if the user wishes to model a cooling coil with discrete levels of cooling and the possibility of air bypass during low speed operation (e.g.~face-split coil circuiting), or if cooling coil operation based on dehumidification requirements is desired.

The multispeed DX cooling coil can have from two to four operating speeds. When the coil operates at Speed 1 (the lowest speed), its performance is very similar to the single speed DX coil where the impacts of part-load ratio and latent capacity degradation can be included. When the coil operates at higher speeds (above Speed 1), the linear approximation methodology is applied. The coil outputs at two consecutive speeds are linearly interpolated to meet the required cooling capacity during an HVAC system timestep. When the coil performs above the lowest speed, the user can chose if they want to include part-load ratio and latent capacity degradation impacts at the higher speeds.

The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at different operating speeds. Each speed has its own set of input specifications: full load capacity, SHR, COP and air flow rate at rated conditions, along with modifier curves to determine performance when actual operating conditions are different from the rated conditions.

The coil operates to meet the sensible capacity being requested. When this requested capacity is above the sensible capacity of the highest operating speed, the coil runs continuously at the highest speed. When the requested capacity is between the sensible capacities of two consecutive speeds, the unit will operate a portion of the time at each speed to meet the request. When the requested capacity is less than the low speed (Speed 1) capacity, the unit will cycle on/off as needed.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-16-003}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-15-002}

A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a multispeed DX cooling coil. Any reference to this DX coil by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-9-000}

The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX cooling coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name-11}

The name of the HVAC system node from which the DX cooling coil draws its inlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-air-outlet-node-name-11}

The name of the HVAC system node to which the DX cooling coil sends its outlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-condenser-air-inlet-node-name-2}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Type}\label{field-condenser-type-2}

The type of condenser used by the multispeed DX cooling coil. Valid choices for this input field are AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. The default for this field is AirCooled.

\paragraph{Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-supply-water-storage-tank-name-3-000}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the coil will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).

\paragraph{Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-condensate-collection-water-storage-tank-name-5}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.

\paragraph{Field: Apply Part Load Fraction to Speeds Greater than 1}\label{field-apply-part-load-fraction-to-speeds-greater-than-1}

This field determines whether part-load impacts on coil energy use are applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify a part-load fraction correlation for each speed to account for compressor start up losses (cycle on/off). For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, the part load losses may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify NO for this input field to neglect part-load impacts on energy use at higher operating speeds. If part-load impacts on coil energy use are thought to be significant (e.g., interwined cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify YES and the part-load fraction correlations specified for speeds 2 through 4 will be applied as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect part-load impacts when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off (i.e., the part-load fraction correlation for speed 1 is always applied).

\paragraph{Field: Apply Latent Degradation to Speeds Greater than 1}\label{field-apply-latent-degradation-to-speeds-greater-than-1}

This field determines whether latent capacity degradation is applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify latent capacity degradation at each speed.

The latent capacity degradation model only applies when the ContinuousFanWithCyclingCompressor supply air fan operating mode is specified, to account for moisture evaporation from the wet cooling coil when the compressor cycles off but the supply air fan continues to operate. For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, latent capacity degradation may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify NO for this input field to neglect latent capacity degradation impacts at higher operating speeds. If latent capacity degradation is thought to be significant (e.g., interwined or row-split cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify YES and the latent capacity degradation model will be applied for speeds 2 through 4 as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect latent capacity degradation between speed 1 and off.

\paragraph{Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity}\label{field-crankcase-heater-capacity-2}

This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0. To simulate a unit without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation-2}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor s crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0 °C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 10 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation}\label{field-minimum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-compressor-operation}

This numeric field defines the minimum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature where the cooling coil compressor turns off. If this input field is left blank, the value defaults to that specified in the IDD (e.g., -25 °C).

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Capacity}\label{field-basin-heater-capacity-3-000}

This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil s electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the DX coil is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature-3-000}

This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the DX coil is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name}\label{field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name-3-000}

This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the DX coil is off.

\paragraph{Field: Fuel Type}\label{field-fuel-type-000}

This alpha field determines the type of fuel that this cooling coil uses. This field has seven choices: Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, OtherFuel1 and OtherFuel2. This is a required field with no default.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Speeds}\label{field-number-of-speeds}

This field specifies the number of sets of data being entered for rated specifications, performance curves, evaporative condenser data, latent degradation data, and waste heat specifications for each cooling speed. The rated specifications consist of gross rated capacity, gross rated SHR, gross rated COP, and rated air flow rate. The performance curves consist of a total capacity modifier curve as a function of temperature, total capacity modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of temperature, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, and part load fraction correlation as a function of part load ratio. The evaporative condenser data consists of effectiveness, condenser air volume flow rate, and rated pump power consumption. The latent degradation data consists of nominal time for condensate removal to begin, ratio of initial moisture evaporation rate and steady-state latent capacity, maximum On/Off cycling rate, and latent capacity time constant. The latent degradation data are only applied if the supply air fan operation mode is specified as ContinuousFanWithCyclingCompressor. The waste heat specifications include the fraction of energy input to the cooling coil at the fully loaded and rated conditions, and a temperature modifier. The minimum number of speeds for cooling is 2 and the maximum number is 4. The number of speeds should be the same as the number of speeds for cooling defined in its parent object (AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed). The first set of performance inputs is for Speed 1 and should be for low speed, and the last set of performance inputs should be for high speed. For example, if only three cooling speeds are defined, the first set should be for low speed (Speed 1), the second set should be for medium speed (Speed 2), and the third set should be for high speed (Speed 3). In this example, any performance inputs for Speed 4 would be neglected (since this input field specifies that the coil only has three cooling speeds).

\paragraph{Field Group: Rated Specification, Performance Curves, Latent Capacity Degradation Inputs, and Evaporative Cooled Condenser Data}\label{field-group-rated-specification-performance-curves-latent-capacity-degradation-inputs-and-evaporative-cooled-condenser-data}

The performance for each cooling speed must be specified as shown below. All inputs for Speed 1 are required first, followed by the inputs for Speed 2, Speed 3 and Speed 4.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity}\label{field-speed-x-gross-rated-total-cooling-capacity}

The total, full load gross cooling capacity (sensible plus latent) in watts of the DX coil unit for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb\protect\hyperlink{ux5fftn3}{{[}3{]}}, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field Rated Air Flow Rate, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} below). Capacity should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Gross Rated Sensible Heat Ratio}\label{field-speed-x-gross-rated-sensible-heat-ratio}

The sensible heat ratio (SHR = gross sensible capacity divided by gross total cooling capacity) of the DX cooling coil for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field Rated Air Flow Rate, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} below). Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the Rated SHR should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Gross Rated Cooling COP}\label{field-speed-x-gross-rated-cooling-cop}

The coefficient of performance is the ratio of the gross total cooling capacity in watts to electrical power input in watts) of the DX cooling coil unit for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field Rated Air Flow Rate, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} below). The input power includes power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-speed-x-rated-air-flow-rate}

The volumetric air flow rate for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}, in m\(^{3}\) per second, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The rated air volume flow rate for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} should be between 0.00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of the gross rated total cooling capacity for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}. The gross rated total cooling capacity, gross rated SHR and gross rated COP for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} should be performance information for the unit with air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb, and the rated air volume flow rate defined here.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}X\textgreater{} Rated Evaporator Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate}\label{field-speed-x-rated-evaporator-fan-power-per-volume-flow-rate}

This field is the electric power for the evaporator (cooling coil) fan per air volume flow rate through the coil at the rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} in W/(m3/s). The default value is 773.3 W/(m3/s) (365 W/1000 cfm) if this field is left blank. If a value is entered, it must be \textgreater{} = 0.0 and \textless{} = 1250 W/(m3/s). This value is only used to calculate Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER), and the Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity which will be outputs in the EnergyPlus eio file (ref. EnergyPlus Engineering Reference, Multi-Speed DX Cooling Coil, Standard Ratings). This value is not used for modeling the evaporator (cooling coil) fan during simulations; instead, it is used for calculating SEER and Standard Rating Cooling Capacity to assist the user in verifying their inputs for modeling this type of equipment.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Total Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

The name of a quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} as a function of the wetbulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil and the drybulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser (wetbulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (inverse of rated COP for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}) to give the EIR for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

The name of a quadratic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF > = 0.7     and     PLF > = PLR
\end{lstlisting}

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX cooling coil (Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Nominal Time for Condensate Removal to Begin}\label{field-speed-x-nominal-time-for-condensate-removal-to-begin}

For Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}, the nominal time (in seconds) after startup for condensate to begin leaving the coil's condensate drain line at the coil's rated airflow and temperature conditions, starting with a dry coil. Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}), and this field as well as the next three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Ratio of Initial Moisture Evaporation Rate and Steady State Latent Capacity}\label{field-speed-x-ratio-of-initial-moisture-evaporation-rate-and-steady-state-latent-capacity}

For Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}, the ratio of the initial moisture evaporation rate from the cooling coil (when the compressor first turns off, in Watts) and the coil's steady-state latent capacity (Watts) for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} at rated airflow and temperature conditions. Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}); and this field, the previous field and the next two fields must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Maximum Cycling Rate}\label{field-speed-x-maximum-cycling-rate}

For Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}, the maximum on-off cycling rate for the compressor (cycles per hour), which occurs at 50\% run time fraction. Suggested value is 3; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}); and this field, the previous two fields and the next field must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Latent Capacity Time Constant}\label{field-speed-x-latent-capacity-time-constant}

For Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}, the time constant (in seconds) for the cooling coil's latent capacity to reach steady state after startup. Suggested value is 45; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}), and this field as well as the previous three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Rated Waste Heat Fraction of Power Input}\label{field-speed-x-rated-waste-heat-fraction-of-power-input}

The fraction of energy input to the cooling coil that is available as recoverable waste heat at full load and rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Waste Heat Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-waste-heat-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the waste heat recovery as a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature and the entering coil dry-bulb temperature at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated waste heat fraction at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. When the fuel type is electricity, this field can remain blank since it is ignored by the program in this instance. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed does not require waste heat calculations, this field is ignored. If the field is blank, a warning will be issued and simulation continues. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed requires waste heat calculations, if this field is left blank, the program assumes a constant value of 1 to make simulation continue and a warning will be issued.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness}\label{field-speed-x-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness}

The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:

\begin{equation}
Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectivenes{s_{Speed1}}} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)
\end{equation}

where

\emph{T\(_{cond\\ inlet}\)} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)

\emph{T\(_{wb,o}\)} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

\emph{T\(_{db,o}\)} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.

If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate}\label{field-speed-x-evaporative-condenser-air-flow-rate}

The air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, entering the evaporative condenser at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}. This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000114 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} {[}850 cfm/ton{]}). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Rated Evaporative Condenser Pump Power Consumption}\label{field-speed-x-rated-evaporative-condenser-pump-power-consumption}

The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt {[}15 W/ton{]} of rated total capacity for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name for Condenser Placement}\label{field-zone-name-for-condenser-placement-2}

This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (condenser) of DX system or a heat pump is to be placed. This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to reject the condenser heat into a zone. The heat rejected is modeled as sensible internal gain of a secondary zone.

Following is an example input for this multispeed DX cooling coil.

This is the runtime fraction of the stage 2 DX coil compressor and condenser fan(s) for the timestep being reported. Applicable only for COIL Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode when 2 capacity stages are specified. For 2-stage systems, Cooling Coil Runtime Fraction is the stage 1 runtime fraction. These runtime fractions overlap, because stage 2 will not run unless stage 1 is already running. For example, a system where stage 1 is 60\% of total capacity is passed a load of 70\%. The Cooling Coil Runtime Fraction (stage 1) will be 1.0, and the Cooling Coil Stage 2 Runtime Fraction will be 0.25 {[}(70\%-60\%)/(100\%-60\%){]}.

This is the dehumidification mode for the timestep being reported. Applicable only for Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode when enhanced dehumidification mode is available. A value of 0 indicates normal mode (extra dehumidification not active). A value of 1 indicates dehumidification mode 1 is active. Note that this is an averaged variable, so fractional values are likely to be reported for reporting frequencies longer than ``detailed''.

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}\label{coilcoolingdxvariablespeed}

The Variable-Speed DX Cooling Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the cooling coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from a Reference Unit data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. On the other hand, the model uses the bypass factor approach to calculate sensible heat transfer rate, similar to the one used in the single-speed DX coil. The number of speed levels can range from 1 to 10. The cooling coil has two indoor air side connections, and one optional condenser air node connection. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated total cooling capacity, and rated volumetric air rate are sized. The rated capacity and rated volumetric flow rate represent the real situation in the air loop, and are used to determine and flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~of AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool, ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner, AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir and ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e.~the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rate at each individual speed and at the rated conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the single-speed DX coil. However, the performance values, e.g.~capacities, COPs, SHRs and flow rates at individual speed levels, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with Reference Unit means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities, COPs and SHRs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 26.67 ˚C (80 ˚F), wet bulb temperature of 19.44 ˚C (67 ˚F), and the condenser entering air temperature of 35 ˚C (95 ˚F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields.

\end{equation}

And then, this scaling factor is used to determine capacities at rated conditions for other speed levels, as below,

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \rm{Gross RatedCapacity} @ \rm{SpeedLevel} \left( {\rm{x}} \right) = \\
    \quad \quad \quad \rm{CapacityScaleFactor} \times \\

  \end{array}
\end{equation}

  \end{array}
\end{equation}

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).

If a tank is specified, the unit will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the condenser needs, then the unit will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).

\paragraph{Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name}\label{field-condensate-collection-water-storage-tank-name-6}

This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.

\subsection{CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling}\label{coilperformancedxcooling}

This coil performance object is used to specify DX coil performance for one mode of operation for a Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode. A single Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode object will reference one to four CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling objects depending on the number of available stages and dehumidification modes as specified in the two stage DX object. For example, a standard 2-stage DX system will use two of these performance objects, one to defined the capacity and performance for stage 1 operation, and a second one for stage 1+2 (both stages active) operation. In nearly all cases, the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate will be the same for all performance objects associated with a given multimode DX coil. If bypass is specified, the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate includes both the bypassed flow and the flow through the active coil.

This DX coil model is identical to Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed with addition of bypass and multi-stage capabilities. This DX cooling coil model and input are quite different from that for the heating and cooling water coils. The simple water coils use an NTU-effectiveness heat exchanger model. The single speed DX coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with curve fits for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part-load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. Sensible/latent capacity splits are determined by the rated sensible heat ratio (SHR) and the apparatus dewpoint/bypass factor (ADP/BF) approach. This approach is analogous to the NTU-effectiveness calculations used for sensible-only heat exchanger calculations, extended to a cooling and dehumidifying coil.

An alternative to ADP/BF method for sensible/latent capacity split is to use SHR modifier curves for temperature and flow fraction. These two optional input fields are used only when a user specified SHR calculation method desired over the (ADP/BF) method. Sensible heat ratio calculated using these two SHR modifier curves override the value calculated by ADP/BF method. See section SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.

The DX cooling coil input requires the gross rated total cooling capacity, the gross rated SHR, the gross rated COP, the rated air volume flow rate, and the fraction of air flow which is bypassed around the coil. The first 4 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb). The rated air volume flow rate (less any bypassed fraction) should be between .00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and .00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton). The rated volumetric air flow to gross total cooling capacity ratio for 100\% dedicated outdoor air (DOAS) application DX cooling coils should be between 0.00001677 (m3/s)/W (125 cfm/ton) and 0.00003355 (m3/s)/W (250 cfm/ton).

This model requires 5 curves as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) is a biquadratic curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).
\item
  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
\item
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a biquadratic curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).
\item
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
\item
  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible cooling load / steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The curve should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).
\end{enumerate}

The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (see Performance Curves in this document).

The next four input fields are optional and relate to the degradation of latent cooling capacity when the supply air fan operates continuously while the cooling coil/compressor cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. The fan operating mode is either considered to be constant (e.g.~CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in the parent object (e.g.~AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool). When scheduled, the schedule value must be greater than 0 to calculate degradation of latent cooling capacity. At times when the parent object s supply air fan operating mode schedule is 0, latent degradation will be ignored. When used, these next four input fields must all have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

The next input specifies the outdoor air node used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. This field may also be left blank, if this is the case then the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data.

The next input describes the type of outdoor condenser coil used with the DX cooling coil (Air Cooled or Evap Cooled). The following three inputs are required when modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser: evaporative condenser effectiveness, evaporative condenser air volume flow rate, and the power consumed by the evaporative condenser pump. See section DX Cooling Coil Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-18-001}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-17-001}

This alpha field is a unique user-assigned name for an instance of DX cooling coil performance. Any reference to this DX coil performance object by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity}\label{field-gross-rated-total-cooling-capacity-2}

The total, full load gross cooling capacity (sensible plus latent) in watts of the DX coil unit at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb\protect\hyperlink{ux5fftn4}{{[}4{]}}, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). Capacity should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Sensible Heat Ratio}\label{field-gross-rated-sensible-heat-ratio-1}

The sensible heat ratio (SHR = gross sensible capacity divided by gross total cooling capacity) of the DX cooling coil at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the Rated SHR should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Cooling COP}\label{field-gross-rated-cooling-cop-1}

The coefficient of performance is the ratio of the gross total cooling capacity in watts to electrical power input in watts) of the DX cooling coil unit at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/ 23.9 °C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). The input power includes electric power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-rated-air-flow-rate-3}

The air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The gross rated total cooling capacity, gross rated SHR and gross rated COP should be performance information for the unit with air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 °C drybulb/19.4 °C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 °C drybulb/23.9 °C wetbulb, and the rated air volume flow rate defined here.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction of Air Flow Bypassed Around Coil}\label{field-fraction-of-air-flow-bypassed-around-coil}

This numeric field specifies the fraction of the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate which bypasses the active cooling coil for this performance mode. The remaining portion of the flow should be between 0.00004027 m3/s and .00006041 m3/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton) for this performance mode. For DOAS applications the remaining portion of rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00001677 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00003355 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (125 to 250 cfm/ton). This is used to model face-split coils on multi-stage units or bypass dampers. If total flow rate varies during simulation, the same fraction is bypassed. This input may range from 0.0 to \textless{}1.0. The default is 0.0. For a multi-stage face-split coil in which stage 1 is 60\% of total capacity, this field would be set to 0.4 for the Stage 1 performance and set to 0.0 for the Stage 1+2 performance. For a DX system which activates a bypass damper for improved dehumidification, this field would be set to 0.0 for normal mode performance and set to something greater than zero for enhanced dehumidification mode performance.

\paragraph{Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-temperature-curve-name-2}

The name of a \textbf{biquadratic} performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the total gross cooling capacity as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name-2}

The name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-2}

The name of a \textbf{biquadratic} performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name-2}

The name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name-5}

This alpha field defines the name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Field: Nominal Time for Condensate Removal to Begin}\label{field-nominal-time-for-condensate-removal-to-begin-2}

The nominal time (in seconds) after startup for condensate to begin leaving the coil's condensate drain line at the coil's rated airflow and temperature conditions, starting with a dry coil. Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}), and this field as well as the next three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

\paragraph{Field: Ratio of Initial Moisture Evaporation Rate and Steady State Latent Capacity}\label{field-ratio-of-initial-moisture-evaporation-rate-and-steady-state-latent-capacity-2}

Ratio of the initial moisture evaporation rate from the cooling coil (when the compressor first turns off, in Watts) and the coil's steady-state latent capacity (Watts) at rated airflow and temperature conditions. Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}); and this field, the previous field and the next two fields must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Cycling Rate}\label{field-maximum-cycling-rate-1}

The maximum on-off cycling rate for the compressor (cycles per hour), which occurs at 50\% run time fraction. Suggested value is 3; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}); and this field, the previous two fields and the next field must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

\paragraph{Field: Latent Capacity Time Constant}\label{field-latent-capacity-time-constant-1}

Time constant (in seconds) for the cooling coil's latent capacity to reach steady state after startup. Suggested value is 45; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects {[}e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool{]}), and this field as well as the previous three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-condenser-air-inlet-node-name-4}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Condenser Type}\label{field-condenser-type-4}

The type of condenser used by the DX cooling coil. Valid choices for this input field are \textbf{AirCooled} or \textbf{EvaporativelyCooled}. The default for this field is \textbf{AirCooled}.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness-1}

The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:

\begin{equation}
Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)
\end{equation}

where

\emph{T\(_{cond\\ inlet}\)} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)

\emph{T\(_{wb,o}\)} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

\emph{T\(_{db,o}\)} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)

The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.

If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-air-flow-rate-1}

The air volume flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000144 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity {[}850 cfm/ton{]}). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporative Condenser Pump Rated Power Consumption}\label{field-evaporative-condenser-pump-rated-power-consumption-2}

The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt {[}15 W/ton{]} of rated total cooling capacity). This field is not used when Condenser Type = AirCooled.

\paragraph{Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-sensible-heat-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-2}

The name of a biquadratic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of DX cooling coil entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of flow fraction) to give the SHR at the specific coil entering air temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rated condition. This input field is optional.

\paragraph{Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-sensible-heat-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name-2}

The name of a quadratic or cubic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the SHR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This input field is optional.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-14-001}

The CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling object does not have specific output variables. To request reports, use the parent object Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode output variable options (ref. DX Cooling Coil Outputs). When requesting specific output variables by name, use the name of the parent object as the Key Value for Output:Variable reporting objects (ref. Output:Variable object). The name of the CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling object cannot be used as a Key Value in the Output:Variable object.

\subsection{Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed}\label{coilheatingdxsinglespeed}

The single speed heating DX coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with curve fits for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. The impacts of various defrost strategies (reverse cycle, resistive, timed or on-demand) are modeled based on a combination of user inputs and empirical models taken from the air-to-air heat pump algorithms in DOE-2.1E.

The single speed heating DX coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated heating capacity, the gross rated COP and the rated air volume flow rate. The latter 3 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 C). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and .00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity.

Up to 6 curves are required depending on the defrost strategy selected.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).
\item
  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
\item
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).
\item
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
\item
  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible heating load / steady-state heating capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
\item
  The defrost energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: the heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the coil is operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is specified.
\end{enumerate}

The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (ref. Performance Curves).

The next input item for the coil is the supply air fan operation mode. Either the supply air fan runs continuously while the DX coil cycles on/off, or the fan and coil cycle on/off together. The next two inputs define the minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature that the heat pump compressor will operate and the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for defrost operation. Crankcase heater capacity and cutout temperature are entered in the following two inputs. The final four inputs cover the type of defrost strategy (reverse-cycle or resistive), defrost control (timed or on-demand), the fractional defrost time period (timed defrost control only), and the resistive defrost heater capacity if a resistive defrost strategy is selected.

A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Heating Capacity}\label{field-gross-rated-heating-capacity-2}

This numeric field defines the total, full load gross heating capacity in watts of the DX coil unit at rated conditions (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 C, heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 C, heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 C, and a heating coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow volume below). The value entered here must be greater than 0. Capacity should not account for supply air fan heat. The gross rated heating capacity should be within 20\% of the gross rated total cooling capacity, otherwise a warning message is issued. The gross heating capacity should NOT include the effect of supply air fan heat.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Heating COP}\label{field-gross-rated-heating-cop}

This numeric field defines the coefficient of performance (COP = the gross heating capacity in watts divided by electrical power input in watts) of the DX heating coil unit at rated conditions (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 C, and a heating coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow volume rate below).

The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of the gross rated heating capacity. The gross rated heating capacity and gross rated COP should be performance information for the unit with outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 C, heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 C, heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 C, and the rated air volume flow rate defined here.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Evaporator Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate}\label{field-rated-evaporator-fan-power-per-volume-flow-rate-1}

This field is the electric power for the evaporator (heating coil) fan per air volume flow rate through the coil at the rated conditions in W/(m\(^{3}\)/s). The default value is 773.3 W/(m\(^{3}\)/s) (365 W/1000 cfm) if this field is left blank. If a value is entered, it must be \textgreater{} = 0.0 and \textless{} = 1250 W/(m\(^{3}\)/s). This value is only used to calculate High Temperature Heating Standard (Net) Rating Capacity, Low Temperature Heating Standard (Net) Rating Capacity and Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) which will be outputs in the EnergyPlus eio file (ref. EnergyPlus Engineering Reference, Single Speed DX Heating Coil, Standard Ratings). This value is not used for modeling the evaporator (heating coil) fan during simulations; instead, it is used for calculating the above standard ratings to assist the user in verifying their inputs for modeling this type of equipment.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name-13}

This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the DX heating coil draws its inlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-air-outlet-node-name-13}

This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the DX heating coil sends its outlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-heating-capacity-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic, quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the total heating capacity as a function of the both the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature or just the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature depending on the type of curve selected. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross total heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry-bulb temperature or outdoor air dry-bulb temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Heating Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-heating-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of total heating capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-3}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic, quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the both the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature or just the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature depending on the type of curve selected. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry-bulb temperature or outdoor air dry-bulb temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name-3}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name-6}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-defrost-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation}\label{field-minimum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-compressor-operation}


\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature to Turn On Compressor}\label{field-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-to-turn-on-compressor}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature when the compressor is automatically turned back on following an automatic shut off because of low outdoor temperature. This field is only used for the calculation heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) of heating coil. If this field is not provided, outdoor bin temperature is always considered to be greater than this temperature and Minimum Outdoor dry-bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation field described above.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-defrost-operation}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which outdoor coil defrosting is disabled. The temperature for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0 C and less than or equal to 7.22 C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 5 C.

\paragraph{Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity}\label{field-crankcase-heater-capacity-4}

This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. If this heating coil is used as part of an air-to-air heat pump (Ref. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir or ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump), the crankcase heater defined for this DX heating coil is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running for either heating or cooling (and the crankcase heater power defined in the DX cooling coil object is disregarded in this case). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0. To simulate a unit without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation-4}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor s crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0 C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 10 C.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Strategy}\label{field-defrost-strategy}

This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Control}\label{field-defrost-control}

This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value or compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field Defrost Time Period Fraction described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}\label{field-defrost-time-period-fraction}

This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active, and only applies to timed defrost (see Defrost Control input field above). For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.

\paragraph{Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity}\label{field-resistive-defrost-heater-capacity}

This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost strategy is resistive (see input field Defrost Strategy above). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Region Number}\label{field-region-number}

This optional numeric field defines the region number which is used to calculate HSPF of heating coil. The value for this input field must be between 1 and 6. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 4.

\paragraph{Field: Evaporator Air Inlet Node Name}\label{field-evaporator-air-inlet-node-name}

This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor evaporator. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the evaporator is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name for Evaporator Placement}\label{field-zone-name-for-evaporator-placement}

This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (evaporator) of a heat pump is installed. This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to extract heat from the zone via secondary coil. Heat extracted is modeled as internal gain. If the primary DX system is a heat pump, then the zone name should be the same as the zone name specified for placing the secondary cooling DX coil.

\paragraph{Field: Secondary Coil Air Flow Rate}\label{field-secondary-coil-air-flow-rate}

This input value is the secondary coil (evaporator) air flow rate when the heat pump is working in heating mode or the secondary coil (condenser) air flow rate when the heat pump is working in cooling mode. This input field is auto-sizable.

\paragraph{Field: Secondary Coil Fan Flow Scaling Factor}\label{field-secondary-coil-fan-flow-scaling-factor}

This input field is scaling factor for autosizing the secondary DX coil fan flow rate. The secondary air flow rate is determined by multiplying the primary DX coil rated air flow rate by the fan flow scaling factor. Default value is 1.25. If the secondary coil fan flow rate is not autosized, then the secondary coil fan flow scaling factor is set to 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Nominal Sensible Heat Ratio of Secondary Coil}\label{field-nominal-sensible-heat-ratio-of-secondary-coil}

This input value is the nominal sensible heat ratio used to split the heat extracted by a secondary DX coil (evaporator) of a heat pump into sensible and latent components. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then pure sensible internal heat gain is assumed, i.e., sensible heat ratio of 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-sensible-heat-ratio-modifier-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier biquadratic curve. The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary zone air node wet-bulb temperature and the heating DX coil entering air dry-bulb temperature. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then the nominal sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for temperature is set to 1.0.

\paragraph{Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-sensible-heat-ratio-modifier-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier curve as function of secondary air flow fraction. The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary coil air flow fraction. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then the sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for flow fraction is set to 1.0.

\subsection{Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed}\label{coilheatingdxmultispeed}

This component models a DX heating unit with multiple discrete levels of heating capacity. Currently, this heating coil can only be referenced by a AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed compound object. The multispeed DX heating coil can have from two to four operating speeds. When the coil operates at Speed 1 (the lowest speed), its performance is very similar to the Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed object where the impacts of part-load ratio can be included. When the coil operates at higher speeds (above Speed 1), the linear approximation methodology is applied. The coil outputs at two consecutive speeds are linearly interpolated to meet the required heating capacity during an HVAC system timestep. When the coil performs above the lowest speed, the user can choose if they want to include part-load ratio impacts at the higher speeds.

The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at different operating speeds. Each speed has its own set of input specifications: full load capacity, COP and air flow rate at rated conditions, along with modifier curves to determine performance when actual operating conditions are different from the rated conditions.

The coil operates to meet the sensible capacity being requested. When this requested capacity is above the sensible capacity of the highest operating speed, the coil runs continuously at the highest speed. When the requested capacity is between the sensible capacities of two consecutive speeds, the unit will operate a portion of the time at each speed to meet the request. When the requested capacity is less than the low speed (Speed 1) capacity, the unit will cycle on/off as needed.

The next input defines the minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature where the compressor will operate. The followed two inputs are related to crankcase heater operation: capacity and maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for crankcase heater operation. The next six inputs cover defrost operation: defrost EIR modifier curve, the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for defrost operation, the type of defrost strategy (reverse-cycle or resistive), defrost control (timed or on-demand), the fractional defrost time period (timed defrost control only), and the resistive defrost heater capacity if a resistive defrost strategy is selected. The activation of defrost is dependent on outdoor conditions. The capacity reduction and energy use modification are independent of speed. The defrost EIR modifier is described below:

The defrost energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: the heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the coil is operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is specified.

The next input allows the user to choose whether to apply the part load fraction correlation to speeds greater than 1 or not. The following input is the type of fuel.

Then the number of speed for heating is entered. The rest of inputs are speed dependent. Each set of data consists of gross rated heating capacity, gross rated COP, and the rated air volume flow rate. These three inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 °C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 °C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 °C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 °C). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and .00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity. The rated waste heat fraction is needed to calculate how much waste heat is available at the rated conditions. In addition, up to 6 modifier curves are required per speed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross total heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).
\item
  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
\item
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).
\item
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
\item
  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible heating load / steady-state heating capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
\item
  The waste heat modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating input energy, the waste heat fraction of heat input to give the recoverable waste heat.
\end{enumerate}

The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (ref. Performance Curves).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-20-001}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-19-001}

This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a multispeed DX heating coil. Any reference to this DX heating coil by another object will use this name. The only allowed parent is AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-11-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the multispeed DX heating coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Air Inlet Node name}\label{field-air-inlet-node-name-14}

This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the DX heating coil draws its inlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Air Outlet Node Name}\label{field-air-outlet-node-name-14}

This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the DX heating coil sends its outlet air.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation}\label{field-minimum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-compressor-operation-1}

This numeric field defines the minimum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature where the heating coil compressor turns off. If this input field is left blank, the default value is -8 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity}\label{field-crankcase-heater-capacity-5}

This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0. To simulate a unit without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation-5}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor s crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0 °C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 10 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-defrost-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-1}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-defrost-operation-1}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which outdoor coil defrosting is disabled. The temperature for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0 °C and less than or equal to 7.22 °C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 5 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Strategy}\label{field-defrost-strategy-1}

This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Control}\label{field-defrost-control-1}

This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value or compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field Defrost Time Period Fraction described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}\label{field-defrost-time-period-fraction-1}

This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active, and only applies to timed defrost (see Defrost Control input field above). For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.

\paragraph{Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity}\label{field-resistive-defrost-heater-capacity-1}

This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost strategy is resistive (see input field Defrost Strategy above). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.

\paragraph{Field: Apply Part Load Fraction to Speeds Greater than 1}\label{field-apply-part-load-fraction-to-speeds-greater-than-1-1}

This field determines whether part-load impacts on coil energy use are applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify a part-load fraction correlation for each speed to account for compressor start up losses (cycle on/off). For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, the part load losses may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify \textbf{No} for this input field to neglect part-load impacts on energy use at higher operating speeds. If part-load impacts on coil energy use are thought to be significant (e.g., interwined cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify \textbf{Yes} and the part-load fraction correlations specified for speeds 2 through 4 will be applied as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect part-load impacts when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off (i.e., the part-load fraction correlation for speed 1 is always applied).

\paragraph{Field: Fuel Type}\label{field-fuel-type-1-000}

This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the chiller uses. This field has seven choices: Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil\#1, FuelOil\#2, OtherFuel1 and OtherFuel2. This is a required field with no default.

\paragraph{Field: Number of Speeds}\label{field-number-of-speeds-2}

This field specifies the number of sets of data being entered for rated specifications, performance curves, and waste heat specifications for each cooling speed. The rated specifications consist of gross rated capacity, gross rated COP, and rated air flow rate. The performance curves consist of a total capacity modifier curve as a function of temperature, total capacity modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of temperature, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, and part load fraction correlation as a function of part load ratio. The waste heat specifications include the fraction of energy input to the heating coil at the fully loaded and rated conditions, and a temperature modifier. The minimum number of speeds for heating is 2 and the maximum number is 4. The number of speeds should be the same as the number of speeds for heating defined in its parent object (AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed). The first set of performance inputs is for Speed 1 and should be for low speed, and the last set of performance inputs should be for high speed. For example, if only three heating speeds are defined, the first set should be for low speed (Speed 1), the second set should be for medium speed (Speed 2), and the third set should be for high speed (Speed 3). In this example, any performance inputs for Speed 4 would be neglected (since this input field specifies that the coil only has three heating speeds).

\paragraph{Field Group: Rated Specification, Performance Curves, and Waste Heat Data}\label{field-group-rated-specification-performance-curves-and-waste-heat-data}

The performance for each heating speed must be specified as shown below. All inputs for Speed 1 are required first, followed by the inputs for Speed 2, Speed 3 and Speed 4.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Gross Rated Heating Capacity}\label{field-speed-x-gross-rated-heating-capacity}

This numeric field defines the total, full load gross heating capacity in watts of the DX coil unit at rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 °C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 °C, heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 °C, heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 °C, and a heating coil air flow rate defined by field Rated Air Flow Rate, Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} below). The value entered here must be greater than 0. The gross heating capacity should not account for the effect of supply air fan heat.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Gross Rated Heating COP}\label{field-speed-x-gross-rated-heating-cop}

This numeric field defines the coefficient of performance (COP = gross heating capacity in watts divided by electrical power input in watts) of the DX heating coil unit at rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 °C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 °C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 °C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 °C, and a heating coil air flow rate defined by field Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Rated Air Flow Rate below). The value entered here must be greater than 0. The input power includes power for the compressor(s) and outdoor fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the indoor supply air fan. The gross heating capacity is the value entered above in the field Gross Rated Heating Capacity . The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-speed-x-rated-air-flow-rate-1}

This numeric field defines the volume air flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, across the DX heating coil at rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation. The value entered here must be greater than 0. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m\(^{3}\)/s and 0.00006041 m\(^{3}\)/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity. The gross rated heating capacity and gross rated COP should be performance information for the unit with outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 °C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 °C, heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 °C, heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 °C, and the rated air volume flow rate defined here.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Heating Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-heating-capacity-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic, quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the total heating capacity as a function of the both the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature or just the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature depending on the type of curve selected. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross total heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry-bulb temperature or outdoor air dry-bulb temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Heating Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-heating-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of heating capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the gross heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-2}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic, quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the both the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature or just the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature depending on the type of curve selected. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry-bulb temperature or outdoor air dry-bulb temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name-1}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-speed-xpart-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF > = 0.7     and     PLF > = PLR
\end{lstlisting}

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX heating coil (Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Rated Waste Heat Fraction of Power Input}\label{field-speed-x-rated-waste-heat-fraction-of-power-input-1}

The fraction of heat input to heating that is available as recoverable waste heat at full load and rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Waste Heat Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-waste-heat-function-of-temperature-curve-name-1}

The name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the waste heat recovery as a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature and the entering coil dry-bulb temperature for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated recoverable waste heat at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. When the fuel type is electricity, the field is either left blank or ignored by the program. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed does not require waste heat calculations, this field is ignored. If the field is blank, a warning will be issued and simulation continues. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed requires waste heat calculations, if this field is left blank, the program assumes a constant value of 1 to make simulation continue and a warning will be issued.

\paragraph{Field: Zone Name for Evaporator Placement}\label{field-zone-name-for-evaporator-placement-1}

This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (evaporator) of a heat pump is installed. This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to extract heat from the zone via secondary coil. Heat extracted is modeled as internal gain.

\subsection{Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed}\label{coilheatingdxvariablespeed}

The Variable-Speed Air-to-Air Heating DX Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the heating coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit catalog data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The number of speed levels can range from 1 to 10. The heating coil has two air side node connections. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated capacity and rated volumetric air flow rate are sized. The gross rated capacity and rated volumetric flow rate represent the real situation in the air loop, and are used to determine the flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir, ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump, etc. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e.~the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rate at each individual speed and at the rated operating conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the single-speed DX coil. On the other hand, the performance values at individual speed levels, e.g.~capacities, COPs and flow rates, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with Reference Unit means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities and COPs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 21.1 ˚C (70 ˚F) and the source side entering air temperature of 8.3 ˚C (47 ˚F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields.

This numeric field contains the maximum number of speed levels that the module uses. The number of speeds, for which the user input the performance data and curves, has to be equal to or higher than the maximum number. The performance inputs at higher speeds are ignored.

\paragraph{Field: Nominal Speed Level}\label{field-nominal-speed-level-1}

This numeric field defines the nominal speed level, at which the rated capacity, rated air and volumetric flow rate are correlated.

\paragraph{Field: Gross Rated Heating Capacity at Selected Nominal Speed Level}\label{field-gross-rated-heating-capacity-at-selected-nominal-speed-level}

This numeric field contains the rated capacity at the nominal speed level. This field is autosizable. The gross rated heating capacity is used to determine a capacity scaling factor, as compared to the Reference Unit capacity at the nominal speed level.

\begin{equation}
\rm{CapacityScaleFactor} = \frac{{{\rm{Gross RatedTotalHeatingCapacity}}}}{{{\rm{ReferenceUnitCapacity}}@{\rm{NominalSpeedLevel}}}}
\end{equation}

And then, this scaling factor is used to determine capacities at rated conditions for other speed levels, as below,

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \rm{Gross RatedCapacity} @ \rm{SpeedLevel} \left( \rm{x} \right) = \\
    \quad \quad \quad \rm{CapacityScaleFactor} \times \\
    \quad \quad \quad \rm{ReferenceUnitCapacity} @ \rm{SpeedLevel}(\rm{x})
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Field: Rated Volumetric Air Flow Rate}\label{field-rated-volumetric-air-flow-rate}

This numeric field contains the rated volumetric air flow rate on the load side of the heat pump corresponding to the nominal speed level. This field is autosizable. The value is used to determine an internal scaling factor, and calculate the air flow rates in the parent objects. It is recommended that the ratio of the rated volumetric air flow rate to the rated capacity is the same as the unit performance from the Reference Unit data.

\begin{equation}
{\rm{AirFlowScaleFactor}} = \frac{{{\rm{RatedVolumetricAirFlowRate}}}}{{{\rm{ReferenceUnitVolAirFlowRate}}@{\rm{NominalSpeedLevel}} \times {\rm{CapacityScaleFactor}}}}
\end{equation}

And the volumetric air flow rates in the parent objects are calculated as below,

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{l}
    {\rm{LoopVolumetricAirFlowRate}}@{\rm{SpeedLevel}}\left( {\rm{x}} \right) = \\
    \quad \quad \quad {\rm{AirFlowScaleFactor}} \times \\
    \quad \quad \quad {\rm{ReferenceUnitVolAirFlowRate}}@{\rm{SpeedLevel}}({\rm{x}}) \times \\

\paragraph{Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name-7}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, heating load/steady-state heating capacity for Speed 1), in the case that the unit operates under the lowest speed, i.e.~on/off. The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-defrost-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-2}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity at the maximum speed level, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation}\label{field-minimum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-compressor-operation-2}

This numeric field defines the minimum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature where the heating coil compressor turns off. If this input field is left blank, the default value is -8 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature to Turn On Compressor}\label{field-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-to-turn-on-compressor-1}

This numeric field defines the outdoor temperature when the compressor is automatically turned back on following an automatic shut off because of low outdoor dry-bulb temperature. This field is only used for the calculation of HSPF. If this field is not provided, then outdoor bin temperature used in the HSPF calculation is always considered to be greater than this temperature and `Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation' field described above. This assumption is based on AHRI standard 210/240 (2008) and can introduce significant error in the final value of HSPF.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-defrost-operation-2}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which outdoor coil defrosting is disabled. The temperature for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0 °C and less than or equal to 7.22 °C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 5 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity}\label{field-crankcase-heater-capacity-6}

This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air drybulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0. To simulate a unit without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation}\label{field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation-6}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor s crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0 °C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 10 °C.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Strategy}\label{field-defrost-strategy-2}

This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse cycle.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Control}\label{field-defrost-control-2}

This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value or compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field Defrost Time Period Fraction described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.

\paragraph{Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction}\label{field-defrost-time-period-fraction-2}

This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active, and only applies to timed defrost (see Defrost Control input field above). For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.

\paragraph{Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity}\label{field-resistive-defrost-heater-capacity-2}

This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost strategy is resistive (see input field Defrost Strategy above). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.

\paragraph{Field Group: Rated specification and performance curves}\label{field-group-rated-specification-and-performance-curves}

The performance for each heating speed must be specified as shown below. They should be directly given from the Reference Unit data. All inputs for Speed 1 are required, followed by the optional inputs for other speeds.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Reference Unit Gross Rated Heating Capacity}\label{field-speed-x-reference-unit-gross-rated-heating-capacity}

This numeric field defines the total, full load gross heating capacity in watts of the air-to-air heating coil unit at rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation. The value entered here must be greater than 0. The gross heating capacity should not account for the effects of supply air fan heat.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Reference Unit Gross Rated Heating COP}\label{field-speed-x-reference-unit-gross-rated-heating-cop}

This numeric field defines the coefficient of performance (COP = gross heating capacityin watts divided by electrical power input in watts) of the heating coil unit at rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation. The value entered here must be greater than 0. The input power includes power for the compressor(s), the outdoor coil fan and accessories, but does not include the power consumption of the indoor supply air fan. The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Reference Unit Rated Air Flow Rate}\label{field-speed-x-reference-unit-rated-air-flow-rate-1}

This numeric field defines the volume air flow rate, in m\(^{3}\) per second, across the heating coil at rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation. The value entered here should be directly from the Reference Unit data, corresponding to the given gross rated heating capacity and gross rated heating COP at the speed, as above.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Heating Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-heating-capacity-function-of-temperature-curve-name-1}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the total heating capacity as a function of the indoor dry-bulb and source side entering air temperature, from the Reference Unit. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity at the speed to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry-bulb temperature or entering air temperature different from the rating point temperature). It should be noted that the curve is normalized to the heating capacity at Speed\textless{}x\textgreater{} from the Reference Unit data, and have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Heating Capacity Function of Air Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-heating-capacity-function-of-air-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross heating capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the design air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow), at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} from the Reference Unit data. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the design air flow rate at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name-3}

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the both the indoor air dry-bulb and entering air temperatures. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} from the Reference Unit data) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry bulb temperature or entering air temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Energy Input Ratio Function of Air Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-air-flow-fraction-curve-name-1}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the design air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow, at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} from the Reference Unit data). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the design air flow rate.

\subsection{Coil:WaterHeating:Desuperheater}\label{coilwaterheatingdesuperheater}

A simplified approach is used to determine the performance of this water heating coil. The model assumes that the heating energy provided by this coil is reclaimed from the superheated refrigerant gas leaving a compressor (i.e., a desuperheating refrigerant-to-water heating coil) and does not impact the performance of the compressor. This coil must be used with a water heater tank (e.g., WaterHeater:Mixed) which can supply heated potable water and/or hot water for use in a plant loop (e.g., hydronic air reheat coils).

Except for detailed refrigeration system models, the amount of available superheat is simply a percentage of the total heat being rejected by the DX system's condenser. Approximately 25-30\% of the energy rejected by typical refrigeration system condensers is to reduce the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature to the condensing temperature. Recovery efficiencies higher than 30\% may cause the refrigerant gas to condense which in turn impacts the performance of the refrigeration system. For this reason, the maximum heat reclaim recovery efficiency for this coil is 30\% for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 30\% limit is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 90\% of the heat within the superheated region.

The model includes the ability to modify the heat reclaim recovery efficiency based on variations in inlet water temperature and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature.

This coil model performs the following major functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  calculates the amount of heat delivered to the water tank
\item
  calculates the electricity consumption of the integral water pump and on/off-cycle parasitic loads
\end{itemize}

The input fields for this object are described below in detail:

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-22-000}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-21-000}

This alpha field contains a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a desuperheater water heating coil. Any reference to this desuperheater coil by another object will use this name.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-12-000}

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the desuperheater coil is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the desuperheater coil is off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the desuperheater coil is available to operate during that time period. During times when the desuperheater coil is scheduled off, the heater (element or burner) in the water tank object operates based on its tank set point temperature schedule and the desuperheater coil s parasitic electric power is also off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name}\label{field-setpoint-temperature-schedule-name}

This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that specifies the set point (or cut-out ) temperature for the desuperheater coil. Temperature values used in this schedule should be in degrees Celsius. The desuperheater coil turns off when the tank water reaches this set point temperature. Once the desuperheater coil is off, the tank water temperature floats downward until it falls below the set point temperature minus the dead band temperature difference defined below (i.e., the cut-in temperature). At this point, the desuperheater coil turns on and remains on until the desuperheater coil set point temperature is reached.

\paragraph{Field: Dead Band Temperature Difference}\label{field-dead-band-temperature-difference}

This numeric field contains the dead band temperature difference in degrees Celsius. The desuperheater coil cut-in temperature is defined as the desuperheater coil set point temperature defined above minus this dead band temperature difference. The desuperheater coil turns on when the water temperature in the tank falls below the cut-in temperature. The desuperheater coil remains on until the water temperature in the tank rises above the desuperheater coil set point ( cut-out ) temperature defined above. The dead band temperature difference must be greater than 0 °C and less than or equal to 20 °C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5 °C.

Desuperheater water heating coils are typically used to offset energy consumption by the water tank s heater (element or burner). Therefore, the cut-in temperature for the desuperheater coil (set point minus dead band temperature difference) is usually higher than the set point temperature for the heater (element or burner) in the associated water heater tank object. At times when the water heater tank set point temperature is greater than the cut-in temperature of the desuperheater coil, the model disables the desuperheater coil and the tank s heater is used to heat the water.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Heat Reclaim Recovery Efficiency}\label{field-rated-heat-reclaim-recovery-efficiency}

This numeric field defines the ratio of recovered waste heat from the superheated refrigerant gas to the total rejected waste heat from the heating source (as if no heat reclaim occurred). Input values must be greater than 0 up to a maximum value is 0.3 (with a defaults of 0.25) for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 0.3 limit is a source that is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 0.9. with a default value is 0.8.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Inlet Water Temperature}\label{field-rated-inlet-water-temperature-1}

This numeric field defines the coil inlet water temperature, in degrees Celsius, that corresponds to the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency. Also see field Heat Reclaim Efficiency Modifier Curve Name (function of temperature) below.

\paragraph{Field: Rated Outdoor Air Temperature}\label{field-rated-outdoor-air-temperature}

This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature, in degrees Celsius, that corresponds to the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency. The outdoor air dry-bulb temperature impacts the desuperheater coil refrigerant temperature and the amount of heat available for reclaim. Also see field Heat Reclaim Efficiency Modifier Curve Name(function of temperature) below.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Inlet Water Temperature for Heat Reclaim}\label{field-maximum-inlet-water-temperature-for-heat-reclaim}

This numeric field defines the maximum coil inlet water temperature in degrees Celsius. Any time the inlet water temperature to the desuperheater coil is above this maximum allowed temperature, heat reclaim is restricted so that the tank water does not exceed this temperature.

\paragraph{Field: Heat Reclaim Efficiency Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-heat-reclaim-efficiency-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field specifies the name of a bi-quadratic curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in heat reclaim efficiency as a function of inlet fluid (air and water) temperatures. The bi-quadratic curve uses the coil inlet water temperature and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (entering the DX coil condenser) as the independent variables. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency to give the heat reclaim efficiency at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures. If this field is left blank, the heat reclaim efficiency remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all conditions). The model restricts the product of the output of this curve and the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency to a maximum of 0.9 for refrigeration condenser sources and 0.3 for all other sources..

\paragraph{Field: Water Inlet Node Name}\label{field-water-inlet-node-name-4-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the water node from which the desuperheater heating coil draws its inlet water. This node name must also match the source side outlet node name for the water heater tank used with this coil (ref. Water Heaters).

\paragraph{Field: Water Outlet Node Name}\label{field-water-outlet-node-name-4-000}

This alpha field defines the name of the water node to which the desuperheater heating coil sends its outlet water. This node name must also match the source side inlet node name for the water heater tank used with this coil (ref. Water Heaters).

\paragraph{Field: Water Flow Rate}\label{field-water-flow-rate}

This numeric field defines the desuperheater coil s water flow rate in cubic meters per second. The model assumes that this flow rate is constant (throughout the simulation period) when the desuperheater coil operates, and that it corresponds to the heat reclaim recovery efficiency performance specified by the user. This water flow rate must be greater than zero.

\paragraph{Field: Water Pump Power}\label{field-water-pump-power}

This numeric field defines the coil s water circulation pump power in Watts. This is the operating pump power as installed. Values must be greater than or equal to 0. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0. A warning message will be issued if the ratio of water pump power to desuperheater water volumetric flow rate exceeds 7.9264E6 W/m\(^{3}\)/s, but the simulation will continue using the user-defined values. The model assumes that this integral pump (i.e., no need to define a separate pump object) cycles on and off with the desuperheater heating coil.

\paragraph{Field: Fraction of Pump Heat to Water}\label{field-fraction-of-pump-heat-to-water}

This numeric field defines the fraction of water circulation pump heat that is transferred to the water.

This optional numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the desuperheater water heating coil. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the desuperheater coil is available but is not operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water nor does it affect the zone air heat balance. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.

\subsection{CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}\label{coilsystemcoolingdx}

The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object is a virtual container component that consists of a DX cooling coil component and its associated controls, as shown in the Figure below. This control object supports several different types of DX cooling coils (see field Cooling Coil Object Type).

This component may be used as a cooling coil in constant volume or variable volume systems, as blow through or draw through, with or without humidity controls. Unlike AirLoopHVAC:Unitary system types, this component controls only the DX coil, not the supply fan. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX is added to a system by placing it in an air loop branch (see Branch object) or in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList or in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList . It requires one or more setpoint manager (see SetpointManager:*) objects to specify temperature and/or humidity setpoints (unless it is used in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit which has its own temperature setpoints). This object is the one that is listed in the Branch or equipment list object rather than the coil itself. A constant volume or variable volume fan is modeled separately from this cooling system. These are the only fan types allowed for this system type (ref. Fan:ConstantVolume and Fan:VariableVolume). Cycling fan operation is not available with this model. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object can also be placed on dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) airloop branches or in arloop branches where the air flow to capacity ratio range is between 100 300 cfm/ton. 100\% DOAS DX cooling coils operate in lower flow to capacity ratio range compared to regular DX cooling coils. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX is selected to operate in DOAS application or in low flow to capacity ratio range by specifying YES to the input field Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil . If this optional input field is left blank or specified as NO , then the coil is modeled as regular DX cooling coil. If the CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object is in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList or in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList then it is treated as 100\% DOAS DX cooling coil only if the choice input field Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil is set too YES . All the control options of the regular DX cooling coils are available to DOAS DX coils as well. Heating DX coils in DOAS airloop operate at the same flow to capacity ratio limits as the DOAS DX cooling coils.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-23-000}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-22-000}

This alpha field contains the identifying name for this component.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-13-000}

This alpha field contains the schedule name that contains information on the availability of the DX coil to operate. A schedule value of 0 indicates that the coil is off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the coil can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: DX Cooling Coil System Inlet Node Name}\label{field-dx-cooling-coil-system-inlet-node-name}

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the DX cooling coil inlet node, as specified in the DX cooling coil object.

\paragraph{Field: DX Cooling Coil System Outlet Node Name}\label{field-dx-cooling-coil-system-outlet-node-name}

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the DX cooling coil outlet node, as specified in the cooling coil object.

\paragraph{Field: DX Cooling Coil System Sensor Node Name}\label{field-dx-cooling-coil-system-sensor-node-name}

This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the DX cooling coil control node, this is the node at which the temperature set point is specified by the set point manager.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Coil Object Type}\label{field-cooling-coil-object-type-000}

This alpha field specifies the type of DX cooling coil. The valid choices for this field are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed
\item
  CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
\item
  Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Coil Name}\label{field-cooling-coil-name-000}

This alpha field contains the identifying name of the DX cooling coil.

As shown in the example below, correct specification of this system requires specification of the DX Cooling Coil object in addition to the CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object.

\paragraph{Field: Dehumidification Control Type}\label{field-dehumidification-control-type}

This alpha field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:

\textbf{None} - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control

\textbf{MultiMode} - activate enhanced dehumidification mode as needed and operate to meet the sensible load. If a sensible load exists, the system will operate to meet that sensible load and may not meet the latent load. If no sensible load exists, and Run on Latent Load = Yes, the system will operate to meet the entire latent load. This option is used to model DX equipment with a switchable option such as subcool reheat. It is valid only with Cooling coil type = Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode or CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted. If the Run on Latent Load option below is set to Yes, this option may require the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point.

\textbf{CoolReheat} - cool beyond the dry-bulb setpoint as required to meet the humidity setpoint. It is valid only with Cooling coil type = Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode. This option requires the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point.

The default is \textbf{None}. For all dehumidification controls, the max humidity setpoint on the control node is used. This must be set using a \textbf{ZoneControl:Humidistat} \textbf{ZoneControl:Humidistat} and one of:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum}
\item
  \textbf{SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum}
\item
  \textbf{SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average}
\end{itemize}

objects and \textbf{SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat} (optional) objects. When extra dehumidification is required, the equipment may not be able to meet the humidity setpoint if its full capacity is not adequate.

\paragraph{Field: Run on Sensible Load}\label{field-run-on-sensible-load}

This alpha field specifies if the unit will operate to meet a sensible load as determined by the inlet node dry-bulb temperature and the dry-bulb temperature setpoint on the control node. There are two valid choices, \textbf{Yes} or \textbf{No}. If \textbf{Yes}, unit will run if there is a sensible load. If \textbf{No}, unit will not run if there is only a sensible load. The default is \textbf{Yes}.

\paragraph{Field: Run on Latent Load}\label{field-run-on-latent-load}

This alpha field specifies if the unit will operate to meet a latent load as determined by the inlet node humidity ratio and the max humidity setpoint on the control node. There are two valid choices, \textbf{Yes} or \textbf{No}. If \textbf{Yes}, unit will run if there is a latent load. If both a sensible and latent load exist, the system will operate to maintain the temperature set point. When only a latent load exists, the system will operate to meet the humidity ratio set point and requires the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point. If \textbf{No}, unit will not run if there is only a latent load. The default is \textbf{No}.

\paragraph{Field: Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil}\label{field-use-outdoor-air-dx-cooling-coil}

This input field enables the Coil System DX Coil to be used for low air flow to capacity ratio range ( 100 300 cfm/ton). This flow to capacity ratio range is common in 100\% dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) applications. Other airloop or zone HVAC systems may use this input filed if they operate at such a low flow to capacity ratio range. There are two valid choices, \textbf{Yes} or \textbf{No}. If \textbf{Yes}, the DX cooling coil is forced to operate in this flow to capacity ratio range or runs as 100\% DOAS DX coil. If \textbf{No}, DX coil is used as regular DX coil. This input field is optional.

\paragraph{Field: Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil Leaving Minimum Air Temperature}\label{field-outdoor-air-dx-cooling-coil-leaving-minimum-air-temperature}

This input field is the DX cooling coil leaving supply air minimum temperature specified for frost control. The DX cooling coil leaving air temperature is not allowed to exceed this minimum coil leaving air temperature. The DX cooling coil frost controller adjusts or limits the desired coil outlet air setpoint temperature when the coil outlet temperature exceeds this minimum temperature limit specified. This input field is optional and only used along with in the input field above. The minimum and maximum values of this input field are 0.0 °C and 7.2 °C, and the default value is 2.0 °C.

\paragraph{Coil System Cycling Ratio}\label{coil-system-cycling-ratio}

The system may operate for the entire system timestep, but to meet the load the compressor can cycle on and off. This reports the fraction of the system timestep that the compressor is operating. (1.0 is continuous, 0.0 is off). For Coil:Cooling:VariableSpeed this description is true when compressor speed = 1. At higher compressor speeds Coil System Cycling Ratio = 1.

\paragraph{Coil System Compressor Speed Ratio}\label{coil-system-compressor-speed-ratio}

This is the ratio of time in a system timestep that the compressor is at rated speed. The compressor speed ratio reports (1.0 is max, 0.0 is min) and any value in between as it is averaged over the timestep. This report is a duplicate of the report in Coil:Cooling:DX:VaraibleSpeed named Cooling Coil Neighboring Speed Levels Ratio.

\paragraph{Coil System Compressor Speed Number}\label{coil-system-compressor-speed-ratio}

This is the stage number that the compressor is operating at in a system timestep. The compressor speed number (from 1 to number of speeds) is reported and averaged over the timestep. This report is a duplicate of the report in Coil:Cooling:DX:VaraibleSpeed named Cooling Coil Upper Speed Level.

\paragraph{Coil System Part Load Ratio}\label{coil-system-part-load-ratio}

The DX system can operate with a cycling compressor or a varying speed compressor. This variable reports the fraction of the Full Load that is met during the system timestep. This can differ from the cycling part load ratio or the compressor speed ratio. (1.0 is Full Load and 0.0 is no load)

\paragraph{Coil System Frost Control Status}\label{coil-system-frost-control-status}

This is a flag indicating whether frost control is active at current time step or not. Frost control is activated or enforced when the sensible load control requires DX cooling coil outlet air temperature below the user specified minimum temperature or when the dehumidification load control requires DX cooling coil outlet air humidity ratio below the saturation humidity ratio corresponding to the user specified minimum temperature for frost control. Frost control status of zero means no active frost control, a value of 1 or 2 indicates that frost control is active. If frost control status is 1, then the frost control was enforced when the cooling coil is run to meet sensible load. If the frost control status value is 2, then the control was enforced when the cooling coil is run to meet latent load. When frost control is active the DX cooling coil setpoint value is modified based on user specified limit.

\subsection{CoilSystem:Heating:DX}\label{coilsystemheatingdx}

The CoilSystem:Heating:DX object is a virtual container component for a DX heating coil that provides the controls needed to operate the coil. Only single speed DX air-to-air heating coils are supported.

This component may be used as a heating coil in constant volume or variable volume air handlers. It can also be used in an outside air system (by including it in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList object)or in a zone outdoor air unit (by including it in an ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList object). This object is the one that is listed in the Branch or equipment list object rather than the coil itself.

The inlet and outlet nodes for the DX heat pump system are defined in the heating coil object. The control node is always the outlet node of the coil. This DX heat pump heating system requires that a (drybulb) temperature setpoint be placed on the outlet node using either a setpoint manager or the energy management system. The coil is controlled to attempt to meet that setpoint using a part load ratio modeling approach.

This model only supports continuous fan and cycling compressor operation -- cycling fan modeling is not available with this model.

\paragraph{Coil System Part Load Ratio}\label{coil-system-part-load-ratio-1}

The DX system can operate with a cycling compressor or a varying speed compressor, This variable reports the fraction of the Full Load that is met during the system timestep. This can differ from the cycling part load ratio or the compressor speed ratio. (1.0 is Full Load and 0.0 is no load)

\subsection{CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}\label{coilsystemcoolingdxheatexchangerassisted}

The heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil is a virtual component consisting of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil and an air-to-air heat exchanger as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-dx} below. The air-to-air heat exchanger pre-conditions the air entering the cooling coil, and reuses this energy to post-condition the supply air leaving the cooling coil. This heat exchange process improves the latent removal performance of the cooling coil by allowing it to dedicate more of its cooling capacity toward dehumidification (lower sensible heat ratio).

This compound object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger in conjunction with a cooling coil. The heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil does not have an operating schedule of its own; its operating schedule is governed by the availability schedules for the DX cooling coil and the air-to-air heat exchanger. This compound object is used in place of where a DX cooling coil object would normally be used by itself.

To model a heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil, the input data file should include the following objects:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted object
\item
  Air-to-air heat exchanger object (HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate, HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent, or HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow)
\item
  DX cooling coil object (Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed or Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed)
\end{itemize}

In terms of controlling the operation of the heat exchanger, the heat exchanger is assumed to always provide its heat transfer when the associated DX cooling coil is operating and no high humidity control mechanism is specified. However, the heat exchanger s energy transfer may be controlled (i.e., turned on and off) based on a zone air humidity level using either a humidistat (ref. AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool or AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool) or a humidistat and a maximum humidity set point manager to place a humidity ratio set point on the appropriate control node (ref. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX). This model may also be used with the unitary changeover bypass system and the unitary air-to-air heat pump system (ref. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass and AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir); however, the heat exchanger is assumed to always provide its heat transfer when the cooling coil operates and cannot be turned on and off based on a zone air humidity set point. Two zone air conditioners may also use this model for improved dehumidification. The first type is the packaged terminal heat pump (ref. ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump) where the heat exchanger s heat transfer is always active whenever the cooling coil operates. The second type is the window air conditioner (ref. ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner) where the heat exchanger s heat transfer is always active when the cooling coil operates and no high humidity control mechanism is specified, OR the heat exchanger s heat transfer may be controlled based on zone air humidity level if a humidistat and high humidity set point manager are specified (maximum humidity ratio set point placed on the heat exchanger s exhaust air outlet node, ref. Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-dx}).

Links to the cooling coil and air-to-air heat exchanger specifications are provided in the input data syntax for this compound object. A description of each input field for this compound object is provided below.

\subsection{CoilSystem:IntegratedHeatPump:AirSource}\label{ASIHPIO}

CoilSystem:IntegratedHeatPump:AirSource is a collection of all the working modes in an air-source integrated heat pump, including space cooling (SC), space heating (SH), dedicated water heating (DWH), combined space cooling and water heating with full condensing(SCWH), combined space cooling and water heating with desuperheating (SCDWH), combined space heating and water heating with desuperheating (SHDWH). These working modes should also be referred to in other related air loop or water loop parent objects, for example, AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem and WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser, to represent the air side and water side node connections, and facilitate iterating the speed to match the space conditioning or water heating load. In addition, CoilSystem:IntegratedHeatPump:AirSource contains a series of criteria for selecting a working mode at the beginning of each timestep.

\paragraph{Field: Space Cooling Mode Coil Name}\label{Field-Space-Cooling-Mode-Coil-Name-ASIHP}

This alpha field defines the space cooling (SC) mode in an ASIHP, which must be given. The SC mode refers to the name of a Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed object, which contains all the performance curves and rated values to describe the space cooling operation.

The SCWH mode refers to the name of a Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:VariableSpeed object, which contains all the performance curves and rated values to describe the water heating operation with an indoor air source. The SCWH mode is connected to the same WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser as the DWH mode, and the same air side node connections as the SC mode. 

\paragraph{Field: SCDWH Mode Cooling Coil Name}\label{Field-SCDWH-Mode-Cooling-Coil-Name-ASIHP}

This alpha field defines the cooling operation in the combined space cooling and water heating with desuperheating (SCDWH) mode in an ASIHP, which must be given. These should be a different object from the SC mode. It should be noted that the rated power and power correction curves are contained in the Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed object. That means the power consumption at each speed level of the SCDWH mode is accounted for by the cooling coil part.

\paragraph{Field: SCDWH Mode Water Heating Coil Name}\label{Field-SCDWH-Mode-Water-Heating-Coil-Name-ASIHP}

This alpha field defines the water heating operation in the combined space cooling and water heating with desuperheating (SCDWH) mode in an ASIHP, which must be given. The power values and curves in the Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:VariableSpeed are not used. That means the power consumption at each speed level of the SCDWH mode is accounted for by the cooling coil part.

\paragraph{Field: SHDWH Mode Heating Coil Name}\label{Field-SHDWH-Mode-Heating-Coil-Name-ASIHP}

This alpha field defines the heating operation in the combined space heating and water heating with desuperheating (SHDWH) mode in an ASIHP, which must be given. This should be a different object from the SH mode. It should be noted that the rated power and power correction curves are contained in the Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed object. That means the power consumption at each speed level of the SHDWH mode is accounted for by the cooling coil part.

\paragraph{Field: SHDWH Mode Water Heating Coil Name}\label{Field-SHDWH-Mode-Water-Heating-Coil-Name-ASIHP}

This alpha field defines the water heating operation in the combined space heating and water heating with desuperheating (SCDWH) mode in an ASIHP, which must be given. The power values and curves in the Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:VariableSpeed are not used. That means the power consumption at each speed level of the SHDWH mode is accounted for by the heating coil part.

\paragraph{Field: SCWH Mode Minimum Indoor Temperature to Allow  Overcooling}\label{Field-SCWH-Minimum-In-Overcooling-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines an indoor air temperature [C] above which indoor overcooling is allowed in the cooling operation, i.e., allowing running the SCWH mode to cool down the indoor air below the thermostat setting temperature, and iterate the compressor speed to match the water heating load. It has to be noted that both the indoor temperature and ambient temperature lower bound settings have to be satisfied when allowing indoor overcooling by running the SCWH mode. 


\paragraph{Field: SCWH Mode Minimum Outdoor Temperature to Allow Overcooling}\label{Field-SCWH-Minimum-Outdoor-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines an ambient air temperature above which indoor overcooling is allowed in the cooling operation, i.e., allowing running the SCWH mode to cool down the indoor air below the thermostat setting temperature, and iterate the compressor speed to match the water heating load. It has to be noted that both the indoor temperature and ambient temperature lower bound settings have to be satisfied when allowing overcooling the indoor by running the SCWH mode. 

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Indoor Temperature to Ignore Space Heating Call}\label{Field-Minimum-Indoor-IgnoreSH-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines an indoor air temperature [C] above which the water heating request has the higher priority and the space heating call can be ignored. The ASIHP will run the DWH mode to match the water heating load regardless of space heating call. It has to be noted that both the indoor temperature and ambient temperature lower bound settings have to be satisfied when a space heating call can be ignored. 


\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outdoor Temperature to Ignore Space Heating Call}\label{Field-Minimum-Outdoor-IgnoreSH-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines an ambient air temperature [C] above which the water heating request has the higher priority and the space heating call can be ignored. The ASIHP will run the DWH mode to match the water heating load regardless of space heating call. It has to be noted that both the indoor temperature and ambient temperature lower bound settings have to be satisfied when a space heating call can be ignored. 


\paragraph{Field: SCWH Mode Load Matching Type}\label{Field-SCWH-Matching-Type-ASIHP}

This choice field specifies the control in the SCWH mode. The choices are CoolingLoad or WaterHeatingLoad. During the SCWH operation when both the space cooling and water heating calls exist, if the field is CoolingLoad, it means that the compressor speed is iterated to match the space cooling load, and the water heating energy is a byproduct.  If this field is WaterHeatingLoad, it means that the speed is altered to match the water heating load, and the space cooling energy is a byproduct. 



\paragraph{Field: SCWH Mode Minimum Speed}\label{Field-SCWH-Minimum-Speed-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines a minimum speed level for running the SCWH; i.e., the compressor speed will be altered between the minimum speed specified and top speed, responding to the simultaneous space cooling and water heating calls. If there is only a water heating call, this input will not be used. 

\paragraph{Field: SCDWH Mode Maximum Heated Water Vol Before Switching to SCWH}\label{Field-SCDWH-Max-Water-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines an accumulative, heated water volume [m3] before switching from SCDWH to SCWH mode. When there are simultaneous space cooling and water heating calls, the ASIHP will run SCDWH first to satisfy a small water heating load. If the water volume heated by the heat pump goes beyond the limit, it means that the SCDWH, which uses a desuperheater, cannot provide enough capacity for the water heating request, and thus the SCWH mode will be turned on. 



\paragraph{Field: SCDWH Mode Minimum Speed}\label{Field-SCDWH-MinSped-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines a minimum speed level for running the SCDWH; i.e., the compressor speed will be altered between the minimum speed specified and top speed to match the space cooling load, and the water heating energy is a byproduct. 

\paragraph{Field: SHDWH Mode Time Limit Before Turning on Electric Water Heating Element}\label{Field-SHDWH-HeatElemement-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines the running time [s] of the SHDWH mode before electric heating elements in the connected water tank are turned on if the water heating request cannot be satisfied on time. When there are simultaneous space heating and water heating calls, the ASIHP will run SHDWH mode first to satisfy a small water heating load. If the running time goes beyond the time limit, it means that the SHDWH mode, which uses a desuperheater, cannot provide enough capacity for the water heating request, and thus the electric elements in the water tank will be turned on to supplement the heating capacity.

\paragraph{Field: SHDWH Mode Minimum Speed}\label{Field-SHDWH-Mode-Minimum-Speed-ASIHP}

This numeric field defines a minimum speed level for running the SHDWH mode; i.e., the compressor speed will be altered between the minimum speed and top speed to match the space heating load. Consequently, the water heating capacity is the byproduct.

\subsection{CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted}\label{coilsystemcoolingwaterheatexchangerassisted}

The heat exchanger-assisted water cooling coil is a virtual component consisting of a chilled-water cooling coil and an air-to-air heat exchanger as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-water} below. The air-to-air heat exchanger precools the air entering the cooling coil, and reuses this energy to reheat the supply air leaving the cooling coil. This heat exchange process improves the latent removal performance of the cooling coil by allowing it to dedicate more of its cooling capacity toward dehumidification (lower sensible heat ratio).

\end{figure}

Note: Node naming shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-water} is representative for HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent. For HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate, the exhaust air nodes are referred to as secondary air nodes.

This compound object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger in conjunction with a chilled-water cooling coil. The heat exchanger-assisted water cooling coil does not have an operating schedule of its own; its operating schedule is governed by the availability schedules for the chilled-water cooling coil and the air-to-air heat exchanger. Heat exchange will occur whenever the heat exchanger is available to operate (via its availability schedule) and a temperature difference exists between the two air streams -- there is currently no method to enable or disable heat exchange based on zone air humidity level. This compound object is used in place of where a chilled-water cooling coil object would normally be used by itself.

To model a heat exchanger-assisted water cooling coil, the input data file should include the following objects:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted compound object
\item
  Air-to-air heat exchanger object (HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate or HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent)

\subsection{Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped}\label{coilwaterheatingairtowaterheatpumppumped}

EnergyPlus can model a heat pump water heater (HPWH) consisting of a water heater tank (e.g., \lstinline!WaterHeater:Mixed!), a direct expansion (DX) coil (i.e., an air-to-water DX compression system which includes a water heating coil, air coil, compressor, and water pump), and a fan to provide air flow across the air coil associated with the DX compression system. These objects work together to model a system which heats water using zone air, outdoor air, or a combination of zone and outdoor air as the primary heat source.

The \lstinline!WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser! compound object, water heater tank object (e.g., \lstinline!WaterHeater:Mixed!), and fan object (e.g., \lstinline!Fan:OnOff!) are defined elsewhere in this reference document. \lstinline!Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped! object described here models an air-to-water DX compression system to determine its air-side and water-side performance. This DX coil object calculates the air-side sensible and latent cooling capacity at the specific operating conditions for each simulation timestep, as well as the condenser's water-side temperature difference at a given condenser water flow rate.

The heat pump water heater DX coil model performs the following major functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  calculates the electric consumption of the DX compressor and water pump
\item
  calculates the amount of heat delivered to the water tank
\item
  calculates the electric consumption of the compressor's crankcase heater

The cubic curve uses evaporator inlet air (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) temperature as the independent variable. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heating capacity to give the heating capacity at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heating capacity and the output from the two other heating capacity modifier curves (function of temperature and function of air flow fraction) to give the DX coil heating capacity at the specific inlet fluid temperatures and flow rates at which the coil is operating. The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rated condenser water flow rate (water flow fraction of 1.0). If this field is left blank, the heating capacity remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all water flow rates).

\paragraph{Field: Heating COP Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-heating-cop-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This alpha field specifies the name of a \textbf{biquadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in DX coil heating COP as a function of inlet fluid (air and water) temperatures. The biquadratic curve uses evaporator inlet air temperature (dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature based on the field Evaporator Air Temperature Type for Curve Objects defined above) and condenser inlet water temperature as the independent variables. The cubic curve uses evaporator inlet air (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) temperature as the independent variable. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated COP to give the heating COP at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures. If this field is left blank, the COP remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all conditions).

\paragraph{Field: Heating COP Function of Air Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-heating-cop-function-of-air-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This alpha field specifies the name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in DX coil heating COP as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the evaporator coil to the rated evaporator air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated COP and the heating COP modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the heating COP at the specific inlet fluid temperatures and air flow rate at which the coil is operating. The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rated evaporator air flow rate (air flow fraction of 1.0). If this field is left blank, the heating COP remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all air flow rates).

\paragraph{Field: Heating COP Function of Water Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-heating-cop-function-of-water-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This alpha field specifies the name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in DX coil heating COP as a function of the ratio of actual water flow rate through the condenser to the rated condenser water flow rate.. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated COP and the output from the two other heating COP modifier curves (function of temperature and function of air flow fraction) to give the DX coil heating COP at the specific inlet fluid temperatures and flow rates at which the coil is operating. The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rated condenser water flow rate (water flow fraction of 1.0). If this field is left blank, the heating COP remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all water flow rates).

\paragraph{Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name-8}

This alpha field defines the name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

\item
  calculates the amount of heat delivered to the water tank
\item

If this field is left blank or autocalculated (field value = \textbf{autocalculate}), the default value is 5.035E-5 m\(^{3}\)/s/W (31.25 cfm/MBH) multiplied by the Rated Heating Capacity specified above.

The cubic curve uses evaporator inlet air (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) temperature as the independent variable. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heating capacity to give the heating capacity at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures. If this field is left blank, the heating capacity remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all conditions).

\paragraph{Field: Heating Capacity Function of Air Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-heating-capacity-function-of-air-flow-fraction-curve-name-1}

This alpha field specifies the name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in DX coil heating capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the evaporator coil to the rated evaporator air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the DX coil heating capacity at the specific inlet fluid temperatures and air flow rate at which the coil is operating. The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rated evaporator air flow rate (air flow fraction of 1.0). If this field is left blank, the heating capacity remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all air flow rates).

\paragraph{Field: Heating COP Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-heating-cop-function-of-temperature-curve-name-1}

This alpha field specifies the name of a \textbf{biquadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in DX coil heating COP as a function of inlet fluid (air and water) temperatures. The biquadratic curve uses evaporator inlet air temperature (dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature based on the field Evaporator Air Temperature Type for Curve Objects defined above) and condenser inlet water temperature as the independent variables. The cubic curve uses evaporator inlet air (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) temperature as the independent variable. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated COP to give the heating COP at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures. If this field is left blank, the COP remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all conditions).

\paragraph{Field: Heating COP Function of Air Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-heating-cop-function-of-air-flow-fraction-curve-name-1}

This alpha field specifies the name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in DX coil heating COP as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the evaporator coil to the rated evaporator air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated COP and the heating COP modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the heating COP at the specific inlet fluid temperatures and air flow rate at which the coil is operating. The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rated evaporator air flow rate (air flow fraction of 1.0). If this field is left blank, the heating COP remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all air flow rates).

\paragraph{Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name}\label{field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name-9}

This alpha field defines the name of a \textbf{quadratic} or \textbf{cubic} performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit}\label{coilcoolingwatertoairheatpumpvariablespeedequationfit}

The Variable-Speed Water-to-Air Cooling Equation Fit Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the cooling coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. On the other hand, the model uses the bypass factor approach to calculate sensible heat transfer rate, similar to the one used in the single-speed DX coil. The number of speed levels can range from 2 to 10. The cooling coil has four node connections, i.e.~two air sides and two water sides. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated total cooling capacity, rated volumetric air and water flow rates are sized. The rated capacity, rated volumetric flow rates represent the real situation in the air and water loops, and are used to determine and flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir and ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e.~the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rates at each individual speed and at the rated conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the DX coils. However, the performance values, e.g.~gross capacities, gross COPs, gross SHRs and flow rates at individual speed levels, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with Reference Unit means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities, COPs and SHRs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 26.67 ˚C (80 ˚F), wet bulb temperature of 19.44 ˚C (67 ˚F), and the source side entering water temperature of 29.4 ˚C (85 ˚F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields. For a detailed description of the algorithm and how the curves are used in the calculations, please see the Engineering Reference.

This numeric field defines the nominal time (in seconds) after startup for condensate to begin leaving the coil's condensate drain line at the coil's rated airflow and temperature conditions, starting with a dry coil. Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero.

\paragraph{Field: Ratio of Initial Moisture Evaporation Rate and Steady State Latent Capacity}\label{field-ratio-of-initial-moisture-evaporation-rate-and-steady-state-latent-capacity-5}

This numeric field defines ratio of the initial moisture evaporation rate from the cooling coil (when the compressor first turns off, in Watts) and the coil's steady-state latent capacity (Watts) at rated airflow and temperature conditions. Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero.

\paragraph{Field: Flag for Using Hot Gas Reheat, 0 or 1}\label{field-flag-for-using-hot-gas-reheat-0-or-1}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible or latent load/steady-state sensible or latent cooling capacity for Speed 1), in the case that the unit operates under the lowest speed, i.e.~on/off. The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0. A typical part load fraction correlation would be:

\begin{equation}
PLF = 0.85 + 0.15 \times PLR
\end{equation}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
PLF = 0.85 + 0.0 \times PLR
\end{equation}

The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} from the Reference Unit data) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air wet-bulb temperature or entering water temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Energy Input Ratio Function of Air Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-air-flow-fraction-curve-name-2}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the design air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow, at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} from the Reference Unit data). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the design air flow rate.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Energy Input Ratio Function of Water Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-water-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual water flow rate across the cooling coil to the design water flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow, at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} from the Reference Unit data). This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the design air flow rate.

The actual EIR at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{}, considering variations in temperatures, air and water flow rates is calculated as below:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{l}
    ActualEIR@SpeedLevel\left( x \right) = \frac{{1.0}}{{ReferenceUnitCOP@SpeedLevel(x)}} \\
    \quad \quad \quad \times EIRTempModFac@SpeedLevel(x) \\
    \quad \quad \quad \times EIRAirFlowModFac@SpeedLevel(x) \\
    \quad \quad \quad \times EIRWaterFlowModFac@SpeedLevel(x)
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

And, the actual power consumption is calculated:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{l}
    ActualPower@SpeedLevel\left( x \right) = ActualCapacity@SpeedLevel\left( x \right) \\
    \quad \quad \quad \quad  \times ActualEIR@SpeedLevel\left( x \right)
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Reference Unit Waste Heat Fraction of Power Input}\label{field-speed-x-reference-unit-waste-heat-fraction-of-power-input}

The fraction of heat input to cooling that is available as recoverable waste heat at full load and rated conditions for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} operation. The part of heat is not discharged to the water loop. And it can be used for hot gas reheating during dehumidification operation, by setting 1 to Flag for Using Hot Gas Reheat.

\paragraph{Field: Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} Waste Heat Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-x-waste-heat-function-of-temperature-curve-name-2}

The name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the waste heat recovery as a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature and the entering water temperature for Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} from the Reference Unit data. The output of this curve is multiplied by the design recoverable waste heat at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point.

The actual recoverable waste heat at Speed \textless{}x\textgreater{} is calculated as below:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{l}
    ActualWasteHeat@SpeedLevel\left( x \right) = ActualPower@SpeedLevel\left( x \right) \\
    \quad \quad \quad \quad \times WasteHeatFrac@SpeedLevel(x) \\
    \quad \quad \quad \quad \times WasteHeatTempModFac@SpeedLevel(x)
  \end{array}

\paragraph{Cooling Coil Electric Power {[}W{]}}\label{cooling-coil-electric-power-w-3}

This output variable is the average electric consumption rate of the heat pump in Watts over the timestep being reported.

\paragraph{Cooling Coil Total Cooling Rate {[}W{]}}\label{cooling-coil-total-cooling-rate-w-9}

The output variable is the average total cooling load provide by the heat pump which includes the sensible and latent load in Watts over the timestep being reported.

\paragraph{Cooling Coil Sensible Cooling Rate {[}W{]}}\label{cooling-coil-sensible-cooling-rate-w-9}

The output variable is the average sensible cooling load provide by the heat pump in Watts over the timestep being reported.

\paragraph{Cooling Coil Source Side Heat Transfer Rate {[}W{]}}\label{cooling-coil-source-side-heat-transfer-rate-w-2}

The output variable is the average heat rejected to the water at the heat pump condenser in Watts over the timestep being reported.

\paragraph{Cooling Coil Part Load Ratio {[]}}\label{cooling-coil-part-load-ratio-2}

This output variable is the ratio of the part-load capacity to the steady state capacity of the VSWatertoAirHP coil. For the cycling fan mode, the runtime fraction for the heat pump compressor may be different from the compressor part-load ratio reported here due to the part-load performance of the VSWatertoAirHP coil (delay at start-up to reach steady-state output). In general, runtime fractions are reported by individual components where appropriate.

\paragraph{Cooling Coil Runtime Fraction {[]}}\label{cooling-coil-runtime-fraction-7}

This output variable is the function of the part load ratio (PLR, part-load capacity/ steady state capacity). The duty factor or runtime fraction accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

\paragraph{Cooling Coil Air Mass Flow Rate {[}kg/s{]}}\label{cooling-coil-air-mass-flow-rate-kgs-2}

The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the rated capacity, rated volumetric air and water flow rates are sized. The rated capacity, rated volumetric flow rates represent the real situation in the air and water loops, and are used to determine the flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir and ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e.~the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rates at each individual speed and at the rated operating conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the DX coils. On the other hand, the performance values at individual speed levels, e.g.~capacities, COPs and flow rates, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data.

For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 \textless{} = PLR \textless{} 1), the following rules apply:

PLF \textgreater{} = 0.7 and PLF \textgreater{} = PLR

If PLF \textless{} 0.7, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF \textless{} PLR, the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0. A typical part load fraction correlation would be:

\begin{equation}
PLF = 0.85 + 0.15 \times PLR
\end{equation}

If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
PLF = 0.85 + 0.0 \times PLR
\end{equation}

\subsection{Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage}\label{coilcoolingdxsinglespeedthermalstorage}

This object models a special direct expansion (DX) cooling coil that includes methods of storing thermal energy within the cooling coil package. This packaged thermal storage cooling coil model includes all of the equipment needed to charge and discharge and the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank itself. This coil object is used with CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object and a constant volume supply fan, but all other subcomponents are contained within the package.

Some types of devices may have a process air cooling section that actually has two coils, one an evaporator and the second some other kind of coil that cools by discharging the TES tank. There may also be two separate heat engines inside the package with two compressors. The model wraps these complexities inside of the model which considers just one process air cooling section that combines both types of coils and one heat rejection condenser section that rejects heat from both engines. The operating modes that are likely to have two heat engines offer dual sets of rating points and performance curves to model the energy and capacity implications separately.

The model offers various modes of operation that can be controlled over time using either a schedule or EMS actuators. The user can choose which of the five operating modes are present in the device. Each of the modes has its own separate set of performance characteristics and curves and the model can change abruptly from one mode to the next. For example when using the schedule control, the TES coil can be put into Charge Only Mode for some number of hours at night, operated in Cooling Only Mode during the mild morning hours, and run in Discharge Only Mode during the hottest part of the day. Custom control routines can be programmed using EMS to obtain a dynamic, supervisory control algorithm.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Off Mode. This mode is always present. Although the coil will not do any cooling, the state of the TES tank is still modeled since it can continue to exchange heat with the surrounding ambient air.
\item
  Cooling Only Mode. This mode is where the coil cools air at the evaporator using a model that is very similar to the regular, single speed DX cooling coil. The same five performance curves are used to describe cooling capacity and electric power use. The sensible heat ratio is described using two performance curves in the same as is available for 100\% outdoor air coils. The TES tank is neither charged or discharged but it continues to exchange heat with the surrounding ambient air.
\item
  Cooling And Charge Mode. This mode is where the coil both cools air at the evaporator and cools the TES tank at the same time. The model supports separate performance characteristics when there two separate heat engines, one for evaporator cooling and one for charging the TES tank.
\item
  Cooling and Discharge Mode. This mode is where the coil cools process air and heat is rejected to both the condenser section and the TES tank at the same time. The model supports separate performance characteristics when there two separate heat engines, one for evaporator cooling and one for TES cooling.
\item
  Charge Only Mode. This mode is where the coil charges the TES tank but does not provide any cooling at the process air cooling section.
\item
  Discharge Only Mode. This mode is where the coil cools process air by discharging the TES tank.
\end{itemize}

This cooling coil can be autosized. The cooling capacity for the cooling only mode is sized to meet the air system s final design cooling capacity. The cooling capacity for the other modes, and the storage capacity, can all be scaled relative to that one capacity using sizing factors that can be input by the user.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-35}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-34}

A unique name for this TES coil object, assigned by user.

\paragraph{Field: Availability Schedule Name}\label{field-availability-schedule-name-15}

The name of a schedule that determines whether the TES coil is available for cooling during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during a given time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that unit must be in off mode. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

\paragraph{Field: Operating Mode Control Method}\label{field-operating-mode-control-method}

This field determines how the TES coil is to be controlled in terms of which operating mode is in effect for a given time period. There are two choices, ScheduledModes or EMSControlled. Choosing ScheduledModes indicates that the operating mode is determined by the values in a schedule that is named in the following input field. Choosing EMSControlled indicates that the operating mode is determined by the state of an EMS actuator called Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage with the control type Operating Mode.

\paragraph{Field: Operation Mode Control Schedule Name}\label{field-operation-mode-control-schedule-name}

This field is used (and required) if the operating model control method is set to ScheduledModes in the previous input field. The control schedule consists of a series of integer values that indicate what mode the TES coil should operate in for a given time period. The values for various operating modes have been programmed to be as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item
  Off Mode
\item
  Cooling Only Mode
\item
  Cooling And Charge Mode
\item
  Cooling And Discharge Mode
\item
  Charge Only Mode
\item
  Discharge Only Mode
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Field: Storage Type}\label{field-storage-type}

This field is used to determine what type of material is used for thermal storage. There are two basic types of thermal storage material, fluid or ice. For fluid tanks, the material can be water or a user-defined fluid such as a glycol and the storage of thermal energy accompanies changes in the temperature of the fluid in the tank. For ice tanks, the material is water ice and the storage of thermal energy accompanies changes in the fraction of ice. This input field has three possible choices: \textbf{Water}, \textbf{UserDefinedFluidType}, Or \textbf{Ice}. Choose \textbf{Water} for a fluid tank TES based on water. Choose \textbf{UserDefinedFluidType} for a fluid tank TES based on custom or glycol type fluid. Choose \textbf{Ice} for ice-based TES tank.

\paragraph{Field: User Defined Fluid Type}\label{field-user-defined-fluid-type}

This field is used to declare what type of user defined fluid is contained in the TES tank. This input field is only used (and required) if the previous field is set to UserDefinedFluidType. Water, EthyleneGlycol, and PropyleneGlycol have fluid properties built-in to EnergyPlus. Using a FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration object allows specifying a mixture of water and a glycol and the name of one can be entered here. For other types of fluids, a complete set of fluid property data is needed, see FluidProperties:Name, FluidProperties:Temperature, etc.

\paragraph{Field: Fluid Storage Volume {[}m\(^{3}\){]}}\label{field-fluid-storage-volume-m3}

This field is used to describe the size of fluid-based TES tank, in m\(^{3}\). The storage volume can be automatically calculated based on the cooling capacity and sizing factor.

\paragraph{Field: Ice Storage Capacity {[}GJ{]}}\label{field-ice-storage-capacity-gj}

This field is used to describe the size of ice-based TES tank, in GJ. The storage capacity can be automatically calculated based on the cooling capacity and a sizing factor.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Capacity Sizing Factor {[}hr{]}}\label{field-storage-capacity-sizing-factor-hr}

This field is used if one of the previous two fields is set to autocalculate. The value entered here is a time duration, in hours. This time period is used for calculating a storage capacity. The basic idea is that storage be sized such that the TES can provide cooling at rated capacity for this amount of time. The rated capacity used in the sizing calculation is the Discharge Only Mode Rated Storage Discharging Capacity unless the Discharge Only mode is not available in which case it is the Cooling Only Mode Rated Total Evaporator Cooling Capacity. This sizing factor approach allows scaling the storage size relative to the TES coil s capacity. The sizing factor is applied for an ice-based TES by simply multiplying the rated capacity by the time duration (converted to seconds). For fluid-based TES, a change in fluid temperature of 10 °C is assumed to calculate the tank volume.

\paragraph{Field: Storage Tank Ambient Temperature Node Name}\label{field-storage-tank-ambient-temperature-node-name}

This is an overall UA value for the tank where the U-factor and surface area are combined into one coefficient. Heat loss or gain to the TES tank is modeled using \(\dot Q = {\left( {UA} \right)_{Tank}}\left( {{T_{TES}} - {T_{Amb}}} \right)\) . This field is required.

\paragraph{Field: Fluid Storage Tank Rating Temperature {[}C{]}}\label{field-fluid-storage-tank-rating-temperature-c}

This field is used to define what temperature is used for rating conditions when using a fluid storage tank. This field is only used for Storage Type of Water or UserDefinedFluidType.

This is the rated air flow rate through the evaporator (and any other air cooling devices that are in series with the main evaporator). The coil can be operated with a different flow rate than this rated flow rate and the performance of the unit scales accordingly using the curves that are of the type Function of Flow Fraction Curve. All of the other rated values for capacity, COP, and SHR values, for all the various modes, should be determined at the same air flow rate used here. This field can be autosized.

Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the rated SHR should be gross and not include supply fan heat. The packaged TES coil model uses SHR curves to modify the rated SHR as conditions move away from the rating conditions. This field is only used if Cooling Only Mode is available. If this input is left blank, the default is 0.7.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Only Mode Rated COP}\label{field-cooling-only-mode-rated-cop}

\subsection{Secondary Coils of DX System and Heat Pump}\label{secondary-coils-of-dx-system-and-heat-pump}

Secondary Coils reject to or remove heat from a secondary zone as part of a DX system or an air-to-air heat pump. Secondary coil refers to a condenser of a DX system or a heat pump in cooling operating mode or an evaporator of a heat pump in heating mode. The secondary coil (e.g.~condenser) of DX system or heat pumps is commonly installed outdoor but when installed inside a zone either heat is dumped to or extracted from a secondary zone. A secondary zone is a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil is installed. Secondary coils are not standalone DX coils but they are add-on features on existing DX coil objects. A secondary DX coil is modeled by specifying additional inputs in one of the following DX coil objects: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed, Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed, Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed, Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed, and Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed. These additional inputs allow us to model the heat rejected or extracted by the secondary coil while the primary (active) coil is serving another controlled zone as shown in \protect\hyperlink{SecondaryCoilsFigure1}{Figure}. A secondary coil is not controlled directly but responds to the requirements of the primary DX coil. Heat is rejected or extracted depending on the primary DX coil operating modes. For instance, heat rejected to a secondary zone by a condenser of a DX system or a heat pump is considered as sensible only whereas the energy extracted from a secondary zone may contain sensible and latent components.

Figure: Schematic of DX System and heat pump in cooling operating mode

Applications of this technology include: inter-zone heat pump in NTED (Dixon, 2010), and PTAC or PTHP serving Offices attached to a Warehouse, where the office partially or fully enclosed by the warehouse and the condenser is inside the Warehouse. Heat rejected or extracted by the secondary DX coil installed in a secondary zone is estimated from the DX coil models and it is considered as internal gains of the secondary zone. The capacity and electric power input of the DX system and heat pumps are determined from the operating modes of the primary cooling or heating DX coils. Calculation of a secondary coil tracks the operating modes of the primary DX coil serving the primary conditioned zone(s). Currently allowed DX coil models are single speed, two speed and multi speed DX Systems and Heat Pumps. To model secondary DX coils the condenser type should be AirCooled. There is no need to specify the condenser air inlet node. The model uses zone air node as the secondary coil air inlet node. And the fuel type in multispeed DX coils should Electricity.

\textbf{Cooling Operating Mode}: the primary DX cooling coil of a DX system serving a primary zone is active and heat is rejected by the secondary coil (condenser) into a secondary zone. The secondary zone name is specified in DX cooling coil objects. This operating mode applies to a DX cooling system and cooling operating mode of air-to-air single and multi-speed heat pumps. Heat rejected by a secondary coil (condenser) calculated at each time step becomes internal gain of the secondary zone as shown in \protect\hyperlink{SecondaryCoilsFigure2}{Figure}. Whenever a secondary zone name is specified in DX cooling coil objects, the secondary DX coil model calculation is invoked. The only input field required to invoke the secondary DX coil in cooling operating model is to add a zone name in the input field \emph{Zone Name for Condenser Placement} in the DX cooling coil object.

\subsubsection{Field: Zone Name for Condenser Placement}\label{field-zone-name-for-condenser-placement-3}

This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (condenser) of DX system or a heat pump is to be placed. This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to reject the condenser heat into this zone. The heat rejected is modeled as sensible internal gain of a secondary zone.

\textbf{Heating Operating Mode}: When a heat pump operates in heating mode then energy is extracted from the secondary zone. Total energy extracted from a secondary zone may contain sensible and latent components. The secondary coil (evaporator) model checks for the coil inlet and outlet air condition to determine if dehumidification has occurred. The sensible and latent split of the energy extracted is done using a user specified rated sensible heat ratio (SHR) and SHR modifier curves for temperature and secondary air flow fraction. If the coil operation is dry, then the SHR is set to 1.0. In addition, the model assumes that condensed water is drained to the outside. If defrosting operation is on, then the defrosting melts the frost and the liquid water from the collecting pan is drained to the outside. Thus, defrosting energy is not included in the zone energy balance. The six optioal input fields required in the DX heating coils are the following. The last five input fields are extensible depending on the speed of the heating DX coil:

\subsubsection{Field: Zone Name for Evaporator Placement}\label{field-zone-name-for-evaporator-placement-2}

This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (evaporator) of a heat pump is installed. This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to extract heat from the zone via secondary coil. Heat extracted is modeled as internal gain. If the primary DX system is a heat pump, then the zone name should be the same as the zone name specified for placing the secondary cooling DX coil.

\subsubsection{Field: Speed Secondary Coil Air Flow Rate}\label{field-speed-secondary-coil-air-flow-rate}

This input value is the secondary coil (evaporator) air flow rate when the heat pump is working in heating mode or the secondary coil (condenser) air flow rate when the heat pump is working in cooling mode. This input field is auto-sizable.

\subsubsection{Field: Speed Secondary Coil Fan Flow Scaling Factor}\label{field-speed-secondary-coil-fan-flow-scaling-factor}

This input field is scaling factor for autosizing the secondary DX coil fan flow rate. The secondary air flow rate is determined by multiplying the primary DX coil rated air flow rate by the fan flow scaling factor. Default value is 1.25. If the secondary coil fan flow rate is not autosized, then the secondary coil fan flow scaling factor is set to 1.0.

\subsubsection{Field: Speed Nominal Sensible Heat Ratio of Secondary Coil}\label{field-speed-nominal-sensible-heat-ratio-of-secondary-coil}

This input value is the nominal sensible heat ratio used to split the heat extracted by a secondary DX coil (evaporator) of a heat pump into sensible and latent components. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then pure sensible internal heat gain is assumed, i.e., sensible heat ratio of 1.0.

\subsubsection{Field: Speed Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-speed-sensible-heat-ratio-modifier-function-of-temperature-curve-name}

This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier biquadratic curve. The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary zone air node wet-bulb temperature and the heating DX coil entering air dry-bulb temperature. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then the nominal sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for temperature is set to 1.0.

\subsubsection{Field: Speed Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name}\label{field-speed-sensible-heat-ratio-modifier-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name}

This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier curve as function of secondary air flow fraction. The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary coil air flow fraction. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then the sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for flow fraction is set to 1.0.

\subsubsection{Secondary Coil Heat Rejection Rate {[}W{]}}\label{secondary-coil-heat-rejection-rate-w}

This is the sensible heat rejected to a zone by a secondary DX coil (condenser) in Watts. This is sum of the total cooling rate of a DX cooling coil and cooling electric power of the primary DX coil. This heat is applied as an internal gain to the secondary zone where the condenser is installed.

\subsubsection{Secondary Coil Total Heat Removal Rate {[}W{]}}\label{secondary-coil-total-heat-removal-rate-w}

This is the total energy removed from a a zone by a secondary DX coil (evaporator) in Watts. This is the total heating rate of the primary DX cooling coil minus the heating electric power of the primary DX coil. This heat is extracted from the secondary zone when the heat pump is operating in heating mode. The negative sign indicate that heat is removed from the zone.

\subsubsection{Secondary Coil Sensible Heat Removal Rate {[}W{]}}\label{secondary-coil-sensible-heat-removal-rate-w}

This is the sensible heat removed from a a zone by a secondary DX coil (evaporator) in Watts. This is determined by multiplying the total heat removed with sensible heat ratio of the secondary coil. This heat is extracted from the secondary zone when the heat pump is operating in heating mode. The negative sign indicate that sensible heat is removed from the zone.

\subsubsection{Secondary Coil Latent Heat Removal Rate {[}W{]}}\label{secondary-coil-latent-heat-removal-rate-w}

This is the latent heat removed from a a zone by a secondary DX coil (evaporator) in Watts. This is the difference between the total heat removal rate and the sensible heat remobal rate of the secondary coil. This heat is extracted from the secondary zone when the heat pump is operating in heating mode. The negative sign indicate that moisture is removed from the zone.

\subsubsection{Secondary Coil Sensible Heat Ratio {[]}}\label{secondary-coil-sensible-heat-ratio}

This is the operating sensible heat ratio the secondary DX coil (condenser) when the heat pump is operating in heating mode.

\subsubsection{Secondary Coil Compressor Part Load Ratio {[]}}\label{secondary-coil-compressor-part-load-ratio}

This is the compressor part load ratio when the heat pump is operating in heating mode and the secondary coil is extracting heat from a zone where the coil is installed. The secondary coil DX coil compressor part load ratio can be different from the primary DX coil compressor part load ratio in that the later may include the defrosting load.
