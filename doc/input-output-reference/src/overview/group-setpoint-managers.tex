\section{Group Setpoint Managers}\label{group-setpoint-managers}

Setpoint Managers are one of the high-level control constructs in EnergyPlus. A Setpoint Manager is able to access data from any of the HVAC system nodes and use this data to calculate a setpoint (usually a temperature setpoint) for one or more other HVAC system nodes. Setpoints are then used by Controllers or Plant or Condenser Loops as a goal for their control actions.

Setpoint Managers are executed at the start of each HVAC timestep, and they reside outside the HVAC system iteration loops. Thus, the Setpoint Managers are executed once per HVAC timestep, and they use previous timestep information (except for zone load) to calculate their setpoints.

The following situations require the use of a Setpoint Manager:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  any use of Controller:WaterCoil; either in Temperature control only or 2 Setpoint Managers for the " TemperatureAndHumidityRatio " control variable option.
\item
  use of Controller:OutdoorAir with \emph{Economizer Control Type} set to anything but \emph{NoEconomizer};
\item
  use of Coil:Heating:Fuel or Coil: Heating: Electric with the field \emph{Temperature Setpoint Node Name} set to a node name;
\item
  any use of CoilSystem:Cooling:DX;
\item
  any use of Humidifier:Steam:Electric.
\item
  Any use of PlantLoop or CondenserLoop which doesn't use an environment reference such as AIR or GROUND as a set point
\end{enumerate}

Setpoint managers will place a calculated or scheduled setpoint value on the setpoint node and overwrite any previous value. This value may represent one of several control types (e.g., Temperature, HumidityRatio, MassFlowRate, etc.). No two setpoint managers should use the same setpoint node for like control types.

For the case when two setpoint managers place a setpoint on the same setpoint node (e.g., a temperature setpoint placed on the same node by two different setpoint managers), the setpoint value on the node is calculated by the last setpoint manager simulated. Within a specific type of setpoint manager (e.g., Scheduled), the setpoint managers are simulated in the order found in the input data file (idf) when viewed using a text editor. It is also possible for two different types of setpoint managers to place setpoints of like control variable on the same node. In this case, the order of simulation for the type of setpoint manager determines which setpoint manager is the last to write a setpoint value to the node. This conflict in setpoint node data is most likely to cause inaccurate simulation results. For this reason, a conflicting setpoint node name warning message is issued so that the conflict can be resolved. Duplicate setpoint node names found within a specific node list will not typically cause problems with the simulation (the same value is written twice to the same node). In this case a duplicate setpoint node name warning is issued, however, this could be an error in the spelling of the node name and should be corrected.

\subsection{SetpointManager:Scheduled}\label{setpointmanagerscheduled}

The simplest Setpoint Manager simply uses a schedule to determine one or more setpoints. No node data is used as input. The input consists of the Setpoint Manager name, the control variable, the schedule name, and the name of a node list. The node list contains the name of those nodes at which the setpoint is to be applied. Of course, a node list name can always be simply the name of a single node.

Note that although this object provides a very general method of setting the values of many different control variables on nodes, the component models and system solvers may or may not be able to use them. Therefore, it is important to understand that simply setting a control variable using this object will not necessarily always produce the desired behavior.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-043}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-042}

A unique, user-assigned name for an instance of a scheduled setpoint manager. Anywhere in the input that this setpoint manager is used, it is referred to by this name.

\paragraph{Field: Control Variable}\label{field-control-variable-000}

The type of variable that will be controlled. There are several choices for this type of set point manager. The most common control variable is Temperature but other major choices include: HumidityRatio and MassFlowRate. The versatility of control variables available here (probably) exceeds what is actually available in the component and systems models. However, a large number of possible control variables are made available here for maximum flexibility and because some (but not all) component models will be able to use them. The complete list of key words and the units required in the associated schedules follow.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Temperature Temperture of fluid at node ( °C)
\item
  MaximumTemperature Maximum temperature of fluid at node ( °C)
\item
  MinimumTemperature Minimum temperature of fluid at node ( °C)
\item
  HumidityRatio Humidity ratio of fluid at node (kgWater/kgDryAir)
\item

\subsection{SetpointManager:OutdoorAirReset}\label{setpointmanageroutdoorairreset}

The Outdoor Air Reset Setpoint Manager is used to place a setpoint temperature on a system node according to the outdoor air temperature using a reset rule. The reset rule is determined by 2 points: the setpoint temperature at the outdoor air high temperature (TSetAtOAHigh) and the setpoint temperature at the outdoor air low temperature (TSetAtOALow). If the outdoor air temperature is above the outdoor air high temperature limit, the setpoint temperature is set to TSetAtOAHigh. If the outdoor air temperature is below the outdoor air low temperature limit, the setpoint temperature is set to TSetAtOALow. If the outdoor air temperature is between the outdoor air high and outdoor air low temperatures limits, the setpoint temperature is linearly interpolated between TSetAtOAHigh and TSetAtOALow. The outdoor air temperature is obtained from the weather information during the simulation. This setpoint manager can be used to place a setpoint temperature on air loop and plant loop system nodes.

The input consists of the setpoint manager name, the type of control variable, a node list name of the nodes affected by the setpoint, and the data for the reset rule: the setpoint temperature at the outdoor air low temperature, the outdoor air low temperature limit, the setpoint temperature at the outdoor air high temperature, and the outdoor air high temperature limit.

\subsection{SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Minimum}\label{setpointmanagersinglezonehumidityminimum}

The Single Zone Minimum Humidity Setpoint Manager allows the control of a single zone minimum humidity level. This setpoint manager detects the humidity level in a control zone and, using air and moisture mass balance, calculates the supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity at or above a given setpoint. The calculated supply air humidity ratio is then used as the setpoint for the designated setpoint node. A humidifier component placed upstream of the setpoint node can then use the humidity ratio setpoint to control its moisture addition rate.

The use of this object requires that a ZoneControl:Humidistat object be specified with a humidifying relative humidity schedule for the controlling zone. The humidistat s controlling zone must correspond with the control zone air node name specified in this setpoint manager.

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum}\label{setpointmanagersinglezonehumiditymaximum}

The Single Zone Maximum Humidity Setpoint Manager allows the control of a single zone maximum humidity level. This setpoint manager, used in conjunction with object ZoneControl:Humidistat, detects the air humidity level in a single control zone and uses air/moisture mass balances to calculate the supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity at or below a given setpoint. The calculated supply air humidity ratio is then used as the setpoint for the designated setpoint node. A dehumidification component placed upstream of this node can then use the humidity ratio setpoint to control its moisture removal rate (e.g., desiccant dehumidifiers).

In the case of a chilled water coil which is used for both temperature and high humidity control, this setpoint manager works in conjunction with a Controller:WaterCoil object to determine the minimum supply air temperature required to meet both the temperature (sensible) and humidity (latent) load in the control zone. See object Controller:WaterCoil in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for a detailed discussion of how this is achieved.

The use of this object requires that a ZoneControl:Humidistat object be specified with a relative humidity setpoint schedule for the controlling zone. The humidistat s controlling zone must correspond with the control zone air node name specified in this setpoint manager..

\subsection{SetpointManager:MixedAir}\label{setpointmanagermixedair}

The Mixed Air Setpoint Manager is meant to be used in conjunction with a Controller:OutdoorAir object. This setpoint manager is used to establish a temperature setpoint at the mixed air node. The Controller:OutdoorAir then operates the outdoor air damper to attempt to meet this setpoint.

In EnergyPlus the relief and outdoor air dampers, the economizer, and any outdoor air conditioning equipment form a separate subsystem of an air loop system (ref. AirLoopHVAC). The outdoor air controller operates within the subsystem. Consequently the mixed air temperature setpoint must take into account any downstream system fan heat if it is to meet a desired system supply air leaving temperature. The Mixed Air Setpoint Manager accomplishes this by referencing a supply air setpoint set by another setpoint manager (most likely at the AirLoopHVAC outlet node). The supply fan inlet and outlet nodes are also inputs to the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager. From this information the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager calculates the supply fan air temperature rise, subtracts it from the reference setpoint temperature, and sets the result as the mixed air node setpoint temperature.

Of course any type of setpoint manager can be used to establish a temperature setpoint at the mixed air node. But the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager is likely to be the most useful.

When optional inputs of Cooling Coil Inlet Node Name, Cooling coil Outlet Node Name, and Minimum Temperature at Cooling Coil Outlet Node are provided, the setpoint temperature at the mixed air node is calculated based on the maximum of both the reference setpoint temperature and minimum cooling coil outlet temperature, minus the cooling coil air temperature reduction and the supply fan air temperature rise if the supply fan placement is blow through. The setpoint temperature at the mixed air node is used to calculate the maximum outdoor air flow fraction in the corresponding Controller:OutdoorAir object. The outdoor air flow fraction is capped at the maximum outdoor air flow fraction to prevent the cooling coil from freezing, even though the fraction is below the minimum outdoor air flow fraction.

\subsection{SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat}\label{setpointmanageroutdoorairpretreat}

The OutdoorAir Pretreat Setpoint Manager is meant to be used in conjunction with an OutdoorAir:Mixer object. The Outdoor air Pretreat Setpoint Manager is used to establish a temperature or humidity ratio setpoint in the outdoor air stream flowing into the ``Outdoor Air Stream Node'' of an OutdoorAir:Mixer object. This setpoint manager determines the required setpoint in the outdoor air stream to produce the reference setpoint in the mixed air stream after mixing with return air. For example, if the temperature setpoint at the mixed air node is 15 °C, the return air temperature is 20 °C, and the outdoor air flow fraction is 0.5, the Outdoor Air Pretreat setpoint would be set to 10 °C.

Of course any type of setpoint manager can be used to establish setpoints in the outdoor air stream, but this setpoint manager is likely to be the most useful for systems which precondition outdoor air with equipment such as a DX cooling coil or desiccant dehumidifier.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-9-020}

\item
  MaximumHumidityRatio references and sets the ``System Node Humidity Ratio Max'' property. This type of reference setpoint may be set using SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum, SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average, or SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum and is used by equipment such as Controller:WaterCoil (with control variable TemperatureAndHumidityRatio ) and Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans.
\item

\subsection{SetpointManager:Warmest}\label{setpointmanagerwarmest}

The Warmest Setpoint Manager resets the cooling supply air temperature of a central forced air HVAC system according to the cooling demand of the warmest zone. For each zone in the system at each system timestep, the manager calculates a supply air temperature that will meet the zone cooling load at the maximum zone supply air flow rate. The lowest of the possible supply air temperatures becomes the new supply air temperature setpoint, subject to minimum and maximum supply air temperature constraints. The resulting temperature setpoint is the highest supply air temperature that will meet the cooling requirements of all the zones. When compared to a fixed cooling supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy minimizes zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption (if the chilled water temperature is also reset) at the cost of possible increased fan energy.

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Setpoint Temperature}\label{field-maximum-setpoint-temperature-1}

\subsection{SetpointManager:Coldest}\label{setpointmanagercoldest}

The Coldest Setpoint Manager is used in dual duct systems to reset the setpoint temperature of the air in the heating supply duct or in single duct systems to reset the setpoint temperature of the air for central heating coils. Usually it is used in conjunction with a SetpointManager:Warmest resetting the temperature of the air in the cooling supply duct. For each zone in the system at each system timestep, the manager calculates a supply air temperature that will meet the zone heating load at the maximum zone supply air flow rate. The highest of the possible supply air temperatures becomes the new supply air temperature setpoint, subject to minimum and maximum supply air temperature constraints. The resulting temperature setpoint is the lowest supply air temperature that will meet the heating requirements of all the zones. When compared to a fixed heating supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy minimizes central boiler energy consumption (if the hot water temperature is also reset or there are variable speed pumps) at the cost of possible increased fan energy (if there is variable volume control in the air system).

\subsection{SetpointManager:ReturnAirBypassFlow}\label{setpointmanagerreturnairbypassflow}

This manager is user in conjunction with a return air bypass configuration. This type of air system is basically a standard single duct system with the addition of a bypass duct that bypasses return air around the main system components in particular, the central cooling coil. This allows the central cooling coil to sufficiently dehumidify the mixed air; the bypassed air is then added to the supply air stream to bring the supply air temperature up to the desired temperature set point. This scheme is very useful in situations where an higher than normal supply air temperature is used for instance, in underfloor air distribution systems.

This manager relies on the program to figure out the system configuration and to extract the needed data from the system nodes. All the user needs to input is the name of the air system and a schedule giving the desired supply air temperature setpoint. No node names are required. The manager will establish a bypass air flow rate that upon mixing with the non-bypassed air will yield the temperature given in the schedule.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-12-016}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-12-010}

\subsection{SetpointManager:WarmestTemperatureFlow}\label{setpointmanagerwarmesttemperatureflow}

The Warmest Temperature Flow Setpoint Manager resets the cooling supply air temperature of a central forced air HVAC system according to the cooling demand of the warmest zone. The user can select one of two strategies: \emph{TemperatureFirst} or \emph{FlowFirst}.

For \emph{TemperatureFirst} the manager tries to find the highest setpoint temperature that will satisfy all the zone cooling loads at minimum supply air flow rate. If this setpoint temperature is less than the minimum, the setpoint temperature is set to the minimum, and the supply air flow rate is increased to meet the loads.

For \emph{FlowFirst} the manager tries to find the lowest supply air flow rate that will satisfy all the zone cooling loads at the maximum setpoint temperature. If this flow is greater than the maximum, the flow is set to the maximum and the setpoint temperature is reduced to satisfy the cooling loads.

When compared to a fixed cooling supply air temperature setpoint, the \emph{TemperatureFirst} strategy minimizes fan energy at the cost of possible increased zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption, whereas the \emph{FlowFirst} strategy minimizes zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption at the cost of possible increased fan energy.

\subsection{SetpointManager:MultiZone:Cooling:Average}\label{setpointmanagermultizonecoolingaverage}

This setpoint manager is used to establish a supply air temperature setpoint for a central forced air HVAC system (air loop) based on the predicted sensible cooling loads and actual supply air mass flow rates for all zones served by the system. For all controlled zones in the air loop (i.e., zones with a thermostat object), the setpoint manager calculates an average supply air temperature that will meet the zone cooling loads based on the actual zone supply air mass flow rates (lagged by one time step). The calculated setpoint temperature is subject to the minimum and maximum setpoint temperature constraints specified by the user. When compared to a fixed cooling supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy may reduce zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption (if the chilled water temperature is also reset) at the cost of possible increased fan energy.

\subsection{SetpointManager:MultiZone:Heating:Average}\label{setpointmanagermultizoneheatingaverage}

This setpoint manager is used to establish a supply air temperature setpoint for a central forced air HVAC system (air loop) based on the predicted sensible heating loads and actual supply air mass flow rates for all zones served by the system. For all controlled zones in the air loop (i.e., zones with a thermostat object), the setpoint manager calculates an average supply air temperature that will meet the zone heating loads based on the actual zone supply air mass flow rates (lagged by one time step). The calculated setpoint temperature is subject to the minimum and maximum setpoint temperature constraints specified by the user. When compared to a fixed heating supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy may reduce central boiler energy consumption (if the hot water temperature is also reset or there are variable speed pumps) at the cost of possible increased fan energy (if there is variable volume control for the air system).

\subsection{SetpointManager:MultiZone:MinimumHumidity:Average}\label{setpointmanagermultizoneminimumhumidityaverage}

This setpoint manager allows for controlling the minimum humidity level is multiple zones served by a central forced air HVAC system (air loop). This setpoint manager, used in conjunction with one or more ZoneControl:Humidistat objects, detects the air humidity level in multiple controlled zones served by the HVAC air loop and uses air/moisture mass balances to calculate an average supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity levels near their respective humidifying setpoints.

\subsection{SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average}\label{setpointmanagermultizonemaximumhumidityaverage}

This setpoint manager allows for controlling the maximum humidity level is multiple zones served by a central forced air HVAC system (air loop). This setpoint manager, used in conjunction with one or more ZoneControl:Humidistat objects, detects the air humidity level in multiple controlled zones served by the HVAC air loop and uses air/moisture mass balances to calculate an average supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity levels near their respective dehumidifying setpoints.

\subsection{SetpointManager:CondenserEnteringReset}\label{setpointmanagercondenserenteringreset}

The object resets the condenser entering water temperature setpoint to the optimal setpoint temperature that will result in minimum net energy consumption for the chiller and cooling tower plant. This chiller-tower optimization scheme uses one curve to determine the optimum condenser entering water temperature for a given time step and two other curves to place limit conditions on the optimized setpoint value. Note that this object will work with only one cooling tower object in a plant loop.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-23-004}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-23-002}

A unique, user assigned name for an instance of the optimized condenser entering water setpoint manager. Anywhere in the input that this setpoint manager is used, it is referred to by this name.

\paragraph{Field: Control variable}\label{field-control-variable-17}

The type of variable that will be controlled. The only valid choice for this setpoint manager is \textbf{Temperature}.

\paragraph{Field: Default Condenser Entering Water Temperature Schedule Name}\label{field-default-condenser-entering-water-temperature-schedule-name}

This schedule should define the default condenser entering water temperature setpoint. This scheduled setpoint value is only used in a given time step if the optimized setpoint value (see the Optimized Condenser Entering Water Temperature Curve Name field) does not fall within its prescribed boundary conditions.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Design Wetbulb Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-minimum-design-wetbulb-temperature-curve-name}

The curve name associated with the coefficients in the equation used to determine the minimum design tower wetbulb referenced by the minimum outside air wetbulb temperature curve below. The value from this curve is compared to the tower design wet bulb each timestep to establish one of the governing boundaries over the optimized condenser entering water temperature setpoint calculation. This curve must be quad-linear (Curve:QuadLinear) and is defined as:

\begin{equation}
T = {C_1} + {C_2}\cdot OaWb + {C_3}\cdot WPLR + {C_4}TwrWb + {C_5}NF
\end{equation}

where,

OaWb = Outside air wet bulb for current timestep, ˚C

WPLR = Weighted Part Load Ratio, dimensionless

TwrWb = Design tower wet bulb boundary condition, ˚C

NF = Normalized condenser water flow per unit of tower capacity, m3/s-W

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Outside Air Wetbulb Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-minimum-outside-air-wetbulb-temperature-curve-name}

The curve name associated with the coefficients in the equation used to determine the minimum actual wetbulb referenced by the optimized condenser entering water temperature curve. The value from this curve is compared the actual outside wet bulb each timestep to establish one of the governing boundaries over the optimized condenser entering water temperature setpoint calculation. This curve must be quad-linear (Curve:QuadLinear) and is defined as:

\begin{equation}
T = {C_1} + {C_2}\cdot MinWb + {C_3}\cdot WPLR + {C_4}\cdot TwrWb + {C_5}NF
\end{equation}

Where

MinWb = Minimum design wetbulb for current timestep, ˚C

NF = Normalized condenser water flow per unit of tower capacity, m3/s-W

\paragraph{Field: Optimized Condenser Entering Temperature Curve Name}\label{field-optimized-condenser-entering-temperature-curve-name}

The curve name associated with the coefficients in the optimized condenser entering water temperature equation. The value from this curve is used to calculate the optimized condenser entering water temperature for each timestep. If this optimized setpoint does not fall within the bounds established by the two boundary conditions, then the value from the Default Condenser Entering Water Temperature Schedule is used for the Condenser Entering Water Setpoint for that timestep. This curve must be quad-linear (Curve:QuadLinear) and is defined as:

\begin{equation}
T = {C_1} + {C_2}OaWb + {C_3}WPLR + {C_4}TwrWb + {C_5}NF
\end{equation}

where,

OaWb = Outside air wet bulb for current timestep, ˚C

WPLR = Weighted Part Load Ratio, dimensionless

TwrWb = Design tower wet bulb boundary condition, ˚C

NF = Normalized condenser water flow per unit of tower capacity, m3/s-W

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Lift}\label{field-minimum-lift}

This field establishes the minimum Lift allowed. Lift is generally thought of as the difference between condenser refrigerant pressure and the evaporator refrigerant pressure. Using defined pressure and temperature relationships, lift also can be related to the difference between the leaving chilled water and the leaving condenser water temperature. Further, when the leaving condenser water temperature and condenser water flow are constant, the entering condenser temperature can be used as a proxy for lift. Because most condenser water systems are designed for constant flow, entering condenser temperature is the most common metric for lift, and that is what meant here. If the calculated Condenser Entering Water Setpoint falls below (TEvapLvgWater+ MinimumLift), then the Condenser Entering Water Setpoint is reset to equal TEvapLvgWater+ MinimumLift. The units for this field are deg C TD. Default is 11.1 ˚C (20 F).

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Condenser Entering Temperature}\label{field-maximum-condenser-entering-temperature}

This field establishes the maximum condenser entering water setpoint temperature allowed. If the scheduled or calculated setpoint is above TCondEntMax, then TCondEntSetpoint is reset to equal TCondEntMax. The units for this field are deg C.

\paragraph{Field: Cooling Tower Design Inlet Air Wet-Bulb Temperature}\label{field-cooling-tower-design-inlet-air-wet-bulb-temperature}

This field defines the reference wet bulb temperature used to size the cooling tower. Typically, the design condenser entering water temperature equals TwrRefOaWb + TowerApproachTD. The units for this field are deg C.

\paragraph{Field: Setpoint Node or Node List Name}\label{field-setpoint-node-or-node-list-name}

This field defines the condenser node being controlled.

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{SetpointManager:CondenserEnteringReset:Ideal}\label{setpointmanagercondenserenteringresetideal}

The object determines a near-optimal condenser water entering setpoint at each time step that will result in minimum net energy consumption for the chiller and coolingtower plant. The ideal chiller-tower optimization scheme uses a search algorithm to find the ideal optimal setpoint at a given timestep. Note that this object will work with only one chiller object and only one cooling tower object in a plant loop.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-24-002}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-24-001}

A unique, user assigned name for an instance of the optimized condenser entering water setpoint manager. Anywhere in the input that this setpoint manager is used, it is referred to by this name.

\paragraph{Field: Control variable}\label{field-control-variable-18}

The type of variable that will be controlled. There is only one choice for this type of setpoint manager: \textbf{Temperature}.

\paragraph{Field: Minimum Lift}\label{field-minimum-lift-1}

This field establishes the minimum lift allowed. Lift is generally thought of as the difference between condenser refrigerant pressure and the evaporator refrigerant pressure. Using defined pressure and temperature relationships, lift also can be related to the difference between the leaving chilled water and the leaving condenser water temperature. Further, when the leaving condenser water temperature and condenser water flow are constant, the entering condenser temperature can be used as a proxy for lift. Because most condenser water systems are designed for constant flow, entering condenser temperature is the most common metric for lift, and that is what meant here. If the optimized condenser entering water setpoint falls below leaving evaporator water temperature plus minimum lift, then the condenser entering water setpoint is reset to equal this field value plus leaving evaporator water temperature. This determines the minimum boundary of condenser entering water setpoint. The unit for this field is deg C TD. Default is 11.1 deg C (20 deg F).

\paragraph{Field: Maximum Condenser Entering Water Temperature}\label{field-maximum-condenser-entering-water-temperature}

This field establishes the maximum condenser entering water setpoint temperature allowed. If the optimized condenser entering water setpoint is above this field value, then the condenser entering water setpoint is reset to equal this filed value. The units for this field are deg C. Default is 34 deg C

\paragraph{Field: Setpoint Node or Node List Name}\label{field-setpoint-node-or-node-list-name-1}

\subsection{SetpointManager:SingleZone:OneStageCooling}\label{setpointmanagersinglezoneonestagecooling}

The singe-zone, one-stage cooling setpoint manager allows a component to be controlled based on thermostatic control using the object ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint. This setpoint manager differs from other parts of EnergyPlus that control based on predicted loads to setpoint. This setpoint manager allows modeling on/off cycling of DX coils using CoilSystem:Cooling:DX in continuous fan air handlers. This setpoint manger detects if the zone is calling for a cooling stage and applies one setpoint value if cooling is called for and another setpoint value if cooling is not called for.

This method of control is much more like real world thermostatic control but it requires short zone timesteps. Models using this type of control should use 60 timesteps per hour and will run much slower because of that.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-25-002}

This setpoint manager differs from other parts of EnergyPlus that control based on predicted loads to setpoint. This setpoint manager allows modeling on/off cycling of heating coils in continuous fan air handlers. This setpoint manger detects if the zone is calling for a heating stage and applies one setpoint value if heating is called for and another setpoint value if heating is not called for.

This method of control is much more like real world thermostatic control but it requires short zone timesteps. Models using this type of control should use 60 timesteps per hour and will run much slower because of that.

\subsection{SetpointManager:ReturnTemperature:ChilledWater}\label{setpointmanagerreturntemperaturechilledwater}

This setpoint manager allows for the central plant simulation in EnergyPlus to target a specific return water temperature entering the plant supply equipment. This setpoint manager is specifically for ``chilled water'' (although it could be any fluid) applications. This setpoint manager senses the current supply and return temperatures, calculates the current demand on the loop, and assuming this load remains constant for this time step, it predicts what set-point temperature would provide the desired target return temperature.

Because this is predictive, and the setpoint is only updated once per system timestep (frequency of the call to ManageSetPoints), the longer the time step, the less accurate the prediction will be. To make tighter control, the time step can be reduced down even to one minute. However, as described in the EngineeringReference, for most realistic building profiles the control works quite well under normal timestep size. If your load profile is highly jagged with step changes in demand, a smaller timestep could help achieve tight control.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-26-001}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-27-001}

This alpha field is a unique, user-assigned name for an instance of a chilled water return temperature reset setpoint manager.

\paragraph{Plant Loop Supply Outlet Node}\label{plant-loop-supply-outlet-node}

This alpha field is the name of the plant loop supply side outlet node for the plant being managed by this setpoint manager. The current temperature of this node is sensed in order to calculate current loop demand. This node is typically also where the plant loop setpoint is specified, but not necessarily. This setpoint manager looks up the actual setpoint node from the PlantLoop internal data structures as it is specified on the PlantLoop object. If the plant loop setpoint is on a different node than the supply outlet node, the loop may not maintain return temperature control as expected.

\paragraph{Plant Loop Supply Inlet Node}\label{plant-loop-supply-inlet-node}

This alpha field is the name of the plant loop supply side inlet node whose temperature is controlled using this setpoint manager by resetting the supply setpoint temperature. The current temperature of this node is also sensed in order to calculate current loop demand.

\paragraph{Minimum Supply Temperature Setpoint}\label{minimum-supply-temperature-setpoint}

This numeric field plays multiple roles. During initialization, such as before the plant data structures are fully established, this is used as the default plant supply setpoint temperature. During normal calculation, this is used as the minimum chilled water supply temperature to avoid resetting the setpoint too low. During times of no-load, or odd conditions such as a negative load, the setpoint is reset to this design setpoint.

\paragraph{Maximum Supply Temperature Setpoint}\label{maximum-supply-temperature-setpoint}

This numeric field is the maximum value to which the supply setpoint can be reset. This ensures that the chilled water temperature does not go too high during reset operations.

\paragraph{Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type}\label{return-temperature-setpoint-input-type}

This alpha field must be one of three strings: ``Constant'', ``Scheduled'', or ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint''. If the choice is ``Constant'', the constant value in the next field is used as the target return temperature. If the choice is ``Scheduled'', the current value of the schedule named in the following field is used as the target return temperature. If the choice is ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint'', the actual setpoint temperature on the ``Plant Loop Supply Inlet Node'' specified above is retrieved and used as the target return temperature. This is convenient as a separate setpoint manager could be established to pre-calculate the desired return temperature, and will assign the Setpoint internally. Then when this return temperature manager executes, the setpoint will be updated and utilized.

\paragraph{Return Temperature Setpoint Constant Value}\label{return-temperature-setpoint-constant-value}

If the ``Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type'' field is ``constant'', the numeric value entered here is used as the target return temperature throughout the simulation.

\paragraph{Return Temperature Setpoint Schedule Name}\label{return-temperature-setpoint-schedule-name}

If the ``Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type'' field is ``scheduled'', this alpha field defines the name of a user-defined schedule storing values of return target temperature. The ``current'' value is looked up throughout the simulation. This is especially useful as EMS can be employed to do additional sensing and override the schedule value in a given timestep to a new dynamically-calculated return temperature.

An example idf input for a constant return reset setpoint manager is shown here:

\begin{lstlisting}

SetpointManager:ReturnTemperature:ChilledWater,
  Main Loop Setpoint Manager, !- Name
  Supply Outlet Node,      !- Plant Loop Supply Outlet Node

  ;                        !- Return Temperature Setpoint Schedule Name
\end{lstlisting}

Another example which uses the ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint'' is shown here with the accompanying setpoint being used to set the setpoint on the return node:

\subsection{SetpointManager:ReturnTemperature:HotWater}\label{setpointmanagerreturntemperaturehotwater}

This setpoint manager allows for the central plant simulation in EnergyPlus to target a specific return water temperature entering the plant supply equipment. This setpoint manager is specifically for ``hot water'' (although it could be any fluid) applications. This setpoint manager senses the current supply and return temperatures, calculates the current demand on the loop, and assuming this load remains constant for this time step, it predicts what supply set-point temperature would provide the desired target return temperature.

Because this is predictive, and the setpoint is only updated once per system timestep (frequency of the call to ManageSetPoints), the longer the time step, the less accurate the prediction will be. To make tighter control, the time step can be reduced down even to one minute. However, as described in the EngineeringReference, for most realistic building profiles the control works quite well under normal timestep size. If your load profile is highly jagged with step changes in demand, a smaller timestep could help achieve tight control.

\paragraph{Minimum Supply Temperature Setpoint}\label{minimum-supply-temperature-setpoint-1}

This numeric field is the minimum value to which the supply setpoint can be reset. This ensures that the hot water temperature does not go too low during reset operations.

\paragraph{Maximum Supply Temperature Setpoint}\label{maximum-supply-temperature-setpoint-1}

This numeric field plays multiple roles. During initialization, such as before the plant data structures are fully established, this is used as the default plant supply setpoint temperature.

During times of no-load, or odd conditions such as a negative load, the setpoint is reset to this design setpoint.

This alpha field must be one of three strings: ``Constant'', ``Scheduled'', or ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint''. If the choice is ``Constant'', the constant value in the next field is used as the target return temperature. If the choice is ``Scheduled'', the current value of the schedule named in the following field is used as the target return temperature. If the choice is ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint'', the actual setpoint temperature on the ``Plant Loop Supply Inlet Node'' specified above is retrieved and used as the target return temperature.
