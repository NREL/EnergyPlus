\chapter{Weather Data}\label{weather-data}

The description of the weather data format (a simple text-based format) is well described in the Auxiliary Programs document and won't be repeated here. Descriptions here will be pertinent to running the EnergyPlus program but you may wish to peruse the other descriptions as the statistics reports from the weather files may be useful during design and simulation.
