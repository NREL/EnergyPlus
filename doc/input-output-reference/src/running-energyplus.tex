\chapter{Running EnergyPlus}\label{running-energyplus}

EnergyPlus is written in C++, using many C++11 features. It runs as a console application on Windows, Mac, and Linux (tested on latest Ubuntu LTS). Details on running EnergyPlus are available in a separate document (Running EnergyPlus in Auxiliary Programs). The following files are needed to run EnergyPlus:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  EnergyPlus.exe (the executable file)
\item
  Energy+.ini (described below)
\item
  Energy+.idd (the input data dictionary file)
\item
  in.idf (the input file)
\item
  in.epw -- optional (weather data file)
\end{itemize}

The input data dictionary and input data file have been discussed in the previous sections of this document.

For weather simulations, EnergyPlus accepts EnergyPlus weather files. The actual file name is \textbf{in.epw}.

The usual release for Windows platform also includes a dependence on a shared library, EnergyPlusAPI.dll (.so on Linux).
