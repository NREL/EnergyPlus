\chapter{Input for Output}\label{input-for-output}

Several items are used to specify what will appear in the output file(s). The output is described in the next section of this document.

\section{Group -- Reports}\label{group-reports}

\subsection{Variable Dictionary Reports}\label{variable-dictionary-reports}

One of the most important outputs for EnergyPlus is the Variable Dictionary reports -- these contain the key variable names for each simulation. This single input object is used to produce two important reports that are used to identify the specific output variables and meters available for a specific EnergyPlus model.~ Two output files are produced (\textbf{eplusout.rdd \& eplusout.mdd}) that list the names of the output variables and meters for that simulation.~ You may need to run your simulation once and produce these files before you ask for specific output variables (\textbf{rdd}) or meters (\textbf{mdd}) (see \hyperref[outputvariable]{Output:Variable} and \hyperref[outputmeter-and-outputmetermeterfileonly]{Output:Meter} objects). Variables available, to some extent, depend on the simulation input. Variables are ``set up'' during the initial ``get input'' processing done within the modules. Therefore, an item that is specific to a certain type of coil would not be available if that coil were not used during the simulation. This command will produce a list of variables available for reporting.

\subsection{Output:VariableDictionary}\label{output-variabledictionary}

\subsubsection{Inputs}

\paragraph{Field: Key Field}\label{field-key-field}

For this field there are two choices: \textbf{IDF} and \textbf{regular}. The regular option is the default and produces a listing that shows the type of variable: Zone or HVAC, Average or Sum. ``\textbf{Zone}'' variables are calculated and can be reported after each Zone/Heat Balance timestep (ref: Timesteps input object). ``\textbf{HVAC}'' variables are calculated and can be reported with each variable HVAC timestep. ``\textbf{Average}'' variables will be averaged over the time interval being reported whereas ``\textbf{Sum}'' variables are summed over that time interval. (Meter variables are always summed.) Units for the variable are shown in ``{[}\}''.

\paragraph{Field: Sort Option}\label{field-sort-option}

For this field there are two choices: \textbf{Name} and \textbf{Unsorted}. By default, the listing of available reporting variables are unsorted -- listed in the streaming order that EnergyPlus generates them. Or, you can have them sorted by name.

Examples of the options for this object follow:

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:VariableDictionary,regular;
\end{lstlisting}

Results of this are shown in the Output Details document under the \textbf{eplusout.rdd} (output variables) and \textbf{eplusout.mdd} (meter variables) files.

The eplusout.mdd file has a similar format for meters:

\subsubsection{Variable Dictionary Report in IDF Format}\label{variable-dictionary-report-in-idf-format}

The common workflow process of examining Variable Dictionary Reports and then adding reporting requests to an IDF file can be facilitated by using the following alternate form (Report Name = IDF) of the input object that requests the reports.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:VariableDictionary, IDF;
\end{lstlisting}

A sorted request would appear similarly:

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:VariableDictionary, IDF, Name;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Surface Reports}\label{surface-reports}

There are two specific objects for surfaces: \textbf{\hyperref[outputsurfaceslist]{Output:Surfaces:List}} and \textbf{\hyperref[outputsurfacesdrawing]{Output:Surfaces:Drawing}} -- as the names imply, the list reports are simple text reports that are contained in one of the output files whereas the drawing reports will create files that are used in other graphic tools.

These objects and their use is described in the following:

\subsection{Output:Surfaces:List}\label{outputsurfaceslist}

Examples of using the Output:Surfaces:List object follow:

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-040}

\paragraph{Lines Data Report}\label{lines-data-report}

An example input object for this report follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:List, Lines;
\end{lstlisting}

The above IDF line will produce a simple file of line segments that constitute the surfaces in the IDF file. This file is the~ ``lines'' report (\textbf{eplusout.sln}) and is decribed in more detail in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{Field: Report Specifications}\label{field-report-specifications}

An extra option of entering ``IDF'' in this field directs the Lines report to produce coordinates transformed into Surface Geometry (Lower Left Corner, CounterClockwise, WorldCoordinates).~ An example of this follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:List, Lines, IDF;
\end{lstlisting}

The result is put on the \textbf{eplusout.sln} file and is nearly ready for putting into a IDF. Again, it is described in more detail in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{Detailed Surface Data Report}\label{detailed-surface-data-report}

An example input object for this report follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:List, Details;
\end{lstlisting}

This report (in \textbf{eplusout.eio}) contains details about each surface -- including surface name, associated zone, area, approximate height and width, tilt, outward facing angle. Specific details on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{Vertices Data Report}\label{vertices-data-report}

An example input object for this report follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:List, Vertices;
\end{lstlisting}

This report (in \textbf{eplusout.eio}) contains the vertices of each surface along with surface name and other information. Specific details on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{Detailed Surface Data With Vertices Report}\label{detailed-surface-data-with-vertices-report}

An example input object for this report follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:List, DetailsWithVertices;
\end{lstlisting}

This report (in \textbf{eplusout.eio}) is the combination of the two preceding reports (Details and Vertices). Specific details on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{View Factor Information Report}\label{view-factor-information-report}

An example input object for this report follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:List, ViewFactorInfo;
\end{lstlisting}

This report (in \textbf{eplusout.eio}) provides details about the thermal radiation exchange view factors and interchange factors.~ Specific details on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{DecayCurvesFromComponentLoadsSummary}\label{decaycurvesfromcomponentloadssummary}

An example input object for this report follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:List, DecayCurvesFromComponentLoadsSummary;
\end{lstlisting}

This report (in \textbf{eplusout.eio}) provides an intermediate calculation used, called a decay curve,~ in the Zone Component Loads Summary report for the estimate of the sensible-delayed column values. A decay curve is created for each surface in a zone by introducing a radiant pulse. Each value in each row of the report corresponds to a zone time step from the time the pulse was introduced. See Zone Component Load Summary described in object \hyperref[outputtablesummaryreports]{Output:Table:SummaryReports} for more detailed information.

\subsection{Output:Surfaces:Drawing}\label{outputsurfacesdrawing}

Examples of using the Output:Surfaces:Drawing object follow:

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1-037}

\paragraph{DXF Surface Report}\label{dxf-surface-report}

Examples input objects follow.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:Drawing, DXF;
  Output:Surfaces:Drawing, DXF, RegularPolyline;
  Output:Surfaces:Drawing, DXF, Triangulate3DFace, mycolorscheme;
\end{lstlisting}

The above IDF specification will produce a DXF file (\textbf{eplusout.dxf}) of the surfaces in the IDF file.~ Only one DXF report can be produced. More specifics on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{Field: Report Specifications 1}\label{field-report-specifications-1}

As indicated in the example, you can select among three different ways that surfaces with more than four sides will appear in the DXF file. These are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ThickPolyline -- surface with \textgreater{}4 sides will be represented as a ``thick'' line in the appropriate surface color. It will look like a hole in the drawing with a thicker edge.
\item
  RegularPolyline -- surface with \textgreater{}4 sides will be represented as a regular line in the appropriate surface color. It will look like a hole in the drawing.
\item
  Triangulate3DFace-- surface with \textgreater{}4 sides will be ``triangulated'' internally within EnergyPlus.~ This is only for drawing purposes and does not affect the calculations in any way.~ In a line version of the DXF, it will appear that the surface is split into triangles. In a solid view, the surface will appear similar to surfaces with \textless{} = 4 sides. The triangulation algorithm is not perfect and warnings do result when the software cannot triangulate the surface.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Report Specifications 2}\label{field-report-specifications-2}

This field can be used to control the color scheme in the DXF file by entering the name of an \hyperref[outputcontrolsurfacecolorscheme]{OutputControl:SurfaceColorScheme} object.~ Using \hyperref[outputcontrolsurfacecolorscheme]{OutputControl:SurfaceColorScheme}, you can define color schemes for surface representation. This feature will let you align the colors with the software of your choice (colors don't seem to be standard across DXF viewers).

Several software programs can render this file into something viewable and are described in more detail in the Output Details and Examples document under the file name (\textbf{eplusout.dxf}).

\paragraph{DXF Wire Frame Report}\label{dxf-wire-frame-report}

An example input object for this report follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:Drawing, DXF:WireFrame;
\end{lstlisting}

The above IDF specification will produce a DXF (Drawing Exchange Format) file (\textbf{eplusout.dxf}) of the surfaces in the IDF file using the DXF ``Lines'' command -- producing only a wire frame capable file. More specifics on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document. Only one DXF report can be produced.

\paragraph{VRML Report}\label{vrml-report}

Examples input objects for this report follow.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Surfaces:Drawing, VRML;
  Output:Surfaces:Drawing, VRML, Triangulate3DFace;
\end{lstlisting}

The above IDF specification produces a VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) file (\textbf{eplusout.wrl}) of the surfaces in the IDF file.~ Only one VRML report can be produced. VRML files can be viewed in many web browsers after adding a ``plug-in'' and there are some stand-alone viewers as well. More specifics on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{Field: Report Specifications 1}\label{field-report-specifications-1-1}

As indicated in the example, you can select several figure types (for \textgreater{}4 sided surfaces) in the DXF report. These are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ThickPolyline -- surface with \textgreater{}4 sides will be represented as a ``thick'' line in the appropriate surface color. It will look like a hole in the drawing with a thicker edge.
\item
  RegularPolyline -- surface with \textgreater{}4 sides will be represented as a regular line in the appropriate surface color. It will look like a hole in the drawing.
\item
  Triangulate3DFace -- surface with \textgreater{}4 sides will be ``triangulated'' internally within EnergyPlus.~ This is only for drawing purposes and does not affect the calculations in any way.~ In a line version of the VRML, it will appear that the surface is split into triangles. In a solid view, the surface will appear similar to surfaces with \textless{} = 4 sides. The triangulation algorithm is not perfect and warnings do result when the software cannot triangulate the surface.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Field: Report Specifications 2}\label{field-report-specifications-2-1}

Color schemes are not applicable for VRML reports.

\subsection{Output:Schedules}\label{outputschedules}

This is a condensed reporting that illustrates the full range of schedule values -- in the style of input: DaySchedule, WeekSchedule, and Annual Schedule.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-2-034}

\paragraph{Field: Key Field}\label{field-key-field-1}

This field should contain the word \textbf{Hourly} or \textbf{TimeStep} to obtain the respective reports.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Schedules, Hourly;     ! values on hourly increments (day schedule resolution)
  Output:Schedules, TimeStep; ! will give them at the timestep of the simulation
\end{lstlisting}

This report is placed on the \textbf{eplusout.eio} file. Details of this reporting are shown in the Output Details and Examples document.~ Schedule values over time can also be obtained in the EnergyPlus Standard Output (in eplusout.eso) using \hyperref[outputvariable]{Output:Variable} objects.

\subsection{Output:Constructions}\label{outputconstructions}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-3-030}

\paragraph{Constructions Report}\label{constructions-report}

This report content is added to the ``\textbf{eplusout.eio}'' file. It shows the calculated results related to conduction transfer functions for each construction. It also includes similar details about the windows. Specific details on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document.~ The following input object is used to obtain the Construction report.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Constructions,Constructions;
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Field: Details Type 1, Details Type 2}\label{field-details-type-1-details-type-2}

Either field can contain the word ``\textbf{Constructions}'' to get the constructions report.

Or either field can contain the word ``\textbf{Materials}'' to obtain the Materials report.

\paragraph{Materials Report}\label{materials-report}

This report content is added to the ``\textbf{eplusout.eio}'' file. It provides a summary of the thermal properties and thickness of the construction and window materials in the model.~ Specific details on this report can be found in the Output Details and Examples document.~ The following input object is used to obtain the Materials report.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Constructions,Materials;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Output:DaylightFactors}\label{outputdaylightfactors}

This report content is added to the \textbf{eplusout.dfs} file.

Daylight factors are ratios of interior illuminance at a specific location to exterior horizontal illuminance. In EnergyPlus, they are pre-calculated hourly for every shadow calculation day for every exterior window of a daylight zone. The pre-calculated daylight factors are interpolated between hours and for the actual sky conditions in the time-step calculation of the daylighting performance of daylight zones.

EnergyPlus reports the daylight factors for four CIE sky types (clear, turbid clear, intermediate, and overcast) at noon time (12:00pm) for each exterior windows (base window without shading) in the \textbf{eio} file when the daylight factors are first calculated. This new object can report all hourly pre-calculated daylight factors. Details of the report are shown in the Output Details document.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-4-027}

\paragraph{Field: Reporting Days}\label{field-reporting-days}

This field is used to select days to report the daylight factors. Two choices are ``\textbf{SizingDays}'' and ``\textbf{AllShadowCalculationDays}''. The ``\textbf{SizingDays}'' choice will output the daylight factors for only the sizing calculation days, while the ``\textbf{AllShadowCalculationDays}'' choice will output daylight factors for all shadow calculation days.

An example of this object follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:DaylightFactors,
  SizingDays;    !- Reporting Days
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Output:EnergyManagementSystem}\label{outputenergymanagementsystem}

This report content is added to the ``eplusout.edd'' file. It shows information useful for the Energy Management System. The user can select the level of detail reported to the file using the fields in this object. However, there must be some other EMS-related input objects in the input file before this report will be generated.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-5-024}

\paragraph{Field: Actuator Availability Dictionary Reporting}\label{field-actuator-availability-dictionary-reporting}

This field is used to control the level of output reporting related to the EMS actuators that are available for a particular model. When EnergyPlus runs with EMS, it sets up a wide array of possible actuators that the EMS could use. (To actually use them requires an \hyperref[energymanagementsystemactuator]{EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator} object). Actuator availability dictionary reporting is provided to show the user what actuators are available in a particular building model. Regardless of the level of reporting chosen here, the same set of actuators are actually available. There are three levels to choose from. The ``None'' choice means that no reporting of available actuators is done. The ``NotByUniqueKeyNames'' level means that the output includes only the types of actuators and their control options but not the unique, user-defined names that identify a specific actuator in the model. The ``Verbose'' level means that the output includes all combinations of actuator types, control types, and the unique names of specific actuators. The verbose level provides all the information needed for input in an \hyperref[energymanagementsystemactuator]{EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator} input object.

\paragraph{Field: Internal Variable Availability Dictionary Reporting}\label{field-internal-variable-availability-dictionary-reporting}

This field is used to control the level of output reporting related to the EMS internal variables that are available for a particular model. When EnergyPlus runs with EMS, it sets up a wide array of possible internal data sources that the EMS could use. (To actually use them requires an \hyperref[energymanagementsysteminternalvariable]{EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable} object). Internal variable availability dictionary reporting is provided to show the user what internal data are available. Regardless of the level of reporting chosen here, the same internal data are available. There are three levels to choose from. The ``None'' choice means that no reporting of available internal data is done. The ``NotByUniqueKeyNames'' level means that the output includes only the types of internal data but not the unique names that identify a specific instances in the model. The ``Verbose'' level means that the output includes all combinations of internal variables and the unique names of specific instances. The verbose level provides all the information needed for an \hyperref[energymanagementsysteminternalvariable]{EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable} input object.

\paragraph{Field: EnergyPlus Runtime Language Debug Output Level}\label{field-energyplus-runtime-language-debug-output-level}

This field is used to control the level of output reporting related to the execution of EnergyPlus Runtime Language, or Erl. This reporting is valuable for debugging Erl programs. When Erl programs are run inside EnergyPlus they can report error situations (such as divide by zero) or a full trace of each Erl statement. There are three levels of reporting. The ``None'' choice means that no reporting of Erl debug information is done. The ``ErrorsOnly'' choice means that Erl debugging traces are only output if the statement produces an error situation. The ``Verbose'' choice means that Erl debugging traces are done for each line of each Erl program. The verbose setting needs to be used with care because a large model with a long runperiod can easily create an EDD file that is too large for most computer systems (e.g.~many GBs of text).

An example of this object follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:EnergyManagementSystem,
  Verbose,    ! Actuator Availability Dictionary Reporting
  Verbose,    ! Internal Variable Availability Dictionary Reporting
  ErrorsOnly; ! EnergyPlus Runtime Language Debug Output Level
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{OutputControl:SurfaceColorScheme}\label{outputcontrolsurfacecolorscheme}

This object provides control over the colors that appear in the DXF report, by surface.~ In addition, the Datasets folder contains example objects, including the ``original'' color scheme (prior to the 2.1 release).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-6-021}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{field-name-039}

This assigns a unique name to this colorscheme data set.~ This name is used in the DXF output objects.

\paragraph{Field Set: Drawing Element Type and Colorr}\label{field-set-drawing-element-type-and-colorr}

This set of fields can range from none (accepting the default colors) up to 15 sets with individual types of building elements assigned a color number.~ (drawing element types not assigned a color number will use the default color numbers)

\paragraph{Field: Drawing Element \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Type}\label{field-drawing-element-type}

This field uses a choice of the drawing types (Text, Walls, Windows, GlassDoors, Doors, Roofs, Floors, DetachedBuildingShades, DetachedFixedShades, AttachedBuildingShades, Photovoltaics, TubularDaylightDomes, TubularDaylightDiffusers, DaylightReferencePoint1, DaylightReferencePoint2) for the color number assignment in the following field.

\paragraph{Field: Color for Drawing Element \textless{}\#\textgreater{}}\label{field-color-for-drawing-element}

This is a color ``number'' from 0 to 255.~ DXF display software is not standardized -- you may need to play around with these numbers if you don't like the supplied default color scheme.

\subsection{OutputControl:ReportingTolerances}\label{outputcontrolreportingtolerances}

This input object is created to allow more user control over some aspects of output reporting. Specifically, the reporting of ``Time setpoint not met'' hours~ See thermostat reporting (ZoneControl Thermostat Outputs).

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-7-021}

\paragraph{Field: Tolerance for Time Heating Setpoint Not Met}\label{field-tolerance-for-time-heating-setpoint-not-met}

This field allows the entry of a value for the tolerance away from the heating setpoint reporting. If the zone temperature is below the heating setpoint by more than this value, the following output variables will increment as appropriate

Zone Heating Setpoint Not Met Time

Zone Heating Setpoint Not Met While Occupied Time

This also impacts table report ``Annual Building Utility Performance Summary'' subtable ``Comfort and Setpoint Not Met Summary''.

\paragraph{Field: Tolerance for Time Cooling Setpoint Not Met}\label{field-tolerance-for-time-cooling-setpoint-not-met}

This field allows the entry of a value for the tolerance away from the cooling setpoint reporting. If the zone temperature is above the cooling setpoint by more than this value, the following output variables will increment as appropriate

Zone Cooling Setpoint Not Met Time

Zone Cooling Setpoint Not Met While Occupied Time

This also impacts table report ``Annual Building Utility Performance Summary'' subtable ``Comfort and Setpoint Not Met Summary''.

As seen in an IDF:

\begin{lstlisting}
OutputControl:ReportingTolerances,.21,.21;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Output:Variable}\label{outputvariable}

This input object is used request results reporting.~ As shown above in the Variable Dictionary Report section, there are many different output variables available for reporting results from EnergyPlus.~ The Output:Variable object is primarily used for reporting time series data at various frequencys.

Each Output:Variable object causes a specific number assignment for outputs. For example, you could request separate reporting for the outside temperature:

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Variable,*,Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature,timestep;
Output:Variable,*,Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature,hourly;
Output:Variable,*,Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature,monthly;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-8-019}

\paragraph{Field: Key Value}\label{field-key-value}

This alpha field can be used to make a specific reference for reporting. In addition to the generic variable names listed in the Variable Dictionary Report for the input file, variables will also have a key designator (such as Zone name or Surface name). You can reference the standard output file (\textbf{eplusout.eso}) to see just how these look.

\begin{lstlisting}
41,2,ZN001:WALL003,Surface Inside Temperature [C]
42,2,ZN001:WALL004,Surface Inside Temperature [C]
43,2,ZN002:WALL003,Surface Inside Temperature [C]
44,2,ZN002:WALL004,Surface Inside Temperature [C]
45,2,ZN001:WALL004,Surface Outside Temperature [C]
46,2,ZN001:WALL004,Surface Int Convection Coeff[W/m2-K]
47,2,ZN001:WALL004,Surface Ext Convection Coeff[W/m2-K]
48,2,ZONE ONE,Zone Mean Radiant Temperature [C]
49,2,ZONE ONE,Zone Total Internal Latent Gain Energy [J]
50,2,ZONE ONE,Zone Lights Electric Energy [J]
51,2,ZONE ONE,Zone Air Temperature [C]
\end{lstlisting}

For example, in the previous block, one key for the surface variables is \textbf{ZN001:WALL004} whereas the key for the zone variables is \textbf{ZONE ONE} (note that the space is required and significant for this key).

You can have all keys listed in the standard output file by putting a ``*'' in this field, you can have specific items listed by putting in a key value, or you can use regular expressions to filter the key values. If this field is left blank, it will use a * as the default (i.e., you will get all variables of Variable Name).

Using regular expressions allows for powerful filtering capabilities on the key value. For example, in the previous block, you can find the Surface Inside Temperature for all surfaces in only ZN001 with a single Output:Variable expression.

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Variable,ZN001:.*,Surface Inside Temperature,timestep;
\end{lstlisting}

Consult the following URL for more information about the regular expressions RE2 supports: \url{https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax}

Note that due to the functionality of the Input Processor, no regular expression can contain a ``,'' even if it is a valid regular expression. If a regular expression has a comma in it then the Input Processor will create a new, erroneous field. The most common occurrence of a comma in a regular expression is ranges, such as ``[a-zA-Z]\{3,5\}''.

\paragraph{Field: Variable Name}\label{field-variable-name}

This alpha field is the variable name (you don't have to put on the units) that is shown in the Variable Dictionary Report file (eplusout.rdd). This field is required.

\paragraph{Field: Reporting Frequency}\label{field-reporting-frequency}

This field specifies how often the variable will be listed in the output file. ``\textbf{Detailed}'' will list the value each calculation step (i.e.~Zone or HVAC). ``\textbf{Timestep}'' will be the same as ``Detailed'' for Zone valued variables and will be aggregated to the Zone timestep (i.e.~Timestep in Hour value) for HVAC variables. ``\textbf{Hourly}'' will aggregate the value to the hour. ``\textbf{Daily}'' will aggregate to the day (i.e.~one value per day). ``\textbf{Monthly}'' will aggregate to the month (i.e.~one value per month). ``\textbf{\hyperref[runperiod]{RunPeriod}}'' will aggregate to the runperiod specified (each Design Day is a runperiod as is each runperiod object). ``\textbf{Annual}'' will aggregate to the year  (i.e.~one value per year) when used with a RunPeriod:CustomRange object. Default for this field if left blank or omitted is \textbf{Hourly}.

\paragraph{Field: Schedule Name}\label{field-schedule-name-004}

The final field is a schedule name. This can be used to limit the number of lines that appear in your output file. For example, a schedule such as ``ON PEAK'' or ``OFF PEAK'' could provide a slice of values. Or, a seasonal schedule could be devised. The output variable will be active during any hour in which the schedule value is \textgreater{}0. For daily, monthly, and environment reporting frequencies, the aggregate value will be only for active schedule hours. Summed variables will report the sum for the active hours only. Averaged variables will report the average during the active hours only. If Schedule\_Name is omitted, the output variable will be active for all hours.

Other IDF examples:

\begin{lstlisting}
Output:Variable, * , Zone Mean Air Temperature, hourly;
Output:Variable, * , Zone Mean Radiant Temperature, timestep;
Output:Variable, * , Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy, hourly;
Output:Variable, * , Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Energy, hourly;
Output:Variable, * , Zone Air Temperature, hourly;
Output:Variable, * , Zone Air Temperature;  ! same as previous line
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Output:\-Meter and Output:\-Meter:\-Meter\-File\-Only}\label{outputmeter-and-outputmetermeterfileonly}

\subsection{Output:\-Meter:\-Cumulative and Output:\-Meter:\-Cumulative:\-Meter\-File\-Only}\label{outputmetercumulative-and-outputmetercumulativemeterfileonly}

Appropriate variables are grouped onto ``meters'' for reporting purposes.~ (The meters available are listed in the eplusout.mdd file, see Variable Dictionary Report section.) If the ``\hyperref[outputmeter-and-outputmetermeterfileonly]{Output:Meter}'' input object is used, these results written out to both the \textbf{eplusout.eso} and \textbf{eplusout.mtr} files. This allows easy graphing and comparison with ``normal'' values (such as Zone Temperature or Outdoor Temperature). If the ``\hyperref[outputmeter-and-outputmetermeterfileonly]{Output:Meter:MeterFileOnly}'' input object is used, then the values results written out to only the \textbf{eplusout.mtr} file. The \textbf{eplusout.mtr} file has the same structure as the \textbf{eplusout.eso} file. A companion file, the \textbf{eplusout.mtd} file, contains a detailed list and explanation of all meters for a given run and the component values that are accumulated on each meter.

The cumulative meter outputs (\hyperref[outputmetercumulative-and-outputmetercumulativemeterfileonly]{Output:Meter:Cumulative} and Output:\-Meter:\-Cumulative:\-Meter\-File\-Only) use the same meter names but the output is cumulative for the reporting (for each environment). That is, if the reporting frequency for the cumulative meter output is hourly, then hour 1 value will be that for hour 1, hour 2 value will be hour1 + hour2, etc. In other words, the end value for a cumulative meter reporting should be identical if you reported the value of the meter at the \hyperref[runperiod]{RunPeriod} frequency.

\subsubsection{Field: Name}\label{field-name-1-036}

Meter names applicable for the simulation are shown on the Variable Dictionary Report contained in the \textbf{eplusout.mdd} file described in the Output Details and Examples document.

Meter names are one of six forms:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textless{}ResourceType\textgreater{}:\textless{}GroupType\textgreater{}
\item
  \textless{}EndUseType\textgreater{}:\textless{}ResourceType\textgreater{}
\item
  \textless{}EndUseSubcategory\textgreater{}:\textless{}EndUseType\textgreater{}:\textless{}ResourceType\textgreater{}
\end{itemize}
The following forms apply only for GroupType = Zone or SpaceType:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textless{}ResourceType\textgreater{}:\textless{}GroupType\textgreater{}:\textless{}name\textgreater{}
\item
  \textless{}EndUseType\textgreater{}:\textless{}ResourceType\textgreater{}:\textless{}GroupType\textgreater{}:\textless{}name\textgreater{}
\item
  \textless{}EndUseSubcategory\textgreater{}:\textless{}EndUseType\textgreater{}:\textless{}ResourceType\textgreater{}:\textless{}GroupType\textgreater{}:\textless{}name\textgreater{}
\end{itemize}

The user requests reporting by either specifying the full name above (without Units) or a ``wildcard'' representation of that name (to obtain all meters of a type). For example, entering ``Electricity:*'' for the meter name will report on all the Electricity: meters (Electricity:Facility, Electricity:Building, Electricity:Zone:Resistive Zone, Electricity:Zone:East Zone, Electricity:North Zone in the example above). Both the resource types and end-use types are set within the program by the developers. End-use subcategories are user-defined and are an input field for certain objects.

To summarize the previous paragraph, you could use:

Facility meters contain all the energy of a fuel type. Building meters contain the sum of each zone's energy. Zone and SpaceType meters are overlapping components of the Building meters. HVAC meters contain the energy from the air and zone HVAC system components. Plant meters contain the energy from the plant equipment.

Thus, the following relationships should be observed:

\begin{equation}
Facility = \sum {\left( {Building + HVAC + Plant + Exterior} \right)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Building = \sum\limits_1^{NumberOfZones} {Zone} = \sum\limits_1^{NumberOfSpaceTypes} {SpaceType}
\end{equation}

There are also some special purpose meters used to describe electricity resource flows in greater detail.~ Electricity metering is tracked in more detail to accommodate the complexities of onsite electricity generation.~ There are three variations on the electricity resource type including:~ (1) ``ElectrictyPurchased'' which is the quantity of electricity purchased and is always positive, (2) ``ElectricitySold'' which is the quantity of electricity exported by the building, that which is typically ``sold'' back to the power company, and is always positive, and (3) ``ElectricityNet'' which is the net electricity demand considering all sources of onsite generation and demand and can be either positive or negative.

\subsubsection{Field: Reporting Frequency}\label{field-reporting-frequency-1}

Similar to the output variables, meters can be reported at different frequencies. Their resolution is the Zone Timestep interval (Number of Timesteps input). For this frequency, the elemental value of the meter will be reported. For more inclusive frequencies, the summed value along with the maximum and minimum values for the time interval will be reported. Default for this field if left blank or omitted is \textbf{Hourly}.

Examples of specifying the object in the IDF follow.

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Meter Details File (eplusout.mtd)}\label{meter-details-file-eplusout.mtd}

The meter details file illustrates what is on each meter and vice versa.~ It is described in the Output Details and Examples document under the file name.

\subsection{Output:EnvironmentalImpactFactors}\label{outputenvironmentalimpactfactors}

The Output:\hyperref[environmentalimpactfactors]{EnvironmentalImpactFactors} object triggers the necessary Facility meters to be reported and the Pollutants resulting from these on and off-site energy consumptions. These values are put into the eplusout.mtr file. Facility meters contain all the energy of a fuel type. Thus, the following relationships should be observed:

\begin{equation}
Facility = \sum {\left( {Building + System + Plant + Exterior} \right)}
\end{equation}

Information regarding how the coefficients are derived and applied can be found in the Engineering Document.

To turn on the reporting and the calculations for the environmental factors the user enters 3 objects:

\textbf{Output:EnvironmentalImpactFactors:} (with associated reporting frequency, more than one frequency can be requested)

\textbf{EnvironmentalImpactFactors:} (contains additional information necessary for the calculations not included in the Fuel Factors)

\textbf{FuelFactors:} (required for every fuel that is simulated and converted in this simulation input file)

Users will enter environmental impact factors for each Fuel Type or FuelFactor. This is the same for each Fuel Type: Natural Gas, Residual Oil, Distillate Oil, Coal, Off-Site Electricity, Gasoline, and Propane. For District Heating, District Cooling, and Steam there are additional fields in the \hyperref[environmentalimpactfactors]{EnvironmentalImpactFactors} object that help in the conversion of their energy to Natural Gas and Electricity.

The energy is obtained internally from the following facility meters:

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}ll@{}}

\end{longtable}

For the pollutant calculation only the total off-site or purchased electric energy is calculated using Electricity Factors. Off-Site Electricity = Electricity:Facility - ElectricityProduced:Facility, pollutants for the fuel type used by the on-site generator will be calculated, for example Diesel, in these cases.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-9-017}

If a schedule is also specified in the next field, the value specified here, the schedule value, and the fuel consumption are multiplied together for each timestep to determine the source energy contribution for the fuel. If the multipliers in the schedule specified in the next field fully represent the source energy conversion factor, the value in this field should be set to one. If the TDV files (described in next field) are used the value should be 0.293 for electricity and 0.01 for natural gas to account for the units used in the files. Units of J/J.

The use of this field is required for evaluations using source energy factors that change throughout the year such as Time Dependent Valuation (TDV), the method used to show compliance with to California's Title 24 under the ACM (Alternative Compliance Method). Data files containing TDV factors are in the DataSets\textbackslash{}TDV\textbackslash{} directory. An example file for use with TDV file is in the ExampleFiles directory and is named 5zoneTDV.IDF. When using these TDV files with EnergyPlus it is important that a consistent weather file be used. It is also important that the day of the week for January 1 is set to Tuesday since all the TDV and related weather files use 1991 as the year of reference. Also note that the values in the TDV datasets files are in non SI units of measure. The source energy factor field should contain the value of 0.293 for electricity and 0.01 for natural gas to account for the non-standard units used in the files. A summary report that provides a breakdown of the facility energy use in terms of source energy can be obtained by selecting the `\emph{AllSummary}' or `\emph{SourceEnergyEndUseComponentsSummary}' keywords in the `\hyperref[outputtablesummaryreports]{Output:Table:SummaryReports}' reporting object. To learn more about TDV you can see the original methodology used for the 2005 Standards \href{http://h-m-g.com/TDV/}{here} and the 2019 Standards methodology \href{https://www.ethree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TN212524_20160801T120224_2019_TDV_Methodology_Report_7222016.pdf}{here}.

\textbf{WARNING}

\textbf{THE TDV CALCULATIONS SHOULD ONLY BE PERFORMED ON SIMULATIONS THAT USE THE CALIFORNIA THERMAL ZONE (CTZ REV2) WEATHER FILES. One must match the correct TDV file to its corresponding CTZ weather file. There are 16 TDV files, one for each of the 16 CTZ weather files. The Time Dependent Valuation of TDV files provides a relative cost estimate of the various fuel sources and their relative costs by time of day, month of year and outside temperature. Outside temperature is important as demand for electricity and thus cost of electricity is influenced by temperature. These TDV files are applicable only to the hourly weather data contained in the California Thermal Zone (CTZ rev2) weather files as the time dependent cost information is partially derived from the timing of temperatures in the weather file. Thus using the TDV files with other weather data would provide meaningless results.}

\paragraph{Field: Nuclear Low Level Emission Factor Schedule Name}\label{field-nuclear-low-level-emission-factor-schedule-name}

Similar to the source energy calculation, this field contains the name of a schedule containing values that are multiplied by the fuel consumption to determine the total emission values. Specifically, each value in the schedule are multiplied by the emission factor field value and by the fuel consumption to determine the overall emission factor for the fuel. If the values in the schedule fully represent the emission factor, the value in the previous field, should be set to one.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-029}

Various output variables and meters related to emissions are available when modeling with environmental impact and fuel factor inputs. Output is available as either output variables or output meters. The variables and meters available depending on the number of FuelFactor input objects and the type of fuel used in them. Most of the fuel types have the same set of outputs for emissions that correspond to the types of emission factors in the input objects. The exception is electricity which has two additional outputs to track possible net metering situations that can occur with on-site generation.

The following pollution-emission-related outputs are available for environmental impacts.

What shows up in the output are the Energy Meters that were utilized in this particular input file, the pollutants, and the Total Carbon Equivalent.

\subsection{Output:SQLite}\label{outputsqlite}

Output from EnergyPlus can be written to SQLite files for manipulation outside some of the standard (such as spreadsheet) tools.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-12-014}

\paragraph{Field: Option}\label{field-option}

Currently, there are limited capabilities for specifying SQLite generation.~ The Simple option will include all of the predefined database tables as well as time series related data.~ Using the SimpleAndTabular choice adds database tables related to the tabular reports that are already output by EnergyPlus in other formats.~ The description for SQLite outputs is described fully in the Output Details document.

\paragraph{Field: Tabular Unit Conversion}\label{field-tabular-unit-conversion}

This field determines if any unit conversions will be performed for the values in the tabular reports when the Option field is set to SimpleAndTabular. These conversions are only applied to the tabular reports in the SQL file. No conversions are applied to the time series data and predefined database tables generated by the Simple option (see the list in Table \ref{table:tabular_unit_conversion_list}).

This field is optional and, if not specified, defaults to UseOutputControlTableStyle which uses the same unit conversion that appears in the OutputControl:Table:Style object. Five different input options are available:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
UseOutputControlTableStyle -- use the same unit conversion as in OutputControl:Table:Style
\item 
None -- no conversions performed
\item 
JtoKWH -- Joules converted into kWh (1 / 3,600,000)
\item 
JtoMJ -- Joules converted into Megajoules (1 / 1,000,000)
\item
JtoGJ -- Joules converted into Gigajoules (1 / 1,000,000,000)
\item 
InchPound -- convert all annual, monthly, economics and timebins tabular values to common InchPound equivalent
\end{itemize}

The JtoKWH, JtoMJ and JtoGJ unit conversion input option applies only to the Output:Table:Monthly reports and partially to the ABUPS report. For ABUPS, the JtoKWH option changes the report but the JtoMJ and JtoGJ options do not change the report since it is already in MJ/m2 and GJ. In addition, the JtoKWH option also changes results in the LEED Summary report changing GJ to kWh and MJW/m2 to kWh/m2. The InchPound unit conversion input option applies to all annual, monthly, timebins and economic reports that appear in the SQL file. 

Since the Output:SQLite tabular unit conversion setting act on the Tabular reports only, the other SQLite reporting will not affected by this unit conversion setting. The table below lists the affected SQLite tabular tables.

\subsection{OutputControl:Files}\label{outputcontrolfiles}

This object controls the output of various files in a central location.~ This object overrides other output objects in the input file.~ This object is for advanced users who understand their workflows well since this object can have unintended consequences for external programs.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{outputcontrolfiles-inputs}

\paragraph{Field: CSV}\label{field-csv}

When this field is ``\textbf{Yes}'', EnergyPlus will output the Output:Variables and Output:Meters as CSV files using native EnergyPlus.~ This functionality is equivalent to the external ReadVarsESO program, however, it does not use RVI or MVI files to filter or sort output variables.~ The native EnergyPlus CSV output has significantly higher performance than ReadVarsESO, especially for large number of output variables.~ If the ``-r'' command line flag is used to request ReadVarsESO and ``\textbf{Yes}'' is selected for native CSV, ReadVarsESO will be run instead and a warning message will be given.

\paragraph{Field: MTR}\label{field-mtr}

Conditionally turn on or off MTR file output.~ This could have unintended consequences for other programs that assume an MTR file is always generated.

\paragraph{Field: ESO}\label{field-eso}

Conditionally turn on or off ESO file output.~ This could have unintended consequences for other programs that assume an ESO file is always generated.

\paragraph{Field: EIO}\label{field-eio}

Conditionally turn on or off EIO file output.

\paragraph{Field: Tabular}\label{field-tabular}

Conditionally turn on or off all tabular output file(s).

\paragraph{Field: SQLite}\label{field-sqlite}

Conditionally turn on or off SQLite file output.~ If tabular output objects are in the input file, ``\textbf{SimpleAndTabular}'' is selected for SQLite output, Tabular output control is ``\textbf{No}'', and SQLite output control is ``\textbf{Yes}'', there will still be tabular outputs in the SQLite output file.

\paragraph{Field: JSON}\label{field-json}

Conditionally turn on or off JSON output file(s).

\paragraph{Field: AUDIT}\label{field-audit}

Conditionally turn on or off Audit file output.
