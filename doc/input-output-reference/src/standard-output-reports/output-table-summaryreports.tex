\section{Output:Table:SummaryReports}\label{outputtablesummaryreports}

The Output:Table:SummaryReports object controls which predefined tabular reports are produced.~ The easiest option is to specify ``AllSummary'' which will produce all of the summary reports described in this section and does not include any of the Component Load Summary reports. In addition, ``AllMonthly'' will produce all of the monthly reports described. If all predefined reports are needed. ``AllSummaryAndMonthly'' shows all of the summary and monthly predefined reports and does not include any of the Component Load Summary reports. The ``AllSummaryAndSizingPeriod'' option and ``AllSummaryMonthlyAndSizingPeriod'' option are similar and add the Zone Component Load Summary, AirLoop Component Load Summary, and Facility Component Load Summary reports. Including the Component Load Summary reports will increase the simulation run time.

\subsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-064}

\paragraph{Field: Report \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name}\label{field-report-name}

All of the fields in the Output:Table:SummaryReports are the same. A long list of predefined summary reports is available by entering one of the available key choices described below. Each one indicates the name of the predefined reports that should be output. The input AllSummary will cause all the reports described below to be created.~ The Report \textless{}\#\textgreater{} Name field can be repeated.

\subsubsection{Predefined Annual Summary Reports}\label{predefined-annual-summary-reports}

\paragraph{Annual Building Utility Performance Summary (sometimes called ABUPS)}\label{annual-building-utility-performance-summary-sometimes-called-abups}

The Annual Building Utility Performance Summary report often called ABUPS -- (key: AnnualBuildingUtilityPerformanceSummary) produces a report that is an overall summary of the utility consumption of the building. It contains a number of subtables that are each described below.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Site and Source Energy -- Indicates the total site and source energy use. For electricity the net electricity from the utility is used for the electric contribution. The site to source conversion factors are based on those entered by the user. These are entered in the \hyperref[environmentalimpactfactors]{EnvironmentalImpactFactors} object and \hyperref[fuelfactors]{FuelFactors} objects.
\item
  Building Area -- Shows the total floorspace of the building and the conditioned floorspace.

Not all fuels have corresponding end uses. The values in this sub-table are from output meters. To determine which components are attached to each end-use meter, consult the meter details output file (*.mtd). The source of the resource does not affect this table -- the amount of electricity used for lights does not change if the electricity is from the utility or from an on-site generator. The district heating column also includes steam.
\item
  End Uses By Subcategory -- Shows a breakdown of the major end uses by user-defined category. If an end-use subcategory was not input for an object, it is automatically added to the General subcategory for that major end-use category.
\item
  Utility Use Per Floor Area -- These two sub-tables show the results from the end-uses table divided by the total floor area defined for the building and for the total conditioned floor area. Only three categories for end-uses are used for these sub-tables, lighting, HVAC and other. HVAC includes fans, pumps, heating, cooling, heat rejection, humidification, and domestic hot water heating. The district heating column also includes steam.
\item
  Electric Loads Satisfied -- Shows the different methods that electric loads are satisfied in the building. The values shown for on site power generation are: Fuel-Fired Power Generation, High Temperature Geothermal, Photovoltaic Power, and Wind Power. The flows to and from the electric utility are shown next and finally the total electricity used at the site is compared to the total generated on site plus the net amount from the electric utility.

\paragraph{Component Load Summary}\label{component-load-summary}

Three different component load summary reports can be generated:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zone Component Loads Summary
\item
  AirLoop Component Loads Summary
\item
  Facility Component Loads Summary
\end{itemize}

The AirLoop and Facility level reports are generally aggregations of the results reported in the Zone Component Loads Summary report. The Component Loads Summary reports provide an estimate of the heating and cooling peak loads for each zone, airloop or the entire facility broken down into various components. These reports may help determine which components of the load have the largest impact for the heating and cooling peak design conditions. When specified, the Zone Component Loads Summary report is created for each zone that is conditioned. Similarly, the AirLoop Component Load Summary is generated for each AirLoop and a single Facility Component Loads Summary is generated for the entire facility. The difference between the peak design sensible load and the estimated instant + delayed sensible load (as shown in the \emph{Peak Conditions} subtable) is an indication of how consistent the overall total estimate may be to the computed total peak loads for the zone. When the report is called the zone sizing calculations are repeated twice so this may result in longer simulation times.~ The keys used to obtain these reports are ZoneComponentLoadSummary, AirLoopComponentLoadSummary, and FacilityComponentLoadSummary. Since including this report may increase the simulation time, new key options have been added that will display all reports but the Zone Component Load Summary those keys used are AllSummaryButZoneComponentLoad and AllSummaryAndMonthlyButZoneComponentLoad.

The report has six parts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimated Cooling Peak Load Components
\end{itemize}

Contains the sensible-instant, sensible-delay, sensible-return air, latent, total and \%grand total for people, lights, equipment, refrigeration, water use equipment, HVAC equipment loads, power generation equipment, infiltration, zone ventilation, interzone mixing, roof, interzone ceiling, other roof, exterior wall, interzone wall, ground contact wall, other wall, exterior floor, interzone floor, ground contact floor, other floor, fenestration conduction, fenestration solar, opaque door. The values in the sensible-delay column are estimated using a procedure shown in the Engineering Reference. Also shown are the related areas for each type of component. For \hyperref[people]{People} and \hyperref[lights-000]{Lights} the floor area is shown but for walls, fenestration. and other surfaces, the area of that surface is used.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cooling Peak Conditions
\end{itemize}

Contains the time of the peak load and the outside dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures as well as the outside humidity ratio for that time. It also shows the zone temperature and relative humidity and humidity ratio for that time. The airflow and outside airflow as well as the supply air temperature are shown. Also the sensible peak load accounting for the sizing factor is shown along with the difference due to the sizing factor.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Engineering Checks for Cooling
\end{itemize}

This table shows some ratios that may be handy in evaluating the results. It contains the percentage of outside air, the airflow per floor area, the airflow per capacity, the floor area per capacity and the capacity per floor area. It also shows the number of people.


\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimated Heating Peak Load Components
\end{itemize}

Contains the sensible-instant, sensible-delay, sensible-return air, latent, total and \%grand total for people, lights, equipment, refrigeration, water use equipment, HVAC equipment loads, power generation equipment, infiltration, zone ventilation, interzone mixing, roof, interzone ceiling, other roof, exterior wall, interzone wall, ground contact wall, other wall, exterior floor, interzone floor, ground contact floor, other floor, fenestration conduction, fenestration solar, opaque door. The values in the sensible-day column are estimated using a procedure shown in the Engineering Reference. Also shown are the related areas for each type of component. For \hyperref[people]{People} and \hyperref[lights-000]{Lights} the floor area is shown but for walls, fenestration. and other surfaces, the area of that surface is used.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Heating Peak Conditions
\end{itemize}

Contains the time of the peak load and the outside dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures as well as the outside humidity ratio for that time. It also shows the zone temperature and the relative humidity and humidity ratio for that time. The airflow and outside airflow as well as the supply air temperature are shown. Also the sensible peak load accounting for the sizing factor is shown along with the difference due to the sizing factor

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Engineering Checks for Heating
\end{itemize}

This table shows some ratios that may be handy in evaluating the results. It contains the percentage of outside air, the airflow per floor area, the airflow per capacity, the floor area per capacity and the capacity per floor area. It also shows the number of people.

The Air Loop Component Summary tables also include tables that indicate the zones included in the aggregated results for heating and cooling.

If the time of the peak load for each Zone for cooling exactly matches the time of the peak load for the AirLoop or Facility than the Estimated Cooling Peak Load Components will represent a sum of the values from the corresponding zones. Likewise the Estimated Heating Peak Load Components will add up for the AirLoop or Facility if the times of the heating peaks exactly match. This is not necessarily the case for Peak Conditions or the Engineering Checks tables. Since the sizing of Airloops is based on the system sizing they usually will be different than the sum of the corresonding zones.

\paragraph{Standard 62.1 Summary}\label{standard-62.1-summary}

\paragraph{Energy Meters Summary}\label{energy-meters-summary}

The Energy Meters Summary (key: EnergyMeters) (which is a slight misnomer as some meters may not be strictly energy) provides the annual period (runperiod) results for each meter (reference the meter data dictionary file (.mdd) and/or the meter details file (.mtd). The results are broken out by fuel type (resource type) in this report.

\paragraph{Initialization Summary}\label{initialization-summary}

The Initialization Summary (key: InitializationSummary) provides the information shown in the initialization output file (.eio) but in a tabular format. Due to this, some of the outputs my be difficult to understand without referencing the documentation on the .eio file that is located in the Output Details and Examples document.

\paragraph{LEED Summary}\label{leed-summary}

The LEED Summary report provides many of the simulation results required for certification of Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1 Optimized Energy Performance according to the LEED Green Building Rating System\textsuperscript{TM}. The report can be produced by specifying LEEDSummary in Output:Table:SummaryReports which is also part of the AllSummary option. Directly following is an example of this report.

\paragraph{Tariff Report}\label{TariffReport}

The Tariff Report provides the results of the \hyperref[utilitycosttariff]{UtilityCost:Tariff} object. The report consists of a summary table, categories, charges, ratchets, qualifies, native variables, other variables and computation. The key used to obtain this report is TariffReport.

\paragraph{Economic Result Summary}\label{EconomicResultSummary}

The Economic Result Summary provides a summary of the Tariff Reports. The report consists of annual costs and costs for each tariff considered and why it was or was not selected. The key used to obtain this report is EconomicResultSummary.

\paragraph{Component Cost Economics Summary}\label{component-cost-economics-summary}

The Component Cost Economics Summary provides the construction cost estimate summary for the project. The costs are broken into eight catagories and the reference building costs are provided as a comparison. A second table is also produced that provides line item details with one line for every line item object. The key used to obtain this report is ComponentCostEconomicsSummary.

\paragraph{Life Cycle Cost Report}\label{LifeCycleCostReport}

The Life Cycle Cost Report provides a summary of the information from the Life Cycle Cost calculations.  This report shows the costs and the timing of costs, often called “cash flows,” along with the present value in several different tables. The tabular results show the present value of all current and future costs. The key used to obtain this report is LifeCycleCostReport.

\paragraph{Heat Emissions Report}\label{HeatEmissionsReport}

The Heat Emissions Report provides a summary of the building heat emission to the ambient air. This report shows the heat emissions from buildings by surface heat transfer, zone exhaust, zone relief, HVAC relief, HVAC heat rejection, as well as the total emissions. The key used to obtain this report is HeatEmissionsSummary.

\paragraph{Thermal Resilience Summary}\label{ThermalResilienceSummary}

The Thermal Resilience Summary provides the indoor thermal resilience metrics unmet hours and occupant$·$hours summary report. This includes the Heat Index Hours and OccupantHours, Humidex Hours and OccupantHours, Heating SET Hours and Cooling SET Hours reports. The Heating SET Hours and Cooling SET Hours are reported only when the Pierce model are chosen for thermal comfort calculations. To activate the Pierce SET calculation in EnergyPlus, users need to define the \textbf{People} and chose \textbf{Pierce} as the thermal comfort method.

\paragraph{CO2 Resilience Summary}\label{CO2ResilienceSummary}

The CO2 Resilience Summary provides the indoor CO2 level unmet hours and occupant$·$hours summary report for resilience. This includes the CO2 Level Hours and OccupantHours reports. To activate the $CO_2$ concentration calculation in EnergyPlus, the \textbf{ZoneAirContaminantBalance} object needs to be specified and with the field \textbf{Carbon Dioxide Concentration} set to Yes. Users can define a schedule of outdoor air $CO_2$ concentration in the field \textbf{Outdoor Carbon Dioxide Schedule Name}. $CO_2$ generation rate at the zone level can be specified using the \textbf{ZoneContaminantSourceAndSink:CarbonDioxide} object.

\paragraph{Visual Resilience Summary}\label{VisualResilienceSummary}

The Visual Resilience Summary provides the indoor illuminance level unmet hours and occupant$·$hours summary report for resilience. This includes the Illuminance Level Hours and OccupantHours reports. To activate the indoor illuminance calculation in EnergyPlus, users need to define the \textbf{Daylighting:Controls} and the \textbf{Daylighting:ReferencePoint} objects, even if no daylighting controls are actually implemented in the building simulation model.

\subsubsection{Predefined Monthly Summary Reports}\label{predefined-monthly-summary-reports}

The predefined monthly report options are shown below. The key name of the predefined monthly report is all that is needed to have that report appear in the tabular output file. After each report name below are the output variables and aggregation types used. These cannot be modified when using the predefined reports but if changes are desired, a \hyperref[outputtablemonthly]{Output:Table:Monthly} can be used instead. The StandardReports.idf file in the DataSets directory includes a \hyperref[outputtablemonthly]{Output:Table:Monthly} that exactly corresponds to the predefined monthly reports shown below. They can be copied into an IDF file and extended if additional variables are desired. A listing of each available key for predefined monthly summary reports follows with a discrption of the variables included.
