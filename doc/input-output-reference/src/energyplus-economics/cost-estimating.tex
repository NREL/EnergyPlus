\section{Cost Estimating}\label{cost-estimating}

In order to understand how to include cost estimates, it may be helpful to first define some terminology and provide an overview of the process used in EnergyPlus. There are three broad steps involved. The first involves determining \emph{construction} costs by summing individual ``line items.''~ The second involves determining \emph{project} costs by adjusting construction costs to account for things like profit and design fees. The third involves comparing the current simulation to a reference case so that marginal increases can be calculated. Each of these steps involves using one of the three `ComponentCost' objects described below.

\subsection{ComponentCost:LineItem}\label{componentcostlineitem}

Each instance of this object creates a cost line item and will contribute to the total for a cost estimate. Each line item is reported in table form in the tabular report file. The user must request that this report be generated by including a \hyperref[outputtablesummaryreports]{Output:Table:SummaryReports} object with the Component Cost Economics Summary option selected. The style of a tabular report can be controlled using the \hyperref[outputcontroltablestyle]{OutputControl:Table:Style} object.

Cost estimates are not currently general in that they cannot be performed for every type of component that could be included in an EnergyPlus model. Although a ``General'' option is available where all information needed for the cost line item is input by the user, the usefulness of cost modeling within EnergyPlus is expected to be enhanced when quantities are obtained from elsewhere in the input file or computed during a simulation. The cost computations are programmed in selected ways for selected objects. The objects available and the type of cost modeling that may be performed are discussed in detail in the discussion of Reference Object Type field. A particular instance of this object will always have many blank fields. Entering values in too many fields may cause an error because the program may determine how a particular cost is to be calculated based on the presence of non-zero values in particular fields. The input object includes fields that are reserved for future use in expanded cost estimate and investment analyses planned for future versions of EnergyPlus. If you would like to request additional objects or different methods of modeling component costs, feel free to describe your needs and submit a request via email to energyplus-support@gard.com.

\subsubsection{Inputs}

\paragraph{Field: Name}\label{componentcostlineitem-field-name}

This field is a user-selected name that will appear in the line item description of the cost report. It is not used in the calculation but allows identifying a line item in the subsequent report.

\paragraph{Field: Type}\label{field-type}

This field is not yet used and may be left blank.

\paragraph{Field: Line Item Type}\label{field-line-item-type}

The cost estimate line item calculation will be controlled by the name entered in this field. The requirements for the remaining input, and the cost calculations performed, will vary depending on the object referenced here. Only selected objects can be entered here. The objects available for cost estimating are listed in the following table showing the active fields and options available for each.

\subparagraph{General}\label{general}


This choice of object is used to calculate costs in a general way. No quantities from internal calculations are used. All information needed for the cost line item is input by the user. The Cost per Each and the Quantity fields that follow need to have values.

\subparagraph{Construction}\label{construction-costlineitem}

This choice of object type is used to calculate the costs associated with surfaces based on the type of \hyperref[construction-000]{Construction} used for the surface. Costs are entered on a per-square-meter basis. The program finds all the surfaces that have the type of \hyperref[construction-000]{Construction} named in the Reference Object Name field that follows and determines the total area. If the model includes duplicate surfaces, as for interior partitions or floors, these will be detected and not double-counted. The cost entered in \hyperref[field-cost-per-area]{Cost per Area} field (\$/m\(^{2}\)) is used for each surface. The line item subtotal is calculated by multiplying the number of units by \hyperref[field-cost-per-area]{Cost per Area}. The \hyperref[field-cost-per-area]{Cost per Area} should include all the material layers defined in the \hyperref[construction-000]{Construction}.

\subparagraph{Coil:DX or Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}\label{coildx-or-coilcoolingdxsinglespeed}

This choice of object type is used to calculate the cost of direct expansion cooling equipment. Cost can be entered in three different ways, (1) per each, (2) per kW total cooling capacity, or (3) per kW total cooling capacity per COP (coefficient of performance). The program will determine which method to use by examining which input fields have non-zero values. It is an error to specify costs in more than one way. The per-each approach is most useful for discrete packages. The per-kW approach is useful for autosizing DX coils with the same COP. The per-kW-per-COP approach is convenient for modeling autosized DX coils with differing COPs as long as a linear relationship is sufficient.

The wildcard character ``*'' may be used in the object name field that follows to allow a single line item to include all of the DX coils in the model.

\subparagraph{Coil:Heating:Fuel}\label{coilheatinggas}

This choice of object type is used to calculate the cost of gas-fired heating equipment. Cost can be entered in three different ways, (1) per each, (2) per kW of heating capacity, or (3) per kW total cooling capacity per nominal efficiency (actually uses the per kW per COP field). The program will determine which method to use by examining which input fields have non-zero values. It is an error to specify costs in more than one way. The per-each approach is most useful for discrete packages. The per-kW approach is useful for autosizing heating coils with the same efficiency. The per-kW-per-Eff approach is convenient for modeling autosized heating coils with differing efficiencies as long as a linear relationship is sufficient.

The wildcard character ``*'' may be used in the object name field that follows to allow a single line item to include all of the gas heating coils in the model.

\subparagraph{Chiller:Electric}\label{chiller-electric-costlineitem}

This choice of object type is used to calculate the cost of a central chiller. The object name entered in following field must correspond to a \hyperref[chillerelectric]{Chiller:Electric} object name defined elsewhere in the input file. Cost can be entered in three different ways, (1) per each, (2) per kW total cooling capacity or (3) per kW total cooling capacity per COP (coefficient of performance). The program will determine which method to use by examining which input fields have non-zero values. It is an error to specify costs in more than one way. The per-each approach is most useful for discrete chillers. The per-kW approach is useful for autosizing chillers with the same COP. The per-kW-per-COP approach is convenient for modeling autosized chillers with differing COPs as long as a linear relationship is sufficient.
\subparagraph{Daylighting:Controls}\label{daylightingcontrols}

These choices of object type are used to include the cost of controllers needed to control electric lighting in response to daylight. The only option for entering costs is ``per each''. The wildcard character ``*'' may be used in the following object name field to allow a single line item to include all of the simple and detailed daylighting controls in the cost model.

\subparagraph{Shading:Zone:Detailed}\label{shadingzonedetailed}

This choice of object type is used to calculate the costs associated with attached shading surfaces. Costs are entered on a per-square-meter basis. The cost calculations are similar to those for heat transfer surfaces but are handled separately because ``Construction'' is not defined for a shading surface. The object name entered in the following field must correspond to a \hyperref[shadingzonedetailed-000]{Shading:Zone:Detailed} object name defined elsewhere in the input file.

\subparagraph{Lights}\label{lights}

This choice of object is used to calculate the costs associated with electric lighting. Costs are entered on either a cost-per-each basis or as a cost-per-kilowatt-of-design-level. (This design level is an input in the \hyperref[lights-000]{Lights} object.). The object name entered into the following field must match the name of a Zone object defined elsewhere in the input file.

\subparagraph{Generator:Photovoltaic}\label{generatorphotovoltaic}

This choice of object is used to calculate the costs associated with a photovoltaic system. Costs are entered on a cost-per-kilowatt-of-rated-capacity. The rated capacity of a photovoltaic generator is calculated for cost modeling by exposing the surface to a 1000 W/m\(^{2}\) incident radiation using the area fraction and nominal fixed efficiency input by the user (from the \hyperref[generatorphotovoltaic-000]{Generator:Photovoltaic} object). The object name entered into the following field must match the name of a \hyperref[generatorphotovoltaic-000]{Generator:Photovoltaic} ~object defined elsewhere in the input file.

\paragraph{Field: Item Name}\label{field-item-name}

This field is used to refer to a specific instance of an object. The wildcard character ``*'' is acceptable for some objects as described above for the previous field.

This field is used to enter cost information on a per-area basis. The units are dollars per square meter (\$/m\(^{2}\)).

\paragraph{Field: Cost per Unit of Output Capacity}\label{field-cost-per-unit-of-output-capacity}

This field is used to enter cost information on a per-kilowatt basis. The units are dollars per kilowatt (\$/kW).

\paragraph{Field: Cost per Unit of Output Capacity per COP}\label{field-cost-per-unit-of-output-capacity-per-cop}

This field is used to enter cost information on a per-kilowatt-per-COP basis. The units are dollars per kilowatt per non-dimensional COP (\$/kW-COP).~ Note that this field can be used for \hyperref[coilheatinggas-000]{Coil:Heating:Fuel} cost modeling in which case the better terminology would be per-kilowatt-per-non-dimensional-efficiency.

\paragraph{Field: Cost per Volume}\label{field-cost-per-volume}

This field is not yet used but will be used to enter cost information on a per-cubic-meter basis. The units are dollars per cubic meter (\$/m\(^{3}\)).

\paragraph{Field: Cost per Volume Rate}\label{field-cost-per-volume-rate}

This field is not yet used but will be used to enter cost information on a per-cubic-meter-per-second basis. The units are dollars per cubic meter (\$/(m\(^{3}\)/s)).

\paragraph{Field: Cost per Energy per Temperature Difference}\label{field-cost-per-energy-per-temperature-difference}

This field is not yet used but will be used to enter cost information on a per-watt-per-Kelvin basis. These units will be used to represent a UA description of coils and the like. The units are dollars per watt per delta K (\$/(W/K)).

\paragraph{Field: Quantity}\label{field-quantity}

This field is used to directly enter the line item quantity. The units should correspond to what is used in the Per Each field.

This field allows including the costs of project elements that go beyond what can be modeled using ``\hyperref[componentcostlineitem]{ComponentCost:LineItem}'' input objects including such things as structural components, site preparation, finishes, etc. The value input in this field will be multiplied by the conditioned floor area and listed in the Construction Cost Estimate Summary table. The miscellaneous project costs are added to the line item model total to determine the ``modeled and miscellaneous Construction costs'' that will be multiplied by the fractions in the following five fields.

\paragraph{Field: Design and Engineering Fees}\label{field-design-and-engineering-fees}
