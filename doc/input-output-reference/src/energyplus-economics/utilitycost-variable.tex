\paragraph{Field: January through December Values}\label{field-january-through-december-values}

An entry (up to 24 are available) of the monthly values of the variable. Normally 12 months are used for most utility rates and so 12 values should be entered. If any values are not entered, the value of the previous entry is used. This allows a variable that is constant for an entire year to be entered using only the first value.
