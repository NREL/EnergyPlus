\chapter{EMS Examples}\label{ems-examples}

This section provides examples that demonstrate how to use the EMS. Each example provides a problem statement, discusses how to approach a solution using EMS, and provides example EMS input objects. For each example a complete input data file is provided with the EnergyPlus release (you can find this in the ExampleFiles\textbackslash{} directory).

A range of example applications is presented here. Each is presented in isolation for simplicity, but a much more comprehensive approach to EMS programs is also possible.
