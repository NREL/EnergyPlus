\section{EDD File}\label{edd-file}

If the Erl programs are processed and start running, the EDD becomes a primary source of information for debugging. The EDD file is the output file associated only with the EMS. When a line of Erl code is executed, and full trace is selected, the program will output records that are useful for debugging.

It is very important to be careful with the EDD file. There are options to control how verbose the EDD file becomes with modes such as only the errors or a full trace. The full trace option should be used with care because a full line-by-line trace of EMS program execution for an annual run can easily create an enormous file that is too large for most computer systems.
