\subsection{Condenser Operation}\label{condenser-operation}

An actuator called ``Refrigeration:System'' is available with a control type called ``Minimum Condensing Temperature.''~ The units for this actuator are degrees Celsius.~ This actuator is available in models that use the Refrigeration:System object.~ This actuator allows the user to override the usually constant value that is input into the field called Minimum Condensing Temperature in the Refrigeration:System object.~ This allows operating the condenser using custom control algorithms.
