\section{Sizing}\label{sizing}

\subsection{Sizing:Zone}\label{sizingzone}

A series of actuators called ``Sizing:Zone'' is available. These offer a way to override the results of zone sizing calculations. The unique identifier for each is the name of the Zone Input object. The following control types are available:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Zone Design Heating Air Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
\item
  Zone Design Cooling Air Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
\item
  Zone Design Heating Load (W)
\item
  Zone Design Cooling Load (W)
\item
  Zone Design Heating Vol Flow (m\(^{3}\)/s)
\item
  Zone Design Cooling Vol Flow (m\(^{3}\)/s)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Sizing}\label{system-sizing}

A series of actuators called ``Sizing:System'' is available. These offer a way to override the results of air system sizing calculations. The unique identifier is the name of the AirLoopHVAC input object. The following control types are available:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Main Supply Volume Flow Rate (m\(^{3}\)/s)
\item
  Main Supply Coincident Peak Cooling Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
\item
  Main Supply Coincident Peak Heating Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
\item
  Main Supply Noncoincident Peak Cooling Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
\item
  Main Supply Noncoincident Peak Heating Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
\item
  Main Heating Volume Flow Rate (m\(^{3}\)/s)
\item
  Main Cooling Volume Flow Rate (m\(^{3}\)/s)
\end{itemize}
