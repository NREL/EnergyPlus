\section{Sizing}\label{sizing-000}

Several internal variables relate to sizing calculations. Although the primary intent for the EMS is to enable custom controls for operation, using internal variables is a prime example of extending the power of user-defined calculations to control certain aspects of sizing calculations.

\subsection{Sizing:Zone}\label{sizingzone-000}

\item
  Final Zone Design Cooling Air Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
\item
  Intermediate Zone Design Cooling Air Mass Flow Rate (kg/s)
\item
  Final Zone Design Heating Load (W)
