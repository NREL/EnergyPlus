\section{Organization}\label{organization}

We first describe Erl, then discuss its rules and features, including syntax for writing statements, variables, expressions, and built-in functions. We then discuss sensors, actuators, and calling points for the EMS. Then we describe a set of examples applications for EMS. The last section provides information about debugging Erl programs.
