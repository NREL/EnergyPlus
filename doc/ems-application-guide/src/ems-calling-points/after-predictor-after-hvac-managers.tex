\section{After Predictor After HVAC Managers}\label{after-predictor-after-hvac-managers}

The calling point called ``AfterPredictorAfterHVACManagers'' occurs after the predictor and after the traditional HVAC managers have been called. It occurs at each timestep after the predictor executes and after the SetpointManager and AvailabilityManager models are called. It is useful for a variety of control actions. However, if there are conflicts, SetpointManager or AvailabilityManager actions may be overwritten by EMS control actions.
