\section{User Defined Component Model}\label{user-defined-component-model}

The calling point called ``UserDefinedComponentModel'' is used with Erl programs that are associated with user defined component models.~ This calling point is executed whenever a user-defined component model is called to simulate.~ The user defined component models track which program calling managers are associated with the specific component and only those calling managers are executed when this calling point is triggered. This calling point is only used with calling managers referenced by the following input objects: PlantComponent:UserDefined, Coil:UserDefined, ZoneHVAC:ForcedAir:UserDefined, or AirTerminal:SingleDuct:UserDefined.
