\section{Begin New Environment}\label{begin-new-environment}

The calling point referred to with the keyword ``BeginNewEnvironment'' occurs once near the beginning of each environment period. Environment periods include sizing periods, design days, and run periods. This calling point will not be useful for control actions, but is useful for initializing variables and calculations that do not need to be repeated during each timestep. Once a value is set, Erl variables remember the value during the course of a simulation. Considerable repetition can be avoided by designing Erl programs to use this calling point for initializations and calculations that are needed only once. It is not called during individual timesteps.
