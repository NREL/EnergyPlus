\section{Schedules}\label{schedules-000}

The EnergyManagementSystem:Sensor object can also provide scheduled data for use in Erl programs. Because schedule values are available as outputs that use the ``Schedule Value'' output, they can also be mapped as sensors. You can use any of the various types of schedule input objects to define a schedule. The schedule does not need to be used elsewhere in the model. The value of the schedule is then mapped to an EMS variable with the Schedule Value report variable. When used with the Schedule:File input object, the sensor object can import time series data into the EMS from an external file. One application might be to test a proposed EMS algorithm with real experimental data.
