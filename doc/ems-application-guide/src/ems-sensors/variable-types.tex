\section{Variable Types}\label{variable-types}

Various types of output variables in EnergyPlus can be used as sensors in the EMS. It is important to understand some distinctions.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Reported variables have two update frequencies: \textbf{zone} and \textbf{system}. Zone variables are updated for each zone timestep. System variables are updated for each system timestep.
\item
  Reported variables have two types of content: \textbf{averaged} and \textbf{summed}. Averaged variables are state variables such as temperature and mass flow rate. Summed variables are quantities of energy such as electricity use.
\end{itemize}
