libtk205
===========

A C++ library autogenerated from the current version of the ASHRAE Standard 205P data exchange specification. The C++ template code is available in the ASHRAE 205 [toolkit](https://github.com/open205/toolkit-205.git), which also provides cross-format translation of ASHRAE205 schema and examples.

**Disclaimer:** While this library is developed in conjunction with the ASHRAE Standard 205 project committee, it is not an official ASHRAE product or a part of the standard.

About ASHRAE 205
----------------

ASHRAE Standard 205 is "Standard Representation of Performance Simulation Data for HVAC&R and Other Facility Equipment". While the standard is not yet published, an overview of its supported features is available at [ashrae.org](http://data.ashrae.org/standard205/).

Building libtk205
--------------------

To build the library, use

`cmake -B build` 

to generate build files for an "out-of-source" build directory, then

`cmake --build build --config [Debug/Release]`

to build libtk205.

Testing the library is possible using

`cd build && ctest`

Example Usage
-------------

*libtk205* uses a factory pattern to create and populate instances of a representation. The client is responsible for the allocation and lifetime management of pointers to representations. For example, using an ASHRAE205 representation file chiller.cbor, one might create an RS0001 object as follows:
```
// Header.h
#include "rs0001.h"
std::shared_ptr<tk205::rs0001_ns::RS0001> representation;
```
```
// Impl.cpp
#include "rs0001_factory.h"
using namespace tk205;
representation = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<rs0001_ns::RS0001>(RSInstanceFactory::create("RS0001", "chiller.cbor"));
```
or, to utilize the representation base class,
```
// Header.h
#include "rs_instance_base.h"
std::shared_ptr<tk205::RSInstanceBase> representation;
```
```
#include "rs0001_factory.h"
using namespace tk205;
representation = RSInstanceFactory::create("RS0001", "chiller.cbor");
```

Once the instance is created, any of its public members are available through the pointer interface; see unit test files for implementation examples. Critically, the `calculate_performance` overloaded function returns the equipment performance at a particular set of grid variables:
```
representation->performance.performance_map_cooling.calculate_performance(0.0755, 280.0, 0.0957, 295.0, 0.5);
```
See the ASHRAE205 standard for details about equipment parameterization.

The client may optionally register a callback function that handles libtk205 errors (strings) in the preferred way:

```
void Display_message(tk205::MsgSeverity severity, const std::string &message, void *ctx)
{
    if (severity == tk205::MsgSeverity::ERR_205)
    {
      std::cout << "ERROR: " << message << std::endl;
    }
}

tk205::set_error_handler(Display_message, nullptr);
```
