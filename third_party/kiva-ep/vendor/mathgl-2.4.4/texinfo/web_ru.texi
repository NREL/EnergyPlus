@item
a library with large and growing set of graphics.

Now MathGL has more than 35000 lines of code, more than 55 general types of graphics for 1d, 2d and 3d data arrays, including special ones for chemical and statistical graphics. It can export graphics to raster and vector (EPS or SVG) formats. It has Qt, FLTK, OpenGL interfaces and can be used even from console programs. It has functions for data processing and script MGL language for simplification of data plotting. Also it has several types of transparency and smoothed lightning, vector fonts and TeX-like symbol parsing, arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system and many over useful things. It can be used from code written on C++/C/Fortran/Python/Octave and many other languages. Finally it is platform independent and free (under GPL v.2.0 license).

There is a @uref{http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=152187, forum} where you can ask a question or suggest an improvement. However the @uref{http://groups.google.com/group/mathgl, MathGL group} is preferable for quicker answer.

@strong{About LGPL and GPL licenses.}
Generally, MathGL is GPL library. However, you can use LGPL license for MathGL core and widgets if you don't use SWIG-based interfaces and disable GSL features. This can be done by using @code{lgpl} option at build time. According this, I've added the LGPL win32 binaries into @ref{Download} page.

MathGL can plot a wide range of graphics. It includes:
@itemize @bullet
@item
one-dimensional: @ref{plot}, @ref{area}, @ref{bars}, @ref{step}, @ref{stem}, @ref{torus}, @ref{chart}, @ref{error}, @ref{tube}, @ref{mark}, (@ref{1D plotting});

@item
two-dimensional plots: @ref{mesh}, @ref{surf}, @ref{dens}, @ref{cont}, @ref{contf}, @ref{boxs}, @ref{axial}, @ref{fall}, @ref{belt}, @ref{tile}, including surfaces transparent (@ref{surfa}) or colored (@ref{surfc}) by another data (@ref{2D plotting});

@item
three-dimensional plots: @ref{surf3}, @ref{dens3}, @ref{cont3}, @ref{contf3}, @ref{cloud}-like, including isosurfaces transparent (@ref{surf3a}) or colored (@ref{surf3c}) by another data (@ref{3D plotting});

@item
vector fields plots: vector fields @ref{vect}, @ref{vect3} and @ref{traj}, @ref{flow} threads, flow @ref{pipe}, @ref{map} chart, and so on (@ref{Vector fields});

@item
and so on. See also @ref{All samples}.
@end itemize

In fact, I created the functions for drawing of all the types of scientific plots that I know. The list of plots is growing; if you need some special type of a plot then please email me @email{mathgl.abalakin@@gmail.com, e-mail} and it will appear in the new version.

I tried to make plots as nice looking as possible: e.g., a surface can be transparent and highlighted by several (up to 10) light sources. Most of the drawing functions have 2 variants: simple one for the fast plotting of data, complex one for specifying of the exact position of the plot (including parametric representation). Resulting image can be saved in bitmap PNG, JPEG, TGA, BMP format, or in vector EPS, SVG or TeX format, or in 3D formats OBJ, OFF, STL or in PRC format.

All texts are drawn by vector fonts, which allows for high scalability and portability. Texts may contain commands for: some of the TeX-like symbols, changing index (upper or lower indexes) and the style of font inside the text string. Texts of ticks are rotated with axis rotation. It is possible to create a legend of plot and put text in an arbitrary position on the plot. Arbitrary text encoding (by the help of function @code{setlocale()}) and UTF-16 encoding are supported.

Special class mglData is used for data encapsulation. In addition to a safe creation and deletion of data arrays it includes functions for data processing (smoothing, differentiating, integrating, interpolating and so on) and reading of data files with automatic size determination. Class mglData can handle arrays with up to three dimensions (arrays which depend on up to 3 independent indexes @math{a_@{ijk@}}). Using an array with higher number of dimensions is not meaningful, because I do not know how it can be plotted. Data filling and modification may be done manually or by textual formulas.

There is fast evaluation of a textual mathematical expression. It is based on string precompilation to tree-like code at the creation of class instance. At evaluation stage code performs only fast tree-walk and returns the value of the expression. In addition to changing data values, textual formulas are also used for drawing in @emph{arbitrary} curvilinear coordinates. A set of such curvilinear coordinates is limited only by user's imagination rather than a fixed list like: polar, parabolic, spherical, and so on.
