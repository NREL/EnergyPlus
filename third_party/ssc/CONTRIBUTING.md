# Contributing to SSC
The team welcomes your contribution to the project! 

You can contribute to SSC by letting us know about problems or suggesting new features, or by making your own changes or additions to the code. You may want to report or help us fix an [issue someone else reported](https://github.com/NREL/ssc/issues), fix an issue you discovered, or add a new feature to SSC. If you have a question about using SSC or SAM, you can ask us on the [SAM support forum](https://sam.nrel.gov/support).

## SSC Contribution Policy  

In the effort to make SAM easy to contribute to, the contribution process is composed of four simple steps:  

1. To get started, <a href="https://www.clahub.com/agreements/NREL/ssc">sign the Contributor License Agreement</a>.
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the relevant SAM [repositories](https://github.com/NREL/SAM/wiki/Software-Dependencies). 
3. Make your modifications.  For large new features, we suggest that you email us at <sam.support@nrel.gov> before you start working so that we coordinate your contribution (see more info for large contributions below!).
4. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

### Additional contribution help
Some additional details on what makes it more likely that your code will be readily accepted into the main development version of SAM.

<details><summary>For large contributions</summary>
<p>
If your contribution is larger (e.g. a new feature), it helps us to have a detailed description of the project that you are proposing, the precise functionalities that you plan to implement as part of the project, and a time frame for implementation. After we review your materials, we may ask you to revise your materials. For the greatest likelihood of success, it would be great to align on functionalities to be addressed.  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Code quality and testing</summary>
<p>
We want SAM to adhere to high quality standards. Please try and broadly adhere to the same style of code in the area you will be working. Any bugs, either discovered by you, us, or any users will be tracked on the GitHub issues page for the specific repository (SSC or SAM). We request you that you take full responsibility for correcting bugs. We'd also really love for you to write a new unit test for the code you contribute!

<details><summary>Documentation</summary>
<p>
Proper documentation is crucial for our users; without it users will not know how to use your contribution!  If you add a new feature to SAM, we please ask you to submit some documentation as a Word, LaTex, Markdown or simple text document that our team will integrate SAM’s Help system.

<details><summary>Resources for learning GitHub</summary>
<p>

If you are new to GitHub, you can find helpful articles to help you learn how it works on the web. Some examples are:

* [Using the Fork-and-Branch Git Workflow](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) from Scott's Weblog is a good introduction.

* [Git Concepts: Branches, Forks, and Pull Requests](http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/12/git-concepts-branches-forks-and-pull-requests/) from Will Anderson is useful, although the video on the page does not work.

* [3.2 Git Branching - Basic Branching and Merging](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) from the Git documentation.

* [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) from GitHub Help.

* [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) from GitHub Help.
