Returns the payment on the principal for a given period for an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.

Syntax

PPMT(rate,per,nper,pv,fv,type)

For a more complete description of the arguments in PPMT, see PV.

Rate   is the interest rate per period.

Per   specifies the period and must be in the range 1 to nper.

Nper   is the total number of payment periods in an annuity.

Pv   is the present value ï¿½ the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now.

Fv   is the future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (zero), that is, the future value of a loan is 0.

Type   is the number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due.

Set type equal to If payments are due
0 or omitted At the end of the period
1 At the beginning of the period

Remark
Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying rate and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at 12 percent annual interest, use 12%/12 for rate and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for rate and 4 for nper.
