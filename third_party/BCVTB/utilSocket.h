/// This file provides methods that allow clients to
/// establish a socket connection. Clients typically call
/// the method \c establishclientsocket()
/// once, and then call the method 
/// \c exchangedoubleswithsocket() in each time step.
/// At the end of the simulation, a client should call
/// \c closeipc() to close the socket connection.
/// These three functions are the only functions that are
/// needed to interface a client to the BCVTB.
