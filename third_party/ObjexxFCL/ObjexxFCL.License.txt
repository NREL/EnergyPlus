Software License Agreement for the Objexx Fortran-C++ Library

The following License Agreement applies to any user of the Objexx Fortran-C++
Library (ObjexxFCL). By use of the software, you indicate your acceptance of the
following Software License Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this
Agreement, promptly return any media and printed materials to Objexx
Engineering, Inc. for a full refund.

1. This is a legal agreement between Objexx Engineering, Inc. ("Licensor") and
the Licensee, who is being licensed to use the Objexx Fortran-C++ Library
computer software and associated documentation ("Software").

2. Licensee acknowledges that this is only a limited nonexclusive license.
Licensor is and remains the owner of all titles, rights, and interests in the
Software. The Software is protected by United States copyright laws and
international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the Software like
any other copyrighted material except as otherwise provided for in this License.

3. This License permits use of the Software solely with Licensee's computer
software Applications for which the Software was licensed. Neither Licensee nor
any other party may use the Software for another purpose without licensing the
Software for that use from Licensor.

4. This License permits Licensee to make an unlimited number of copies of the
Software and to install the Software on more than one computer system for its
own use with the Applications. Licensee may modify the Software for use in the
Applications without additional licensing but may not remove the Licensor
copyright notice from the Software, charge a fee for the Software, or otherwise
imply or assert ownership of the Software. Modifications made by Licensee to
the Software for Licensee's use may be attributed to but not copyrighted by
Licensee and do not preclude Licensor from including similar or identical
modifications in a future version of the Software, falling under Licensor
copyright. The purpose of this provision is to prevent the Licensee's ability
to modify the Software, creating a derived work of the Software, from limiting
the Licensor's ability to extend the Software's capabilities.

5. This License permits Licensee to include and distribute the Software in
source or binary form with current and future versions of the Applications
without limitation and without payment to Licensor. Within the limitations of
the Applications' licensing, those parties may modify the Software for use in
the Applications subject to the same conditions as apply to Licensee.

6. This License applies to any other versions or extensions of the Software
provided by Licensor to Licensee unless a different License is agreed upon by
Licensor and Licensee.

7. This License is your proof of license to exercise the rights granted herein
and must be retained by you. You may not rent or lease the Software, but you
may transfer the Software and user documentation on a permanent basis with the
sale or transfer of any of the Applications provided the recipient agrees to the
terms of this Agreement.

8. This Software is subject to a limited warranty. Licensor warrants to
Licensee that any physical medium on which this Software is distributed is free
from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and to the best of
Licensor's knowledge Licensee's use of this Software according to the
documentation is not an infringement of any third party's intellectual property
rights. This limited warranty lasts for a period of 90 days after delivery. No
agent of Licensor is authorized to make any other warranties or to modify this
limited warranty. Any action for breach of this limited warranty must be
commenced within one year of the expiration of the warranty. Because some
jurisdictions do not allow any limit on the length of an implied warranty, the
above limitation may not apply to this Licensee. If the law does not allow
disclaimer of implied warranties, then any implied warranty is limited to 90
days after delivery of the Software to Licensee. Licensee has specific legal
rights pursuant to this warranty and, depending on Licensee's jurisdiction, may
have additional rights.

9. Licensor DOES NOT WARRANT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET
YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR FREE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE
IS WITH YOU. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Licensor AND
ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE AND THE ACCOMPANYING
WRITTEN MATERIALS. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU
MAY HAVE OTHERS WHICH VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

10. THE SOFTWARE IS INTENDED TO BE USED ONLY BY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS AND IS
NOT TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, TESTING, SAFETY AND UTILITY.
Licensor IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY RESULTS OBTAINED FROM USING THE
SOFTWARE.

11. In case of a breach of the Limited Warranty, Licensee's exclusive remedy is
as follows: Licensee will return all copies of the Software to Licensor, at
Licensee's cost, along with proof of purchase. (Licensee can obtain a
step-by-step explanation of this procedure by contacting Licensor at Objexx
Engineering, Inc., 192 South Street, Needham MA 02492, USA by mail
or by telephoning 1.781.455.1150.) At Licensor's option, Licensor will either
send Licensee a replacement copy of the Software, at Licensor's expense, or
issue a full refund.

12. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY
DAMAGES, INCLUDING COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, CONNECTED WITH OR RESULTING FROM THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT
OR LICENSEE'S USE OF THIS SOFTWARE. Licensee's jurisdiction may not allow such
a limitation of damages, so this limitation may not apply.

13. To the extent allowed by Commonwealth of Massachusetts Law, Licensee agrees
to defend and indemnify Licensor and hold Licensor harmless from all claims,
losses, damages, complaints, or expenses connected with or resulting from
Licensee's business operations.

14. Licensor may terminate this License Agreement upon notice if Licensee is in
material breach of this Agreement and fails within thirty (30) days of a written
demand for performance to cure such breach.

15. Licensee agrees to return to Licensor or to destroy all copies of the
Software upon termination of the License.

16. This License Agreement is the entire and exclusive agreement between
Licensor and Licensee regarding this Software. This License Agreement replaces
and supersedes all prior negotiations, dealings, and agreements between Licensor
and Licensee regarding this Software.

Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of
the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013

Rights at 48 CFR 52.227-19, as applicable. Manufacturer is Objexx Engineering,

18. This License Agreement is governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, United States of America. Jurisdiction of any disputes shall be
in the courts of Massachusetts and you hereby submit to the personal
jurisdiction of said courts. Should any of the provisions of this License be
declared invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the balance of the
License will remain in full force and effect.

19. This License Agreement is valid without Licensor's signature. It becomes
effective upon the earlier of Licensee's signature or Licensee's use of the
Software.
