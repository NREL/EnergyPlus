 * Column-major factorization of form
 *   A = P * L * U

 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                       Order == CblasRowMajor
 * Row-major factorization of form
 *   A = P * L * U
 * where P is a column-permutation matrix, L is lower triangular (lower
 * trapazoidal if M > N), and U is upper triangular with unit diagonals (upper
 * trapazoidal if M < N).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Let IERR be the return value of the function:
 *    If IERR == 0, successful exit.
 *    If (IERR < 0) the -IERR argument had an illegal value
 *    If (IERR > 0 && Order == CblasColMajor)
 *       U(i-1,i-1) is exactly zero.  The factorization has been completed,
 *       but the factor U is exactly singular, and division by zero will
 *       occur if it is used to solve a system of equations.
 *    If (IERR > 0 && Order == CblasRowMajor)
 *       L(i-1,i-1) is exactly zero.  The factorization has been completed,
 *       but the factor L is exactly singular, and division by zero will
