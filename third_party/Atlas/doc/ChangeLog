ATLAS 3.10.2 released 07/10/14, highlights of changes from 3.10.1
   * Fixed all errataed bugs:
     + Failure to init workspace can cause NaNs in SYRK
     + Complex row-major Q-type factorizations produce bad TAU
     + Failure to cast causes integer overflow on 64-byt platforms
     + Missing IBM S390 assembly file
   * Fixed Make.bin to have threaded latime built to do parallel cache flushing
   * Extended extract string lengths as patched by SAGE folks
   * Backported fixes & some arch support to configure framework, including
     host of Itanium and UST1 stuff provided by SAGE folks
   NOTE: 3.10.2 is terribly out of date, and was released only because the
      threading rewrite it taking too long.  If possible, you should use a
      developer release after testing that it works for your particular
      platform.  In particular, developer releases are *much* faster for any
      x86 that uses AVX or later SIMD ISA, or any machine with ncores >= 8.
      The developer release also supports ARM architectures better (though
      performance is not hugely better if you can get stable installed).

ATLAS 3.9.37 released 02/15/11, changes from 3.9.36:
   * Fixed bug in all L2 kernel timers where timing loop not even entered,
     resulting in bogus time being returned
   * Fixed bug in gmmsearch.c; lat was set to bad value after K-unroll search
   * Added xtune_spawn_fp to study spawning strategies under load
ATLAS 3.9.36 released 02/13/11, changes from 3.9.35:
   * ATLAS now only uses affinity when it provides speedup (empirically tuned)
   * Fixed bug in all ATL_PAFF_SELF implementations of affinity

   * Fixed numerous bugs relating to transpose & row-major interface in
     GBMV and GEMV.
   * Fixed bugs involving aligning Y and applying BETA in ATL_gemvCN.
   * Fixed bugs in SYR2 and GER, where N-cleanup was calling the Mlt func,
     rather than the Nlt/axpy func, and using an index of 'N' rather than 'n'.
ATLAS 3.9.34 released 02/06/11, changes from 3.9.33:
   * First release from github basefiles
   * Affinity now auto-probed for instead of assumed (tested only Linux).
     -> If affinity works on P=0, probes for all legal affinity IDs
   * Implemented serial & dynamic launch; serial is best most of time
     - On PPC, dynamic & log2 are faster with P=32
   * Several threading-related probes added to ATLAS/tune/threads
   * Added -m64/-m32 to flags on POWER7 and POWER6
   * Addition of AtomicCount routines for later threading use.

   * Large number of bug patches reported by Tom Wallace applied
   * Important bug patches submitted by Mike Kistler for L2 tuning:
     - Allowing prefetch tuning flags when C flags not specified
     - Allow timings to work in the face of low-resolution timers
   * Cast threading BLAS indexing to size_t to avoid overflow
   * Rewrite of lapack libs, so we have threaded/serial versions.
     - Now liblapack.a and libptlapack.a!
   * Addition of PCA codes for LU and QR, but not yet used by default
   * Added section on ATLAS coding style to ATLAS/doc/atlas_devel.pdf
   * Rewrite of dynamic lib build, so they always build one monolithic lib:
     - libtatlas.[so,dylib,dll] : threaded lapack, threaded blas
     - libsatlas.[so,dylib,dll] : serial lapack, serial blas
   * Updated P4ESSE3 and PPCG564AltiVec arch defs
ATLAS 3.9.32 released 11/02/10, changes from 3.9.31:
   * Fixed error in ATL_cgemvN_8x4_sse3.c, causing seg fault if BETA=0
     - Updated arch defs for Core264SSE & AMD64K10h64SSE3
ATLAS 3.9.31 released 10/29/10, changes from 3.9.30:
   * Made it so L2 searches print out error output on fatal kernel tests or
     failed timings
   * Made it so that unrestricted L2 timings force all operands to be aligned
     to sizeof(TYPE) (and no greater), in order to get real worst-case 
     performance for vector codes.
   * Fixed L2 timers so they allow complex arrays to be aligned to underlying
     type size, rather than full complex size
   * New L2 archdefs using improved timers for:
     + Core264SSE3, AMD64K10h64SSE3, Corei764SSE3
ATLAS 3.9.30 released 10/28/10, changes from 3.9.29:
   * Made it so prefetchw is not tried by l2searches if 3DNow! is not detected
   * Fixed error in AMD64K10h64SSE3 arch defs causing incomplete timings
   * Had Level 2 BLAS use serial cacheedge rather than parallel
ATLAS 3.9.29 released 10/27/10, changes from 3.9.28:
   * Removed workspace error check from all QR variant interface routs

     with the diagonal elements conjugated from what they should have been
   * Fixed error in neg files used in "make ArchNew"
   * Updated architectural defaults for Corei764SSE3
   * Fixed error in AMD64K10h64SSE3 arch defs causing negative "make time"
ATLAS 3.9.28 released 10/25/10, changes from 3.9.27:
   * Several changes so that dynamic libs will build w/o missing symbols:
     + Changed SPR, HPR so they just call the reference packed blas.
     + Removed prototypes for MV kernels that no longer exist from atlas_lvl2.h
     + Removed build of src/blas/level2/kernel, since no longer needed
   * Fixed all L2 kernel searches so TimeMyKernel returns mflop rate
   * Fixed bug in ATL_sgemvN_8x4_sse.c where $Y$ was read when BETA=0
   * Changed it so generated Makefiles for mvN, mvT, r1, r2 kerenls use GOODGCC
     if 'gcc' is specified (so they inherit flags like -pg, -m64, etc).
   * Added VSX GER from Mike Kistler to kernels & Power7 arch defs
ATLAS 3.9.27 released 10/20/10, changes from 3.9.26:
   * Fixed several bugs to allow L2 BLAS to install using a low-res timer

   * Fixed bug so that h2gen.c generates ATL_GENGERK as a function that
     can handle all operations, not just least restricted kernel.
   * Fixed bug in ATL_syr & syr2 where nr computed incorrectly
   * Fixed cblas_[nrm2,asum,iamax,scal] so that they return with no
     operations if incX < 1 (this matches f77 behavior)
   * Fixed bug with extra spaces in configure's OSX libtool finding script
ATLAS 3.9.26 released 10/18/10, changes from 3.9.25:
   * Much improved GEMV & GER performance for x86-64:
     + Addition of SSE/x86-64 GER/GEMV generators
     + Complete rewrite of GEMV tuning infrastructure
     + Change to GER kernel API to minimize parameter passing
     + Arch defaults for Core264SSE3 & AMD64K10h64SSE3 updated
   * ANSI C code generators for MVT, MVN, R1 and R2.
     + should improve non-x86/x86-64 performance
   * Started rewrite of all L2BLAS:
     + GEMVT, GEMVN, GER, SYR, SYR2, HER, HER2 built from optimized kernels
     - TRMV, TRSV, SYMV, HEMV just call reference implementation
   * Bug fixes:
     + Fixed kernel testers & timers to correctly handle alignments,
       particularly ALIGNX2A.
   * Basic support for POWER7
     + VSX detection
     + VSX GEMM, GEMVN & GEMVT kernels provided by Mike Kistler of IBM
     + Arch defs

   * Fixed bug causing x_tfindCE/txover to use CPU rather than WALL time
   * Got rid of test -e in Makefiles, since Solaris /bin/sh disallows

   * Fixed typos when setting self affinity in threading (SunOS)
   * Fixed R1SUMM/R1K.sum error in ArchNew target for creating arch defs 
   * Added R2K.sum files to archdef Makefile, and to Core264 & k10h64 arch defs.
   * Added configure support for UltraSPARC T2
     + Turned off affinity for T2, where it decreases parallel performance
   * Added architectural defaults for UST264 & UST232
   * Fixed errors in GER2 handling
   * Fixed repeated GER/GER2 symbols that prevented shared lib build
ATLAS 3.9.24 released 04/21/10, changes from 3.9.23:

   * Addition of new BLAS2.5-like kernel, GER2 (rank-2 update)
     - A = alpha*x*y + beta*w*z + A
   * Native ATLAS support for xGELS and all subsidiary routines, including
     C and Fortran interfaces for GELS 
     - Internal routs not yet exposed in C/F77 iface include:
       + ORM[[QL,QR,LQ,RQ]  -> UNM* called ORM for complex
       + GE[QL,QR,LQ,RQ]2 (unblocked QR)
       + GE[QL,QR,LQ,RQ]R (recursive QR)
       + LADIV, LAPY2, LAPY3
       + LARFB, LARFT (F77 ifaces, but no C ifaces)
       + LARF, LARFG, LARFP
       + LASCL (not supported for banded matrices)
     - Of these, should definitely expose UNM/ORM at iface level
   * Addition of [D,S]LAMCH for both C & F77 interfaces
   * Fixed slvtst (LU & QR) to use norm of original A, not factored matrix
     in computing solve residual
   * Chad fixed a bug in the SSE generator in type casting for stores
   * Changed it so unknown LAPACK routs are given ATLAS's NB for NB, 
     rather than 1
   * Fixed bug in r1hgen.c where Level 1 & 2 blocking were hugely inflated
     (leading to no effective blocking)
   * Updated archinfo_linux to recognize "PPC970MP" as a G5
ATLAS 3.9.23 released 02/07/10, changes from 3.9.22:
   * Fixed dependency error in ATLAS/makes/Make.mmtune
   * Improved mmflagsearch, so we now have O(N) greedy search as default
     -> if you pass -f gcc, will gen most opt-related gcc flags in gccflags.txt
   * Improved flags used on PowerPC G4 & G5
   * Updated some architectural defaults:
     - Corei764SSE3, PPCG564AltiVec, PPCG4AltiVec, MIPSICE964
ATLAS 3.9.22 released 02/05/10, changes from 3.9.21
   * Fixed long-standing bug in cleanup code generation -- this bug has been
     in package since we've generated cleanup, and it causes malformed ifs
     that select cleanup code; most commonly it creates uncompilable code,
     but it could also result in using a suboptimal cleanup kernel.
   * Fixed another long-standing bug in cleanup code generation, this
     one involving not building enough fixed=1 clean cases if there are
     higher imult cleanup cases in the Q.  This resulted in errors in
     cleanup answers.
   * Complete rewrite of search for finding best generated kernel to use
     new test/time infrastructure.  See ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/gmmsearch for
     new search.  Cleanup and no-copy still uses old search, which is renamed
     ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/mmcuncpsearch.c.  New search driver is mmsearch.c
   * Chad fixed several bugs in the SSE generator relating to type casting
   * Fixed genparse's DupString to handle NULL pointers
   * Fixed erroneous include of atlas_misc.h in clapack.h
   * Added a compiler flag search to ease job of finding good flags.
     - ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/mmflagsearch.c
   * Arch def changes:
     - Updated G4 defs -- reduced perf due to gcc PPC performance bug
     - Corei7464SSE3: negated ?MMRES.sum mflop values
     - AMD64K10h64SSE3 : updated to new style
     - Core264SSE3 : updated to new style
   * Some PowerPC-specific fixes:
     - Fixed it so configure can autodetect clock speed on G4/Linux
     - Fixed it so ATLAS always assumes gnu gcc altivec handling on PowerPC
     - Renamed vector registers to numbers just like GPRs (fixes Linux/PPC 
       assembly, and related altivec probe)
ATLAS 3.9.21 released 01/11/10, changes from 3.9.20
   * Fixed error in threaded SYMM, where recursion had bad pointer
   * Created ability to tune threaded/serial crossover points, see
        ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/txover.c
   * Improved CacheEdge detection
   * Fixed bug in configure for --shared on archs w/o f77 compiler
   * Updated lanbtst to work wt new QR naming scheme, and to compile
     correctly for lanbtime (was not using lapack's ILAENV in this case)
ATLAS 3.9.20 released 12/21/09, changes from 3.9.19
   * Fixed bug in call to memcpy by casting all MulBySize to size_t
   * Fixed several ilaenv-related errors, including QR always using serial parms
   * Made it so ORMQR and UNMQR variants use QR's tuned NB
   * Fixed error in complex gemoveT & gemoveC (src/auxil)
   * Made gemoveT & C TLB-aware
   * Added src/auxil/ATL_sqtrans to do TLB-aware in-place square transpose
   * If M==N, then RQ & LQ (row-major) do in-place transpose and call
     QL or QR (column-major).  This gives ~10% performance improvement.
   * Added F77 interface for xLARFT and xLARFB
ATLAS 3.9.19 released 12/08/09, changes from 3.9.18
   * Got rid of files in C2F now being provided natively by ATLAS:

   * Fixed duplication of unmqr_wrk symbols
   * Removed use of SAFMIN global variable in larfb/larfg
ATLAS 3.9.18 released 12/05/09, changes from 3.9.17
   * Found & fixed error in threaded GEMM
   * Fixed bug where lanbtst_pt didn't set NB
   * Modified mmksearch_sse.c to try gcc & sse flags if native compiler
     can't handle the generated files.
   * Rewrote LAPACK/QR NB tuning
     - now uses ATLAS/tune/lapack/lanbsrch rather than bin/lanbtst (faster)
     - Now done by default
   * Numerous errors fixed involving architecture default timing (all levels)
   * Modified atlas_install to keep track of times for every part of install,
     so we can see where time is spent
   * Architectural default related changes:
     - Fixed ArchNew target in building arch defs to negate .sum files
     - Core264SSE & AMD64K10h64SSE needed negative values in .sum files
     - Updated Core264SSE, AMD64K10h64SSE, HAMMER64SSE3 to get new threaded
       lapack, and full .sum support
ATLAS 3.9.17 released 11/15/09, changes from 3.9.16
   * Chad's SSE GEMM generator now works for CGEMM
     - Provides faster (CGEMM) arch defs for Core264SSE3
   * Addition of householder factorizations (mostly written by Siju Samuel):
     - F77 & C interface, C supports row/col- major
     - GEQRF GEQLF GERQF GELQF
     - tester is qrtst.c in ATLAS/bin/
     - Retuned LAPACK's QR NB arch defs for AMD64K10h64SSE3 & Core264SSE3
   * Fixed seg fault in ummsearch caused by mmksearch_sse failure
   * Rewrote Write[MM,MV,R1]File to get around gcc bug

ATLAS 3.9.15 released 10/10/09, changes from 3.9.14
   * Addition of Chad Zalkin's SSE GEMM generator to ATLAS
   * Support for external searches and use of standard matmul search routs in:
     - include/atlas_mmparse.h
     - include/atlas_mmtesttime.h
   * Numerous search changes to incorporate above in ATLAS matmul install
     - Changed matmul install to be much quieter
ATLAS 3.9.14 released 08/19/09 (bugfix release), changes from 3.9.13
   * Fixed complex indexing errors in ATL_ger.c & ATL_zgerk_1x4_sse3.c
   * Fixed error in config.c where using LAPACK caused OpenMP to be built
   * Made it so C2F LAPACK interface only built if F77 LAPACK is provided
   * Basic --shared install now works (tested Linux build only)
ATLAS 3.9.13 released 08/17/09 (bugfix release), changes from 3.9.12
   * Fixed ATL_smm14x1x84_sseCU.c so it won't be used when NB > 84
     - fixed AMD64 arch def not to use it
   * Fixed 1-character memory overwrite in atlas_genparse.h's DupString
   * Added prototype to r1ktest.c
   * 3.9.12 showed version of 3.9.11; this version shows correct 3.9.13
ATLAS 3.9.12 released 08/06/09, changes from 3.9.11
   * Complete rewrite of GER, SYR/HER and SYR2/HER2:
     - New tuning mechinism tunes GER for in-L1, in-L2, and out-of-cache
       * Call ATL_<pre>ger_L1 if data known to be in L1 cache
       * Call ATL_<pre>ger_L2 if data known to be in L2 cache
     - Most architectures now lack GER arch defs
       * Provided GER archdefs 64-bit K10h and Core2
     - atlas_devel not yet updated
   * Relatively untested standard timing/tester code available for all
     tuned kernels (GER fairly well tested)
     - atlas_[mv,r1,mm]parse.h reads standard input/output files
     - atlas_[mv,r1,mm]testtime.h provides tester/timer calls for kernels
   * Can compile both lapack 3.2 and 3.1 with --with-netlib-lapack-tarfile
     - Removed support for other ways of building lapack
     - atlas_install mostly updated

     - Fixed C/Z GEMM JITcp bug where C was read when BETA=0
     - Fixed threaded LAPACK calling serial ilaenv  (QR speedup)
ATLAS 3.9.11 released 04/07/09, changes from 3.9.10
   * Added flags -Si [omp,antthr] 0/1/2 to allow ease of building ATLAS
     with alternative threading implementations
   * Fixed prototypes in atlas_f77wrap.h so that all thread interfaces
     are properly prototyped when they are selected by the above flags
   * Fixed missing TRMM prototype in atlas_tlvl3.h that caused STRSM
     to fail tests in xsl3blastst_pt
ATLAS 3.9.10 released 03/11/09, changes from 3.9.9
   * Rewrote tgemm's combine routine to work on arbitrary partitionings 
     combined in arbitrary orders (necessary for non-power-of-2 processors)
     - Restricted fix for SYRK (not general, as it isn't needed yet)
   * Fixed bug in EnforceNonPwr2LO caused by failure to rename moved
     structure in the Cinfp array
   * Fixed makefile problem that caused ATLAS to re-archive the L3BLAS for
     every tester compile
   * On windows, added -lkernel32 to LIBS macro to enable shared lib build
ATLAS 3.9.9 released 02/26/09, changes from 3.9.8
   * Fixed bug in Xtsyrk's ATL_tsyrkdecomp_K, both on when the algorithm
     is used, and correctness for when K is not large enough to give all
     processors NB of work.
   * Fixed bug in lanbtst, where single precision (S/C) used double values
     rather than single values when determining workspace requirements
   * Changed atlas_install to have a final library build phase
     - Was not rebuilding lib after post-build tuning
       -> Caused lapack and poss other files to be untuned unless user rebuilds
          by invoking tester/timer for each subpiece
       -> Caused dynamic libs to be built from badly tuned libs
   * Added missing lapack arch defs for Corei764 and MIPSICE9
ATLAS 3.9.8 released 02/23/09, changes from 3.9.7
   * Fixed bug in ATL_Xtgemm where ATL_thrdecompMM failed to return the
     number of processors on non-power-of-2 processor systems
   * Fixed bug in ATL_tsyrk where I was calling the K-splitting routine
     when the required workspace was large, rather than when it was small.
   * Fixed analagous problem in ATL_tsyrk as the 3.9.7 did for ATL_tgemm;
     however, tsyrk bug could not have been exercised by current decomposition.
   * Introduced some fixes & workarounds for SiCortex/MIPSICE9:
     - Changed default MIPSICE9 compiler back to gcc, since pathcc produces
       bad ATL_tsyrk when optimization is above -O1 (confirmed compiler error)
   * Added dependence on atlas_ptalias3.h in cblas interface Makefile.
ATLAS 3.9.7 released 02/20/09, changes from 3.9.6:
   * Fixed bug in ATL_tgemm that caused seg faults for some small-M tGEMMs
   * Added architectural defaults for K7323DNow (Athlon "classic")
ATLAS 3.9.6 released 02/01/09, Changes from 3.9.5:
   * Made it so LAPACK is tuned specifically for threading as well as for serial
     - Added threaded lapack arch defs for:
       + Core264SSE3, P4E64SSE3, Corei764SSE3
   * Made it so LAPACK NB-tuning is mu/nu aware
   * MIPSICE9 (sicortex) improvements:
     - added pathcc arch defs
     - updated gcc arch defs to better values
     --> Still getting errors on this platform
   * Some bug fixes:
     - Detect model 29 as Core2
     - Rewrote ptFlushAreasByCL to use new thread framework
     - Fixed handling of non-power-of-2 number of threads
     - Better dependencies for building ilaenv
ATLAS 3.9.5 released 12/11/08, Changes from 3.9.4:
   * Complete rewrite of ATLAS threading system:
     - Now supports native windows threads in addition to pthreads
     - Use of master-last and affinity increases threaded performance, with
       an advantage that grows with P (almost no advantage for P=2, but for
       instance LU is more than 60% faster asymptotically on a P=8 Core2)
       + OS X and FreeBSD don't support processor affinity, and so their
         performance is still bad
     - Cacheedge specifically tuned for threading (another 5%)
   * Changed emit_buildinfo so that it replaces all control characters with
     spaces (prevents errors under windows).
   * Added dependency info for ATL_ilaenv so that it is recompiled once 
     lapack tuning is complete
   * Fixed error in configure where it issues commands in wrong directory
     when the user builds lapack directly from a tarfile
   * Fixed typos in config.c where I used 'comp' rather than 'comps'.
   * Added mmtime_pt.c, which can allow us to find kernels that do well
     in parallel operation.
   * Various small configure fixes for windows
ATLAS 3.9.4 released 09/06/08, Changes from 3.9.3:
   * Improved Windows/cygwin configure with addition of archinfo_win.c
   * Added basic support for Windows/interix
     - Did not pursue much due to widespread seg fault in gcc, hundreds of
       hard-to-get "hot fixes", and ancient gnu tools that can't assemble SSE3
   * Removed special "no-need-to-copy" cases from ATLmm_JIK/IJK.c, since they
     occasionally seem to cause large performance drops.
   * Changed it so JIK matmul always called for rank-K update, in order to
     reduce access costs on C.
   * Fixed several errors in ATLAS's ILAENV.
   * Fixed several errors in configure
   * Fixed error when -Ss lasrc is given as relative rather than absolute path
   * Added BETA support for auto-building shared/dynamic libraries when the
     user passes --shared to configure (no need to explicitly set compiler
     flags [eg., -fPIC] for any of the known compilers):
     - Not fully tested, but appears to work for Windows, OS X and Linux
     - Now referenced in make install, but present process is crude
     - with --nof77, get clapack reather than lapack; eventually probably want
       a logical link of lapack
ATLAS 3.9.3 released 08/13/08, Changes from 3.9.2:
   * Added much more extensive testing capability:
     - make full_test  /  make scope_full_test
       + Added Antoine's testing scripts to ATLAS.  Just do a "make full_test"
         to run them ("make full_test_nh" to use nohup for remove connection).
     - make lapack_test[a,s,f]l_[ab,sb,fb,pt] / make scope_lapack_test_?l_??

ATLAS 3.9.0 released 07/17/08, Changes from 3.8.2:
   * Added ATLAS/bin/lanbtst.c, which can be used to time lapack routines,
     as well as tune the NB returned by ILEANV
     - Ability to autotune LAPACK QR factorization performance by varying NB
       + Added QR NB choice header files to Core2Duo arch defs
   * Started producing standard C wrappers for F77LAPACK.  See:
        ATLAS/include/C_lapack.h
   * Much improved DGEMM performance for Core2Duo and AMD K10h
   * Configure improvements:
     - Added '--with-netlib-lapack-tarfile' and '-Ss lasrc' flags to configure

   * Fixed bug in configure causing Pentium-M to be IDed as CoreDuo
   * Fixed bug in tfc.c causing memory overwrite when too many samples taken
   * Improved L1 BLAS timers so they work like the rest of the package, and
     thus don't die all the time on tolerance failures
   * Improved ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/mmsearch.c:
     - for x86, tried more registers, since smart compiler can reduce A & B
       regs to 2 (and possibly even 1)
     - Made it so search tries both load-C-at-top and load-C-at-bottom of
       M loop.  Bottom is superior for error, and ATLAS originally defaulted
       to load-C-at-top.
   * Added configure support for new K10h platform from AMD, as well as
     basic architectural defaults (no new kernels, just good search)

       G5/PowerPC970, POWER4, POWER5, etc.
     - Better handling of long-thin matrices (K >> M,N) and rank-K, K<=4 shapes
     - Improved complex performance on some platforms
     - Further reduced error on some platforms 
       + ATLAS error bound always <= reference BLAS before reduction

     - Had to remove all constant divides in integer expressions in assembly,
       as Sun geniuses decided to change comment character to '/'
       + \/ is supposed to work, but doesn't
     - Had to touch every x86 assembly file to change assembly comments to /**/
ATLAS 3.7.32 released 04/27/07, changes from 3.7.31:
   * Adapted MIPS double prec kernel to single
   * Added 32-bit support (n32) to MIPS (assembly & config)

   * Fixed bug in atlas_prefetch found by David Cournapeau.
   * Added MIPSICE9 prefetch option, d/zgemm assembly kernels and arch defaults.
     - These should work on most MIPS platforms 
     - Assembly kernels work under IRIX, but no way to get cc to do prefetch
       + could not make cc's pragma work with ATLAS's atlas_prefetch defs
   * Added support for OSX/PowerPC970:
     - Double precision assembly kernel getting 82.5% of peak (4*Mhz)
     - Single precision assembly kernel getting 79% of peak (8*Mhz)

     - fixed dynamic lib link for f77 interface libs
     - Updated L1 kernel testers in tune/ for function routs to call the test
       func first (so correct answer not on stack), and to check for NaN
     - Fixed it so error report genned again.
     - Fixed error causing real JITcp to copy all the time, and then fixed
       error in func ptr when this was selected.
   * Wrote special Just In Time Copy (JITcp) gemm for complex that copies A&B
     a block at a time, and calls the real kernel for complex matmul
     - Speeds up large-case z/cgemm on some platforms (5-10%)
     - Speeds up long-K case for some platforms (as much as doubles perf)
   * Fixed miscalculation of CacheEdge, where I stopped using it for large K.
     This fix reduces memory usage, and speeds up asymptotic case a bit.
ATLAS 3.7.29 released 02/28/07, changes from 3.7.28:
   * Wrote special routines (mmBPP and mmMNK) for handling small M, N and 
     large K case.  For M = N <= NB can double performance.  Presently works
     for real precisions (s,d) only.
   * Translated x87 Athlon-64 kernel to 32-bit assembly.
   * Put in special code to handle SYRK call to GEMM by calling SYRK and
     reflecting the triangular matrix.  Doubles speed, and avoid fp error
     on reflection.

     - Can specify flags to be appended to gcc in user-contributed index files
     - Can append flags to only C compilers
     - Can append flags to only C+usergcc, all+usergcc, etc.
   * Configure now recognizes gnu compilers as gnu compiler regardless of
     compiler name when looking for default flags for user-override compilers
ATLAS 3.7.26 released 01/30/07, changes from 3.7.25:
   * Added line to all assembly files to declare them as not requiring an
     executable stack for Linux (apparently, lack broke SELinux).
   * Numerous assembly fixes, particularly forced use of .text and asmdecor
     in all x86 assembly files.
   * Fixed dnrm2's to call sqrtl to avoid gcc round-down.
ATLAS 3.7.25 released 01/22/07, changes from 3.7.24:
   * Added x87 nrm2 assembly kernels to avoid gcc probs, changed old 
     gcc-compiled nrm21 kernels to use double native precision for
     accumulator (breaks dnrm2 due to gcc's spurious round-down).
   * Changed Athlon64 and Core2Duo arch defaults to use load-at-bottom gemm
     kernels, which should reduce GEMM error
   * Changed configure to error out if ran in ATLAS source directory.
   * Changed all ATLAS/doc postscript files to .pdf

ATLAS 3.7.21 released 11/18/06, changes from 3.7.20:
   * Made gemm call axpy-based GEMM when K < 4 && M >= 40 and
     no-copy code would be used -- should help bottom of LU recursion perf
   * Changed it so all F2C probes linked by Fortran do all I/O in Fortran,
     instead of printing from C (some platforms seem to have problems
     redirecting C I/O from a Fortran-linked program).
   * Several bug fixes
   * Added config support for solaris install
ATLAS 3.7.20 released 11/11/06, changes from 3.7.19:
   * Added ability to use Cij = instead of Cij += on first iteration of loop
     in emit_mm.c:
     - Max K unrolling where this is done is set by cpp macro MAX_CASG_KU
       to avoid code bloat (always works for full unroll)
     - For muladd=1, doesn't work if K is unknown at compile-time
     - Speeds up load-at-bottom and beta=0 code
   * Added ability to prefetch C when prefA selected and doing load-at-bottom
     or beta=0.  Gives nice speedup on HammerX2, need to test other machines
   * Added -falign-loops=4 to x87-using flags 
     - big speedup on Hammer, need to test on Intel
   * Several bug fixes to allow config/install to work on OSX/Core2Duo:
     - Fixed userindex so that it substitutes $(GOODGCC) for gcc in .SSE & .3DN
       files as well as in .flg
     - Made user override of 64 bits switch the probed assembly if it was
       probed to be x8632
     - Fixed freebsd archinfo syntax error (typo in code that fixed overflow).

     to use them
   * Fixed a couple more assembly files to work with OS X
   * User can now successfully override 32/64 bit choice on the configure
     line using -b [32,64].

       is overridden by the user on the configure line
     - Fixed error in userflag.c
     - Fixed lack of ' ' around C compiler names in GEMM files
     - After probes finished in config, made 32-bit override change detected
       asmb to 32 if it was presently 64
ATLAS 3.7.18 released 10/12/06, changes from 3.7.17:
   * Bugfix release only:
     - Fixed configure so that multiple compiler flags can be passed to config.
     - Adapted x86 assembly kernels in Level 1 & src directories so that they
       will also run under OS X
     - Added needed #define to ATLAS/src/invtst.c
     - Added fix to disambiguate int & long in f77/C interface
ATLAS 3.7.17 released 09/09/06, changes from 3.7.16:

     (for users w/o fortran compiler)
ATLAS 3.7.15 released 08/22/06, changes from 3.7.14:
   * New x87 kernel that achieves over 90% of peak for double precision
     Opteron/Athlon-64.  Gemm runs at roughly same speed as old SSE kernel,
     but LU and Cholesky actually get a speedup.  The fp stack usage
     of this kernel was suggested by the new gcc.
     - New arch defaults for HAMMER64SSE[2,3]
   * Modified ILEANV so small problems aren't told to use the full ATLAS NB.

       -- Alias not working, need to check!
     - Fixed error in -Si nof77 1, which caused config to die w/o f77 compiler
   * Added new arch defaults for P4E[32,64]SSE3 and HAMMER64SSE3, which get
     better performance for gcc 4.2 (perf should still be OK for gcc 3).
ATLAS 3.7.13 released 07/26/06, changes from 3.7.12:
   * Mainly, fixes/updates to ATLAS config:

   * Completely rewrote configure handling to make ATLAS act more like
     gnu configure
     - You now build ATLAS in an arbitrary build directory
       + /path/to/ATLAS/configure ; make build ; make test
     - Read ATLAS/INSTALL.txt for directions, everything is changed!
     - Presently, only supported OSes are Linux and FreeBSD (OSX). 
       Will be adding more in subsequent developer releases.
   * Added support for prefetch in generator, mmsearch.c, fc.c, etc.

     - Added prefetch searching
     - Updated FindMUNU to suggest 1-D vals on x86 boxes (2-op assembler).
     - Made sure GetNO1D always returns false for x86 boxes (2-op assembler)
     - Added special case for large number of registers (eg. Itanium) to
       speed up munu search (searches near-square only)
       + Untested, and likely needs fixing
     - several small error-handling issues
   * Improved masearch.c & L1CacheSize.c to make loop-removal by compiler
     less likely.
