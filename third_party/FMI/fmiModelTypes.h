/* Standard header file to define the argument types of the
   functions of the Model Execution Interface.
   This header file must be utilized both by the model and
   by the simulation engine.

   Revisions:
   - Jan.  4, 2010: Renamed meModelTypes_h to fmiModelTypes_h (by Mauss, QTronic)
   - Dec. 21, 2009: Changed "me" to "fmi" and "meModel" to "fmiComponent"
                    according to meeting on Dec. 18 (by Martin Otter, DLR)
   - Dec.  6, 2009: Added meUndefinedValueReference (by Martin Otter, DLR)
   - Sept. 9, 2009: Changes according to FMI-meeting on July 21:
                    Changed "version" to "platform", "standard" to "standard32",
                    Added a precise definition of "standard32" as comment
                    (by Martin Otter, DLR)
   - July 19, 2009: Added "me" as prefix to file names, added meTrue/meFalse,
                    and changed meValueReferenced from int to unsigned int
                    (by Martin Otter, DLR).
   - March 2, 2009: Moved enums and function pointer definitions to
                    ModelFunctions.h (by Martin Otter, DLR).
   - Dec. 3, 2008 : First version by Martin Otter (DLR) and
