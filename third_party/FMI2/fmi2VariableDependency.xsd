							<xs:documentation>Defines the dependency of the Unknown (directly or indirectly via auxiliary variables) on the Knowns in Continuous-Time and Event Mode (ModelExchange) and at Communication Points (CoSimulation). If not present, it must be assumed that the Unknown depends on all Knowns. If present as empty list, the Unknown depends on none of the Knowns. Otherwise the Unknown depends on the Knowns defined by the given ScalarVariable indices. The indices are ordered according to size, starting with the smallest index.</xs:documentation>
