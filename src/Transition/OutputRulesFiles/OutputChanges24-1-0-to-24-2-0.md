Output Changes
==============

This file documents the structural changes on the output of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.

### Description

This will eventually become a more structured file, but currently it isn't clear what format is best. As an intermediate solution, and to allow the form to be formed organically, this plain text file is being used. Entries should be clearly delimited. It isn't expected that there will be but maybe a couple each release at most. Entries should also include some reference back to the repo. At least a PR number or whatever.

### EIO Internal Gains and Initialization report

For the EIO lines for:

- People Internal Gains Nominal
- Lights Internal Gains Nominal
- ElectricEquipment Internal Gains Nominal
- GasEquipment Internal Gains Nominal
- HotWaterEquipment Internal Gains Nominal
- SteamEquipment Internal Gains Nominal
- OtherEquipment Internal Gains Nominal

replaced the colums:

- Nominal Minimum 
- Nominal Maximum

with 

- Minimum for All Day Types
- Maximum for All Day Types
- Minimum for Weekdays
- Maximum for Weekdays
- Minimum for Weekends/Holidays
- Maximum for Weekends/Holidays
- Minimum for Summer Design Days
- Maximum for Summer Design Days
- Minimum for Winter Design Days
- Maximum for Winter Design Days

These changes will also make corresponding changes in the HTML Intialization Summary report


### Adding an Output:Variable, Zone/Space Wetbulb Globe Temperature

An output variable will be added at both zone and space level: Zone Wetbulb Globe Temperature, and Space Wetbulb Globe
Temperature


### EIO DX Heating Coil Standard Rating Information 

The EIO and html tabular output files now have a seprate heading and data stream for DX Heating Coils with the AHRI 2023 and prior versions.

```
! <DX Heating Coil Standard Rating Information>, Component Type, Component Name, High Temperature Heating (net) Rating Capacity {W}, Low Temperature Heating (net) Rating Capacity {W}, HSPF {Btu/W-h}, Region Number
! <DX Heating Coil AHRI 2023 Standard Rating Information>, Component Type, Component Name, High Temperature Heating (net) Rating Capacity {W}, Low Temperature Heating (net) Rating Capacity {W}, HSPF2 {Btu/W-h}, Region Number
```

### Equipment Summary Report 

Renamed a table name in the Equipment Summary report:

- from "DX Heating Coils [ HSPF2 ]" 
- to   "DX Heating Coils AHRI 2023"

Added two new columnuns to the named `DX Heating Coils AHRI 2023` table to make it equivalent to an exiting `DX Heating Coils` table. 

New columns header added:

- "Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation [C]"
- "AirLoop Name"

Renamed a column header by adding units to the `DX Heating Coils` table:

- from "Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation"
- to   "Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation [C]"

  
### Update Headers in EIO and existing tabular reports for Equipment Ratings

EIO updated for the following:

- The existing 'DX Cooling Coil Standard Rating Information' table was previously reporting ratings for both the 2017 and 2023 ratings defined by AHRI.  This is corrected by splitting the report into two tables.
- Existing table: 'DX Cooling Coil Standard Rating Information' -- This table reports Standard Ratings defined in the AHRI standard 210/240-2017 and AHRI standard 340/360-2017.
- New table: 'DX Cooling Coil AHRI 2023 Standard Rating Information' to report updated standard ratings defined in AHRI standard 210/240-2023 and AHRI standard 340/360-2022

Headers updated for the following existing tables in the HTML summary report:

- 'DX Cooling Coil Standard Ratings 2017'
- 'DX Cooling Coil Standard Ratings 2023'

See Pull Request [#10311](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/10311) for more detail

EXTRA NOTE: As a follow-up to this work, the EIO/tabular ratings tables were cleaned up to avoid duplicated table names and mismatches between the word Rating and Rated.
More information can be found in PR [#10597](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/10597)
 
 
### EnvelopeSummary in Tabular Reports

In the Opaque Exterior table added �Zone� column

Add an entirely new table called Opaque Construction Layers which shows the layers of materials for each construction


###	EquipmentSummary in Tabular Reports

In the DX Heating Coils table added "Supplemental Heat High Shutoff Temperature�

In the Fans table added "Motor Loss Zone Name"

Added an entirely new table called Air Terminals


###	SystemSummary in Tabular Reports

In the Demand Controlled Ventilation table added the "type"

Added an entirely new table called Thermostat Schedules

### New HVAC Topology report in Tabular Reports

The HVAC Topology report provides information about the arrangement of HVAC components in the supply and demand side of the airloop, zone equipment, and plant loop. Each row shows the additional component, sub-component, or sub-sub-component being added to the arrangement. 

### New Space Sizing Output File (spsz)
When space sizing is active (ZoneAirHeatBalanceAlgorithm, "Do Space Heat Balance for Sizing=Yes") a new space sizing (spsz) output file is created, similar to the existing zone sizing (zsz) output. A new field "Output Space Sizing" has been added to OutputControl:Files to control this file.

See pull request [#10566](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/10566) for more details.
