======================================

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.

# Object Changes: BASIC STRUCTURE

PR number, description of changes, etc.
Enough information that someone can build a transition tool around it.
Focus on the fields in order from 1 to N.
The alpha/numeric A/N numbers are not as important here.

# Object Change: ObjectStartsWithA

# Object Change: AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem
Field 39 (A23) No Load Supply Air Flow Rate Control Set To Low Speed is inserted. The remaining fields are shifted down. If the cooling or heating coil is Coil:*:DX:VariableSpeed the field is Yes, otherwise No.

# Object Change: ObjectStartsWithB

# Object Change: ComfortViewFactorAngles
Field 2 (A2) Zone Name (zone_name) is deleted.
Remaining fields shift up one place.

# Object Change: ElectricEquipment and Lights
Field 6 (N2) field name changed from "Watts per Zone Floor Area" (watts_per_zone_floor_area) to "Watts per Floor Area" (watts_per_floor_area).

## Object Changes: HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent

[PR#10277](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/10277/)

remove the following four fields
N4: Sensible Effectiveness at 75% Heating Air Flow
N5: Latent Effectiveness at 75% Heating Air Flow
N8: Sensible Effectiveness at 75% Cooling Air Flow
N9: Latent Effectiveness at 75% Cooling Air Flow

add four curve fields at the end occupying A11 to A14
A11: Sensible Effectiveness of Heating Air Flow Curve Name
A12: Latent Effectiveness of Heating Air Flow Curve Name
A13: Sensible Effectiveness of Cooling Air Flow Curve Name
A14: Latent Effectiveness of Cooling Air Flow Curve Name

when N4, N5, N8, N9 has value non-equal to the 100% value, curve objects will be created.

sudo code is as follows

    tableAdded = FALSE

    for each HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent object {

        Read in 8 reference effectiveness value
        e100_1: sensible heating 100%
        e100_2: latent heating 100%
        e75_1 : sensible heating 75%
        e75_2 : latent heating 75%
        e100_3: sensible cooling 100%
        e100_4: latent cooling 100%
        e75_3 : sensible cooling 75%
        e75_4 : latent cooling 75%

        Remove the 4 fields for 75% airflow and adjust the index of the fields

        For each pair (e75_i, e100_i) {

            If e75_i != e100_i {// needs a table/curve for the effectiveness

              tableAdded = TRUE

              Add the following chunk

                Table:Lookup,
                  <HX_name>_<curve_id>,   !- Name

                  e75_i,                    !- Output Value 1
                  e100_i;                    !- Output Value 2
            }
        }
    }

    if tableAdded {

        add the following chunk for the independent variable

            Table:IndependentVariableList,
              effectiveness_IndependentVariableList,  !- Name
              airFlowRatio;     !- Independent Variable 1 Name
