Input Change Documentation
==========================

Each version of EnergyPlus includes some changes to the input syntax.  This can be added fields, renamed objects, fields that change meaning, etc.  This folder contains simple files that describe the input changes.  For convenience to developers, the format remains an Excel document.  This is acceptable in this case because we never care about differences on this file between commits.  Only the current state.
