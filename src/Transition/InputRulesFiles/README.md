Input Change Documentation
==========================

Each version of EnergyPlus includes some changes to the input syntax.  This can be added fields, renamed objects, fields that change meaning, etc.  This folder contains simple files that describe the input changes.  The format is currently a markdown text document (.md) and was an Excel document until v8.6.0.
