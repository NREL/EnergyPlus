Input Changes version 22.1.0 to 22.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: FUELFACTORS

The second and third input parameters for the FuelFactors input syntax were eliminated because they were never used in the program.  Everything else that comes after it is simply shifted forward.
