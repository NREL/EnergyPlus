Input Changes version 9.6.0 to 22.1.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: PythonPlugin:SearchPaths

Summary: A new field was added to have EnergyPlus search for Python scripts in the `epin` environment variable value

Fields 1-3 remain the same.
Field 4 is a new field that is defaulted to yes, and transition will fill the field with a yes.
Following fields remain the same.

See [PR#8807](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/8985)

# For WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider

* No transition required. 
* Field name "NFRC Product Type for Assembly Calculations" was added to the end of the input object.

See pull request [#8740](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/8740) for more details.
