Input Changes
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: `Boiler:HotWater`

The only change is for field F7, which was N3.  Logic to apply:

Fields F1-F6 (A1-A4, N1-N2) remain the same.  
Delete F7, which is N3 field. This field was removed as redundant: N3 , \field Design Water Outlet Temperature.
Move up all later numeric fields by one (old N4-N10 become new N3-N9).


(Developer note: to avoid merge conflicts, please choose a random line in the file below (there are like 20 blank lines initially).
 This will reduce the effect of all the rules being written on the same line, causing conflicts.)
 
 # Object Change: 'WindowMaterial:ComplexShade'
 
 The only change is for field A2 (Layer Type). Logic to apply:
 If field contains value Venetian then change it to VenetianHorizontal.

# Object Change: `AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:OutdoorAirFlow`

Field 1 remains the same.  
After F1, insert new alpha input choice field (A2) 'Outdoor Air Mixer Name' with the object name of  'OutdoorAir:Mixer'.
Shift all later fields down by 1. The old input fields F2 - F4 become the new F3-F5. The new input field becomes F2.

Note: The old input file has a single OutdoorAir:Mixer object, so that the name of OutdoorAir:Mixer is unique.

# Object Change: `AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:ReliefAirFlow`

Field 1 remains the same.  
After F1, insert new alpha input choice field (A2) 'Outdoor Air Mixer Name' with the object name of  'OutdoorAir:Mixer'.
Shift all later fields down by 1. The old input fields F2 - F4 become the new F3-F5. The new input field becomes F2.
