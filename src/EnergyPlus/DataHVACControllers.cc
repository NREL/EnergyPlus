    // PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
    // This data-only module is a repository for all variables used by the HVAC controllers.

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // na

    // USE STATEMENTS:
    // None!--This module is USEd by all other modules; it should not USE anything.

    // Data
    // -only module should be available to other modules and routines.
    // Thus, all variables in this module must be PUBLIC.
