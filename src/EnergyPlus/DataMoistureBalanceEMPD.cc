    // PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
    // This module should contain the information that is needed to calculate
    // moisture level at interior surfaces

    // Using/Aliasing
    using namespace DataPrecisionGlobals;

    // Data
    // module should be available to other modules and routines.  Thus,
    // all variables in this module must be PUBLIC.

    // MODULE PARAMETER DEFINITIONS

    // Parameters for the definition and limitation of arrays:

    Real64 const Lam(2500000.0); // heat of adsorption for building materials

    // INTERFACE BLOCK SPECIFICATIONS
    // na

    // MODULE VARIABLE DECLARATIONS:
    // Variables that are used in both the Surface Heat Balance and the Moisture Balance
    Array1D<Real64> RVSurfaceOld; // Moisture level at interior surfaces at previous time step
    Array1D<Real64> RVSurface;    // Moisture level at interior surfaces at current interation
    // and current time step
