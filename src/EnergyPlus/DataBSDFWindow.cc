    // PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
    // define the data structures to be used in calculating solar
    //  transmittance and absorptance and associated arsenal
    //  of geometry and window state information necessary

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // Matrix representation of bidirectional transmittance of radiance

    // Allocation of complex fenestration data:  SurfaceWindow(:)%ComplexFen is a structure of type BSDFWindowDescript
