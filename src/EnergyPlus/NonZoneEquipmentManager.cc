        // Zone equipment objects are generally triggered to "get input" when they are called for simulation
        // by the ZoneEquipmentManager because they are referenced by a Zone Equipment List.  In the case of
        // the NonZoneEquipmentManager, it does not yet have a list of non-zone equipment, so it must make
        // one here before it knows what to call for simulation.
