    The EnergyPlusPlugin class is the base class for all Python Plugin classes.
    Derived classes should inherit from this class and override at least one of the `on_*` functions.

    This base class instantiates the EnergyPlus API and makes it available to derived classes through the `self.api`
    member variable.  Scripts can then access the functional API through `self.api.functional` and the data exchange
    API through `self.api.exchange`.

    This base class also creates a convenience variable: self.data which is a dictionary.  This is purely a convenience
    to allow derived classes to store data on the class without having to declare a variable in a custom constructor.
    Derived classes can ignore this and store data as they see fit.
