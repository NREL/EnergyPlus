class EnergyPlusAPI:
    """
    This class exposes the EnergyPlus C Library API to Python.  The API is split into three categories, and this class
    exposes each API category through member variables.  If an instance of this class is created as
    `api = EnergyPlusAPI()`, then the following members are available:

    - `api.functional`: The functional API provides access to static API calls, such as thermophysical property methods.
    - `api.runtime`: The runtime API allows a user to provide Python functions as callbacks, which are then
      called from within EnergyPlus at specific points in the simulation.
    - `api.exchange` The data_exchange API allows a user to exchange data (get sensor values, set actuator values)
      from within runtime callback methods, during a simulation.  When this class is instantiated for Python Plugin use,
      this also exposes the plugin global data members to allow sharing data between plugins.

    In a makefile-style build, the API library (dll) should be in Products; for example: `/path_to_build/Products`.
    For Visual Studio, the DLL is inside of a Debug or Release folder inside that Products directory.  At build time,
    the cmake/PythonSetupAPIinBuild.cmake script is executed (the energyplusapi target depends on it).  At build time, the
    Python API files are placed inside of the Products directory on Makefile builds, and copied into *both* the Release
    and Debug folders on Visual Studio builds.  The API scripts are put into a pyenergyplus directory, so in all cases,
    the dynamic library will simply be in the current script's parent directory. In an installation, the library will be
    in the installation root, and the Python API files will be in a pyenergyplus directory inside that install root as
    well, so the binary will again just be in this script's parent directory.

    For either case, utilizing the Python API wrappers is straightforward: if executing from directly from the
    build or install folder, scripts can be imported as `from pyenergyplus.foo import bar`.  If executing from a totally
    separate directory, the build or install directory can be inserted into the beginning of sys.path so that the
    pyenergyplus directory can be found.

    To reference this in an IDE to allow writing scripts using autocomplete, etc., most IDEs allow you to add third-
    party library directories.  The directory to add would be the build or install folder, as appropriate, so that
    the `from pyenergyplus` import statements can find a pyenergyplus package inside that third-party directory.

                                         other API calling structures, and 2) Avoid re-instantiating the functional API
