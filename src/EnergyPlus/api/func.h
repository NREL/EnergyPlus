///          will be introduced throughout development cycles.  The functionality of this API category is available
///          without making a call to run EnergyPlus, however an `EnergyPlusState` object is still required for the
///          API calls.  The state object can be instantiated with a call to `stateNew` and managed with methods in the
///          state API category.
/// \remark Make sure to call `initializeFunctionalAPI` prior to calling any functional API methods to ensure the internal
///         structures are in place in the code.
