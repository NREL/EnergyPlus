// (Conjunction Of Multizone Infiltration Specialists) developed by a multinational, multi-institutional
// effort under the auspices of the International Energy Agency's Buildings and Community Systems Agreement
// working group focusing on multizone air flow modeling (Annex 23) and now administered by the Swiss Federal
// Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research (EMPA), Division 175, Uberlandstrasse 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf,
