/// \brief This is typedef for an instance that stores the "state" of an EnergyPlus simulation.
/// \details The state of an EnergyPlus simulation is at the center of accessing EnergyPlus through API methods.
///          All, or nearly all, simulation methods require an active simulation state as an argument.  This is because
///          those functions may set up data in various nooks and crannies of the state object in order to do its
///          calculations.  As such, prior to calling any API methods, a state object should be instantiated by calling
///          the `stateNew` method.  This instance should then be passed through all API methods that require a state
///          object.  Callback methods that are registered will have a single argument - the current state of the
///          program.  This allows the client to complete the loop with the current simulation state without having to
///          keep a state as a global variable in client code.  If the client wants to clear the state and begin a new
///          simulation process, that is possible by passing the state to `stateReset`.  Alternatively, if the client is
///          finished with that `state` instance, the value can be freed with a call to `stateDelete`.
///
///          The state object is at the heart of accessing EnergyPlus via API, however, the client code should simply be a
///          courier of this object, and never attempt to manipulate the object.  State manipulation occurs inside EnergyPlus,
///          and attempting to modify it manually will likely not end well for the workflow.

///          state can be reset using the `stateReset` function, or deleted completely with the `stateDelete` function.

/// \details A simulation state is created by calling the `stateNew` function.  After a simulation is complete, if a
///          second is to be run using the same memory space, the simulation state must be cleared with this function,
///          or unexpected errors will occur.  Once the client is fully finished with the state, it can be deleted
///          entirely with `stateDelete`.
