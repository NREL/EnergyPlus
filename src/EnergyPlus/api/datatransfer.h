/// \brief This "data exchange" API category provides access to read and write real-time data within a running simulation.
/// \details While an EnergyPlus simulation is running, simulation state is constantly being calculated and updated.  EMS was implemented in
///          EnergyPlus to allow user scripts to read variable data and write actuator data in custom ways.  This builds on top of that implementation
///          by allowing the user to write C code that can read/write simulation data.  This file includes methods that are specific to
///          PythonPlugin workflows, including PythonPlugin "Trend" and "Global" variables.  These mechanisms are only available in Plugin workflows
///          and will cause a program error if they are accessed in an "EnergyPlus-as-a-library" workflow.  However, there are many functions in this
///          file that are available for all API usages, including getting access to variables and meters, writing actuator values, and accessing
///          simulation state such as the day of week, hour of day, etc.
