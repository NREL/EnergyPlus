class DataExchange:
    """
    This API class enables data transfer between EnergyPlus and a client.  Output variables and meters are treated as
    "sensor" data.  A client should get a handle (integer) using one of the worker methods then make calls to get data
    using that handle.  Some specific variables in EnergyPlus are controllable as actuators.  These work the same way,
    in that a client should get an integer handle to an actuator and then use the workers to set the value on the
    actuator.  There are also some static data members in EnergyPlus that are exposed as "internal" variables.  These
    variables hold static data such as zone floor area and volume, so they do not change during a simulation, but are
    constant once they are assigned.  Even with this difference, the variables are still handled the same way, by
    getting an integer handle and then accessing the data using that handle.

    This data transfer class is used in one of two workflows:

    - When an outside tool is already running EnergyPlus using the Runtime API, and data transfer is to be made during
      callback functions. In this case, the script should create a DataTransfer API class by calling the `data_transfer`
      method on the main API class, never trying to create this class directly.
    - When a Python script is used in the EnergyPlus Python Plugin System, and the user runs the EnergyPlus binary.  In
      this case, the plugin may need access to state data to make control decisions, and this class enables that.  The
      plugin base class automatically creates an instance of this class, so client plugins that inherit that class will
      have a `self.api.exchange` instance of this class available, and should *not* attempt to create another one.

    Client Python code may make use of the methods to get/set plugin global variables, but only in the Python Plugin
    cases.  For the outside tool API usage, plugin global variables are not available, and data should be shared in the
    outside calling code.
