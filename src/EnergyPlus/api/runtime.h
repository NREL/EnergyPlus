/// \file runtime.h
/// \brief This "runtime" API category provides access to link into a running simulation by providing callback functions.
/// \details While an EnergyPlus simulation is running, registered callback functions are "called back" at user-specified
///          points in the simulation.  When a function is called back, it can then leverage other APIs to do program
///          manipulation.  For example, it could leverage the functional API to look up a fluid property value, then
///          use the data exchange API to assign a new control property on a component using an actuator.
///          At the heart of the API functionality is the use of an `EnergyPlusState` object, which is required to be
///          passed into nearly every API function.  The client should get a new state instance by calling `newState`,
///          then use this new state to make API calls, including registering client functions as callbacks.
///          Once the callback functions have been registered, the client should then call the main `energyplus` function
///          to initiate a new run.  If multiple runs are to be performed in series, the `stateReset` function can be
///          used to "reset" the state.  There are also methods to allow issuing warnings through internal EnergyPlus
///          methods and to callback with updates on simulation progress and output messages.

/// \brief Runs an EnergyPlus simulation
/// \details This function launches an EnergyPlus simulation using the given arguments.  The first argument is an
///          EnergyPlus "state", which is used for storing a running simulation state.  The rest of the arguments are
///          identical to the command line for EnergyPlus(.exe).  Prior to calling this function, it is expected that
///          most workflows will register callback functions to be called back from EnergyPlus at user-specified points
///          in the simulation.  If no callbacks are registered, EnergyPlus will proceed as in a regular command line
///          fashion and return when complete.  An example usage of this API endpoint is as follows:
/// \param[in] state An active EnergyPlusState instance created with `stateNew`.
/// \param[in] argc Size of argument list
/// \param[in] argv Argument list to be passed to EnergyPlus
/// \code{.c}
///   void progressCallback(EnergyPlusState state, int const i) {
///     printf("Updated progress: %d", i);
///   }
///   int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
///     EnergyPlusState state = stateNew();
///     registerProgressCallback(state, progressCallback);
///     energyplus(state, argc, argv);
///     stateDelete(state);
///   }
/// \endcode
/// \remark If this function is called multiple times in the same thread, the client must call `stateReset` in
///         between each run, or unexpected errors will occur.
/// \remark Prior to calling this function, it is also expected that most workflows will want to use the data exchange API
///         function `requestVariable` to pre-request Output:Variables to make them accessible in the data exchange functions.
