Rongpeng ZHANG, Apr. 2017
(This is a reminder to the following developer. Please delete this file before the final delivery of the feature.)

1. Integrate the evaporative cooling model, instead of read in the evaporative heat transfer calculated separately.
2. Allow the model to utilize the precipitation/wind/solar information in the weather file.
3. Allow the model to utilize the customized schedules that the user provides.
