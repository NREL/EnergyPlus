        // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
        // This subroutine serves as the main drive for the
        // calculation of Conduction Transfer Functions (CTFs)
        // using the state space method.

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // The basic steps of this routine (which may be a little difficult
        // to decipher until another major revision is done) are:
        //   1. Determine if enough material info has been entered
        //   2. Determine whether construct is (a) all resistive,
        //      (b) the reverse of a previously calculated construct, or
        //      (c) neither (a) nor (b), i.e. a layer for which CTFs must
        //      be calculated.
        //   3. If the answer to 2 is (a), calculate the overall resistance
        //      and use this as the CTF (steady state conduction).
        //   4. If the answer to 2 is (b), transfer the CTFs for the reverse
        //      construction to the CTF arrays for this construct (reversing
        //      the inside and outside terms).
        //   5. If the answer to 2 is (c), calculate the CTFs using the state
        //      space method described below.
        // The state space method of calculating CTFs involves
        // applying a finite difference grid to a multilayered
        // building element and performing linear algebra on the
        // resulting system of equations (in matrix form).
        // CTFs must be calculated for non-reversed layers which
        // have an appreciable thermal mass.  A conversion from
        // SI units to English units is made due to concerns
        // about round off problems noted in earlier version of
        // this subroutine.

        // user had entered a "no insulation" layer with an R-value of 1.0E-05.

        // there is no guarantee that this is a good value.

        // for CTF calculations to be 4 hours.  This is done in response to some
        // rare situations where odd or faulty input will cause the routine to
        // go off and get some huge time step (in excess of 20 hours).  This value
        // is a compromise that does not really solve any input problems.  One run
        // indicated that 2 meters of concrete will result in a time step of slightly
        // more than 3 hours.  So, 4 hours was arbitrarily picked as a ceiling for
        // time steps so that an error message can be produced to warn the user
        // that something isn't right.  Note that the 4 hour limit does not guarantee
        // that problems won't exist and it does not necessarily avoid any problems

        // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
        // This subroutine computes the exponential matrix exp(AMat*delt) for
        // use in the state space method for the calculation of CTFs.

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // Uses the method of Taylor expansion combined with scaling and
        // squaring to most efficiently compute the exponential matrix.  The
        // steps in the procedure are outlined in Seem's dissertation in
        // Appendix A, page 128.  Exponential matrix multiplication modified
        // to take advantage of the characteristic form of AMat.  AMat starts
        // out as a tri-diagonal matrix.  Each time AMat is raised to a higher
        // power two extra non-zero diagonals are added.  ExponMatrix now
        // recognizes this.  This should speed up the calcs somewhat.  Also, a
        // new cut-off criteria based on the significant figures of double-
        // precision variables has been added.  The main loop for higher powers
        // of AMat is now stopped whenever these powers of AMat will no longer
        // add to the summation (AExp) instead ofstopping potentially at the
        // artifical limit of AMat**100.

        // precision variables plus a safety factor.- The argument for setting this parameter to 1E-20 involves the
        // number of significant figures for REAL(r64) variables which is 16 and the largest power to which
        // AMat will be raised which is 100.  This would be a factor of 1E-18.  A factor of "safety" of another 100

        // adding the second to the first will not effect the first.  However, on the conservative side, there could
        // be up to 100 numbers which might, added together, still could effect the original number.  Each
        // successive power of AMat will have terms smaller than the previous power.  Thus, when the ratio between
        // the terms of the latest power of AMat and the total (AExp) is less than DPLim, all further powers of
        // AMat will have absolutely no effect on the REAL(r64) value of AExp.  Thus, there is no need to
        // continue the calculation.  In effect, AExp has "converged".  In REAL(r64)ity, 1E-16 would probably guarantee
        // convergence since AMat terms drop off quickly, but the extra powers allows for differences between

        // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
        // Subprogram to calculate the Sj and ej coefficients of Seem's
        // dissertation.  Follows Seem's technique to compute the coefficients
        // in order with minimum storage requirements.

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // Combine the results of the ExponMatrix, InvertMatrix, and
        // CalculateGammas routines together to arrive at the temperature
        // coefficients (s, s0) and the heat flux history coefficients (e) of
        // the CTFs.  The outline of this subroutine is based on step 5 of
        // Seem's suggested implementation of the state space method found on
        // pages 26+27 of his dissertation.

        // The state space method of calculating CTFs is outlined in the
        // doctoral dissertation of John Seem, "Modeling of Heat Transfer in
