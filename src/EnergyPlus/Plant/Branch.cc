        //       AUTHOR         Edwin Lee
        //       DATE WRITTEN   September 2010
        //       MODIFIED       na

        // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
        // This routine will analyze the given branch and determine the representative
        //  flow request.

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // Several possibilities are available.  In any case, the request is constrained to within
        //  branch outlet min/max avail.  This assumes that the component flow routines will properly
        //  propagate the min/max avail down the branch.
        // Some possibilities for flow request are:
        //  1) take the outlet flow rate -- assumes that the last component wins
        //  2) take the inlet flow rate request -- assumes that the request is propagated up and is good
        //  3) take the maximum request
        //  4) move down the loop and take the maximum "non-load-range-based" request within min/max avail bounds
        //     This assumes that load range based should not request flow for load-rejection purposes, and we
        //     should only "respond" to other component types.

        int const BranchOutletNodeNum = this->NodeNumOut;

        if (this->ControlType != DataBranchAirLoopPlant::ControlTypeEnum::SeriesActive) {
            OverallFlowRequest = DataLoopNode::Node(BranchInletNodeNum).MassFlowRateRequest;
        } else { // is series active, so take largest request of all the component inlet nodes
            for (int CompCounter = 1; CompCounter <= this->TotalComponents; ++CompCounter) {
                int const CompInletNode = this->Comp(CompCounter).NodeNumIn;
                OverallFlowRequest = max(OverallFlowRequest, DataLoopNode::Node(CompInletNode).MassFlowRateRequest);
            }
        }

        //~ Now use a worker to bound the value to outlet min/max avail
        OverallFlowRequest = PlantUtilities::BoundValueToNodeMinMaxAvail(OverallFlowRequest, BranchOutletNodeNum);
