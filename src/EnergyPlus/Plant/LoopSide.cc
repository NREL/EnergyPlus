        // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
        // SimSupplyFlowSolution is the driver routine for plant loops.  It performs
        //  the following tasks for each half loop (supply or demand side):
        // 1. Calculate flow request for half loop
        // 2. Predict Loop Flow
        // 3. Simulate the inlet branch
        // 4. Simulate the parallel branches, distributing load if necessary
        // 5. Set flow rates on parallel branches
        // 6. Simulate outlet branch and update node and report variables

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // The algorithm operates on a predictor/corrector flow setting method by simulating all available loop components
        // based on component requested flow rates, then enforcing continuity on all loop branch flows by calling
        // the flow resolver and locking those flows down.  Available components are then re-simulated using the
        // corrected flow rates.

        // PURPOSE OF THIS FUNCTION:
        // This routine will scan all the loop side paths and validate the component topology according
        //  to current topology rules and regulations.

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // Scan this loop side and begin by scanning the first branch, then follow with the remainder of the flow paths
        //  - this would be from splitter outlet nodes all the way to the loop side outlet node.
        // The current rules are that "other types" of components (as defined below in the references) can be placed along each
        //  flow path as needed.  At this point, any number of "load-range based" components can be placed along the flow
        //  path.  After this, the user is allowed to place another set of any number of "other types" of components.
        // The key restriction is that an "other type" of component may not be sandwiched by "load-range based" components.
        // This is due to the load range based needing to be simulated all at once along each flow path.

        // REFERENCES:
        // "other types" of components: basically not load-range based heat transfer components.  This would include:
        //    - demand based components such as coils
        //    - component setpoint based operating components
        //    - heat exchanger components including waterside economizers
        // "load-range based" components are heat transfer components which are controlled based on a single load range.
        //    - currently only one load range based scheme is available at a given time, although other control types
        //      may be enabled, such as component setpoint.
        // Pumps are separate components since the pump heat is not accounted for in the flow path order.
        //  Improvements during the demand side rewrite has allowed pumps to be placed as -not- the first component on a branch
        //  Pumps can be placed anywhere, even between load-range based components, since they will not affect loop load

        // This routine takes the flow resolved flow rate and pushes it
        //  down a branch.  In the process, if an externally connected
        //  component (air-water coil for example) is found to have a
        //  differing flow rate, the air sim flag is tripped to true, but
        //  the flow resolved flow rate is pushed down the loop to allow
        //  the plant to finish successfully.

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // Push mass flow rate and max avail down each branch.  If the component
        //  is connected (or could be, for now) to an external loop such as
        //  an air loop, the current component outlet mass flow is checked
        //  vs the current resolved mass flow.  If the mass flow doesn't match,
        //  the air sim flag is tripped to true.

        // Currently this routine is only performed for starved branches, when
        //  the coil is requesting too much flow, more than the plant can provide.
        // If this were moved to every call type, including a minimum plant flow,
        //  you would need to provide a mass flow and min/max avail to push
        //  down the branch as well.

        //       RE-ENGINEERED  Sept 2010 Dan Fisher, Brent Griffith for demand side update

        // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
        // This subroutine takes the overall loop side flow and distributes
        // it among parallel branches. this is the main implementation of
        // flow splitting for plant splitter/mixer

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // Flow through the branches is currently determined by
        // the active component on the branch, as well as the
        // order of the branches following the splitter.
        // SimPlantEquipment is run first, and the active components
        // request their flow.  These flows are compared and a simple
        // algorithm balances flow in the branches.  The flow in these
        // branches is then locked down, via MassFlowRateMaxAvail and MinAvail
        // SimPlant Equipment is then run again in order to get correct
        // properties.  Finally, Max/MinAvail are reset for the next time step.

        // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
        // This routine will manage the component simulation on a single set of parallel branches
        // This routine also reverts to a single branch simulation if there isn't a set of parallel branches

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // Loop through all components, and simulate first the non-load range based on each branch.
        // When a load-range based (LRB) is encountered, the simulation moves to the next branch to do non-LRB components.
        // When all paths are exhausted the simulation begins simulating LRB components.  Before each comp, the load distribution
        //  engine is called to handle the load distribution for this current pass.  If load is successfully distributed, this is
        //  flagged, and not called again.  If load is not distributed (i.e. this component isn't ON right now), then the
        //  load distribution engine will be called again before the next component.
        // After all load distribution is done and those components are complete, the simulation moves back to do any
        //  remaining components that may be downstream.

        //  it will make the changes to the module level loop demand variables.

        // Components will always supply a useful delta T, even if it happens to be zero
        // For flow rate, make decisions based on the component's current operating scheme type:
        //    Demand based: these components will have a flow request on their inlet node
        //    Pump: these components will not be included, as they no longer include heat at the pump
        //    component setpoint: these components will have a flow request

        //    on their outlet node corresponding to their calculated delta T
        //    load range based: these components do not 'alter' the load, they reject the load
