        // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
        // This subroutine calls the appropriate routines to simulate
        // the equipment on the plant.

        // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
        // This subroutine employs a rule-based
        // scheme to operate the plant equipment simulation without
        // requiring a detailed flow network solver.  The scheme is based
        // on several restrictive assumptions which may be relaxed when
        // a more detailed solution technique is developed.  The current
        // assumptions are:
        //    1.   All loop cooling/heating equipment is connected
        //         in parallel.
        //    2.   Only one circulation pump may be specified per loop.
        //    3.   The circulation pump must be specified first in the
        //         simulation order and is assumed to be connected in
        //         series with the cooling/heating equipment.
        //    4.   The Circ. pump determines the maximum flow rate for
        //         the loop.
        // The scheme is valid only for Part Load based plant equipment
        // models (currently the only type implemented).  Each equipment
        // simulation updates its outlet node temperature, estimates its
        // flow rate and returns a remaining loop demand which is passed
        // on to the other available equipment.

        // NOTE: All Equipment return the index of their lists during "InitLoopEquip"
        // as a time reduction measure.  Specific ifs are set to catch those modules that don't.
        // If you add a module or new equipment type, you must set up this structure.
