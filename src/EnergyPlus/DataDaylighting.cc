    //       DATE WRITTEN   May 1998
    //       MODIFIED       B.Griffith added interior window data for associated exterior windows
    //       RE-ENGINEERED  April 2003

    // PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
    // This data-only module is a repository for variables used in daylighting which
    // are shared by several modules.

    // Detailed zone with which it shares an interior window
