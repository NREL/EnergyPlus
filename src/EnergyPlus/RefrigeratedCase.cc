// PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
// To simulate refrigerated cases,walk-in coolers, secondary loops,
//             compressor racks, and detailed refrigeration systems.
// Case performance is varied based on specific operating conditions within the zone.

// METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
// Refrigerated cases are simulated based on performance information available from manufacturers
// and knowing the latent heat ratio of the case cooling load which can be obtained from ASHRAE or
// others who have completed research to quantify this value. The sensible case credits
// (sensible cooling provided to the surrounding zone air) are calculated during input
// processing by subtracting the fan, lighting, and anti-sweat heater energy from the
// design sensible capacity (TotCap * (1-LHR) * RTF).  The actual latent cooling provided
// by the case (at the actual operating conditions) is calculated based on the latent performance
// curve supplied by the user.  The actual sensible cooling provided by the case (at the actual
// operating conditions) is calculated by summing all sensible components (fan + light + anti-sweat +
// sensible case credit). The case (evaporator) fans are assumed to be disabled during hot-gas or
// electric defrost modes. A stocking schedule (W/m) is available for added load if desired.
// Walk-In coolers are simulated based on the specified sum of the conductance*area of each wall and door facing
// up to three (extendible) zones.  Two types of doors are specified, stock doors and glass doors.  For each category
// of doors, schedules for door openings are used with ASHRAE models for infiltration
// which are a function of the height of the door.  That
// infiltration is used to calculate the latent load on the cooler and the latent case credits for each zone.
// The sensible case credit for each zone is the sum of the conductive and sensible infiltration load
// for each surface/door facing that zone.  Note that the latent portion of the infiltration is unused
// during defrost to be consistent with decision for refrigerated cases.
// Compressor racks are simulated by summing the attached refrigerated case and walk-in cooler
// capacities.  The energy use of the
// compressor rack is then calculated with a simplified model for COP variation with temperature. Condenser fan power
// is based on a user-supplied curve object. Racks are not scheduled.
// Compressor racks may have indoor (in-zone) or outdoor condensers.  If outdoors, the condensers may be cooled
// by dry air cooling or evaporative cooling. A water-cooled condenser is also available by specifying water-cooling
// as the Condenser Type.  If a water-cooled condenser is utilized, a second entry to this module will
// occur during the HVAC simulation as called from the NonZoneEquipmentManager.
// Detailed refrigeration systems model each compressor individually using the manufacturer's rating curves.
// A collection of such curves has been added in the datasets library. The curves produce the refrigeration
// capacity and power consumption. The capacity needed is based on the sum of the case and walk-in loads (as is done
// for the compressor racks).  The compressors are dispatched to meet this load according to the order
// prescribed in the compressor list input object. The condenser for each system can be air-cooled,
// evaporative-cooled, or water cooled.  For air and evap-cooled condensers, manufacturer's rating data
// is input to describe the performance and to determine the required air flow rate, which is used to
// calculate the fan power requirements.  The fans can be described as single-speed, two-speed, or variable
// speed. The condenser performance data also is used to calculate the condensing temperature, which is a function
// of the heat sink temperature and the load on the condenser.  This must be solved iteratively, checking on
// the calculated refrigerant mass flow through the compressors.  The solution usually requires less than 5 iterations.
// The refrigerant state exiting the compressor group is known so the amount of heat available for
// desuperheat reclaim is explicitly known.
// The detailed refrigeration model allows the use of subcoolers,secondary loops, and cascade condensers
// to transfer load from one suction group to another. This introduces the need for further iterations among
// the systems.  Three loops through the
// systems are adequate to model these interactions.  The detailed model will also calculate a variable suction
// pressure for systems with controls that allow the suction temperature/pressure to float
// up when the case loads are less than their design capacity.

// Secondary Systems include case and walk-in refrigeration loads.  However, the balance of the system is
// made up of a heat exchanger and circulating pump(s) instead of a condenser and compressors.
// The total load on the heat exchanger is the sum of the refrigeration loads, any pipe heat gains,
// and the portion of the pump power that is absorbed by the circulating fluid. If the total load is
// greater than the rated capacity of the secondary loop, the unmet load for any time step is carried over
// to the next time step.  Each secondary system appears as a load on a detailed refrigeration system. If
// any of the cases or walk-ins served by a secondary are defrosted using hot brine, the primary system
// serving the secondary loop receives the defrost energy credits (i.e., heat reclaim used to generate defrost
// energy).

// Cascade Condensers allow the use of a higher temperature refrigeration system (primary system) to serve as a
// heat rejection sink for a lower temperature refrigeration system (secondary system). The condensing
// temperature can be fixed or can be allowed to float according to the minimum required evaporating temperature
// for other loads upon the primary system. For cases and walk-ins served by cascade condensers, energy associated
// with hot gas defrost is reclaimed from the primary system.  The refrigeration load the cascade condenser
// places upon the primary system is the sum of all case and walk-in loads served by the secondary system plus
// the sum of the secondary loop's compressor power. The same name used to identify the condenser in the
// secondary loop is used to identify the cascade load on the primary system.

// Detailed transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems model each compressor individually using the manufacturer's
// performance data. A collection of CO2 compressor performance curves has been added in the datasets library.
// The curves produce the refrigeration capacity and power consumption. The capacity required is based on the sum
// of the case and walk-in loads and the compressors are dispatched to meet this load according to the order
// prescribed in the compressor list input object. Currently, an air-cooled gas cooler is modeled, and
// manufacturer's rating data is input to describe the performance and to determine the required fan power
// requirements. The gas cooler fans can be described as single-speed, two-speed, or variable speed. During
// transcritical operation, the optimal gas cooler pressure, which maximizes the system's COP, is determined as
// a function of the ambient air temperature. During subcritical operation, the condensing pressure is allowed to
// float with ambient temperature in order to achieve maximum performance.

// This module was designed to be accessed once for each time step.  It uses several accumulating variables
//  to carry unmet loads from one time step to the next (cases/walk-ins and compressors.  Also, it meets
//  heat reclaim needs with the loads from the previous time step (because they are unknown for the current
//  zone time step).  However, the loads time step may be repeated, such as when a demand manager is used.
//  For that purpose, the values for these accumulating variables are saved at the start of each time step
//  and reset whenever the time step is repeated.  (see the init subroutine.)
// This correction is also applied when working on the system time step for coil-type loads by setting the saved values
//  at the start of each system time step to the value at the end of the previous time step. They are reset
//  to that value at each sys time step iteration. (see InitRefrigeration)

    // SUBROUTINE INFORMATION:
    //       AUTHOR         Richard Raustad, FSEC
    //       DATE WRITTEN   Oct/Nov 2004
    //       MODIFIED       Hudson, ORNL July 2007, Stovall, ORNL, 2008
    //       RE-ENGINEERED  na

    // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
    // Initialize (zero) global variables before simulating compressor racks and refrigerated cases
    // Several variables in this module are accumulative.  For example, unmet compressor loads are carried over
    // to the next time step. Ice loads are accumulated until melted by a defrost.  Because this module can be
    // called multiple times during any single time step, these summations need to be saved ONLY on the last time
    // through any given time step.

    // It is necessary to decrease the condenser load by the amount of heat used elsewhere
    //   via desuperheating water heaters and heating coils.
    //   Because the refrigeration system is solved before the HVAC time step loops, the
    //   refrigeration system must use the values lagged from the previous time step. In
    //   terms of energy, this should balance out and is preferable to not making the correction,
    //   in which case the condenser cooling water/air/fan energy are charged with energy
    //   loads that have been accounted elsewhere.  For consistency, the lagged value must be used,
    //   even if the Zone time step is repeated.  Therefore, the lagged variables are saved
    //   here for use during successive iterations of same zone/load time step.

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // Global variables for Case Credit are located in DataHeatBalance. To Zone variables are used in the Air Heat
    // Balance in ZoneTempPredictorCorrector to calculate the zone load. To HVAC variables are used in
    // ZoneEquipmentManager to add the portion of case credits attributed to the HVAC system to the zone return air node.

    // Because we can't know apriori whether or not the time step will be repeated, we save the most recent
    // addition/subtraction to/from each accumulating variable.  If the time step is repeated,
    // this most recent addition/subtraction is reversed before the rest of the refrigeration simulation begins.

    // Used to adjust accumulative variables when time step is repeated

    //       DATE WRITTEN   Oct/Nov 2004

    //       RE-ENGINEERED  na

    // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
    // To model refrigerated cases.

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // Case performance is based on a latent component calculated using a user input curve object. The sensible
    // component is made up of all equipment loads (fan, light, anti-sweat) and the sensible case credit
    // calculated during initialization. A master schedule is used for the refrigerated case operation and
    // additional schedules control the lights and defrost operation.
    // The fan is assumed to be off for Hot-Gas and Electric defrost.

    // Unmet loads are accumulated to be met the following time step.  This usually occurs only during the
    // defrost period, so the case calls for full capacity at the end of defrost to make up for the sensible
    // case gains during the defrost period. This feature is also used if needed for restocking loads.

    // Iterations are used here to account for load transfer between independent refrigeration systems
    // via mechanical subcoolers.
    // The logical variable, UseSysTimeStep, determines whether we are evaluating only systems driven by
    // ZoneEquipmentManager on the system time step, or only system driven by HVACManager on the zone time step.

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // Each refrigeration system is modeled by first simulating the attached refrigerated cases and
    // walk-ins. The sum of the total heat transfer for all attached cases and walk-ins determines
    // the load on the compressors. Iterations are used here to account for sharing of gas coolers
    // between independent refrigeration systems.

    //       MODIFIED       na

    // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
    // Find the gas cooler outlet temperature, the optimum gas cooler pressure, heat rejection,
    // fan power, and fan energy for a detailed transcritical CO2 refrigeration system.

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // For a specified gas cooler outlet temperature in transcritical operation, there is an optimal gas cooler
    // pressure which produces the highest COP. A curve-fit equation similar to that presented by Ge and Tassou
    // (2011) and Sawalha (2008) is used to determine the optimum gas cooler pressure for a given gas cooler
    // outlet temperature. In subcritical operation, the condensing temperature and pressure are allowed to
    // float with ambient conditions, above the minimum condensing temperature.

    //       DATE WRITTEN   Oct/Nov 2004
    //       MODIFIED       na
    //       RE-ENGINEERED  na

    // PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE:
    // To model Walk In Coolers.

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // Walk-in cooler performance is based on the ASHRAE load model, which includes
    // infiltration through door openings and sensible loss through walls/ceilings identified
    // by the user as sum of UA for each zone. A sub-floor heater is assumed to be sized so that
    // the temperature of the slab beneath the floor insulation is the same as the ground
    // temperature (to avoid ground freezing and heaving).
    // All equipment loads (fan, light, heaters) are modeled as well.  Sensible and latent
    // exchange with multiple adjoining zones is included. A master schedule is used for the Walk In operation and
    // additional schedules control the lights, defrost, and heater operation.

    // The fan is assumed to be off for Hot-Gas, Hot-Brine, and Electric defrost. The user can choose
    // to include the load due to bringing the coil mass up from the evaporating temperature to the melting temperature
    //  if they choose.  Otherwise this factor is set to zero.

    // Unmet loads are accumulated to be met the following time step.  This usually occurs during defrost and
    // restocking.

    // For cases and walk-ins, a portion of the model is directed toward

    // volume at the desired temperature due to heat exchange with the surrounding
    // zone, and that zone is conditioned to a nearly constant temperature.
    // In a refrigerated warehouse, the refrigeration load is caused by heat exchange
    // with a variable external environment.  For that reason, the loads for these

    // setpoints is then passed to the air chiller model, in a similar fashion
    // to the load passed to a window air conditioner model. The air chillers
    // are therefore solved using the system time step, not the zone time step
    // used for cases and walk-ins.
    // The air chiller performance is based on three types of manufacturers ratings,
    // Unit Load Factor, Total Capacity Map, or a set of European standards.
