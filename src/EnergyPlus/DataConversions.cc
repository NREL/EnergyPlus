    // PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
    // This data-only module is a repository for conversion unit variables which
    // strictly "should not be needed" in EnergyPlus but may be used in a few
    // places (e.g. Conduction Transfer Functions).  We have adopted the "international
    // table" for conversions.

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // na

    // REFERENCES:
    // Original Reference: DARCOM P 706-470, Engineering Design Handbook,
    // Metric Conversion Guide, July 1976.
    // Federal Standard 376B, January 27, 1993.  Preferred metric units
    // for general use by the Federal Government.
    // ASHRAE has similar recommendations.
