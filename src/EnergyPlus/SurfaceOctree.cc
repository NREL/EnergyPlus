// Package: Surface Octree System
//
// Purpose: Spatial sort of surfaces for fast, scalable identification of active surfaces for algorithms
//  making spatial queries such as solar shading, solar reflection, and daylighting obstruction
//
// Author: Stuart Mentzer (Stuart_Mentzer@objexx.com)
//
// History:
//  Sep 2015: Experimental code
//  Jan 2016: Initial release
//
// Notes:
//  Initial octree is for use in daylighting but should be adaptable to other use cases:
//   Surfaces without vertices are omitted
//   Transparent surfaces are omitted (can't obstruct light)
//  The octree holds live references to surfaces so it must be updated if surfaces change after its construction (this doesn't occur in EnergyPlus
//  currently) Copy and move ctors/assignment omitted for now since not needed The use of multiple octrees for faster lookups of surface type subsets
//  may be worthwhile for performance in some uses Octree variations and parameter tuning can give better performance for specific applications This
//  design uses "tight" cubes (no overlap) and surfaces filtering down to deepest cube they fit in completely Alternative designs that might offer
//  somewhat better or worse performance:
//   Loose cubes oversied by x2 or some other factor to allow surfaces to filter down further: This requires more cubes to be processed for a given
//   operation Filter all surfaces down to leaf cubes placing a surface in any cube it intersects: More specificity but redundant surfaces in each
//   operation so must collect them in a set
