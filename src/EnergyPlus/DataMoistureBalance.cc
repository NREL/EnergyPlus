	// MODULE INFORMATION:
	//       AUTHOR         Richard J. Liesen
	//       DATE WRITTEN   May 2000
	//       MODIFIED       April 2008; CondFD still uses some of this data.
	//       RE-ENGINEERED  na

	// PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
	// This module should contain the information that is needed to between the
	// MTF moisture modules and the calculation of the transfer functions
	// Data is still used in the CondFD solution.

	// Using/Aliasing
	using namespace DataPrecisionGlobals;

	// Data
	// module should be available to other modules and routines.  Thus,
	// all variables in this module must be PUBLIC.

	// MODULE PARAMETER DEFINITIONS

	// Parameters for the definition and limitation of arrays:

	// This is more or less the traditional value from BLAST.
	Real64 const Lam( 2500000.0 ); // heat of adsorption for building materials

	// INTERFACE BLOCK SPECIFICATIONS
	// na

	// MODULE VARIABLE DECLARATIONS:
	// Public Variables that will also be used in the Moisture Surface Balance
