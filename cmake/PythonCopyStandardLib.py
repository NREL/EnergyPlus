# Copies the Python standard library to the target dir
# If the target_dir already exists, it doesn't do anything
# an easy way is to find the __init__ file for a known standard lib package and go two parents up
# should result in something like `/usr/lib/python3.7`

# this script must be called with two args:
# 1 - the path to the EnergyPlus executable in the install tree, which is be used to determine where to copy the library
#     since this is in the install tree, you'll need to use a cmake generator expression
# 2 - name of the folder to create to store the copied in python standard library, usually python_standard_library
