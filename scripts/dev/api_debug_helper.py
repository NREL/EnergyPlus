# This is just a small script that allows for easily running EnergyPlus for API calling debugging purposes
# It is currently set up for a Unix-ish environment, but could be adapted for all platforms
# To start debugging, follow these simple steps
# - You probably want to run from within a Python venv, so that you can quickly install custom dependencies.
#   To do that, just run `python -m venv /path/to/venv`
#   Then activate it with `. /path/to/venv/bin/activate`
#   Then pip install whatever you want with `pip install something` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# - Next prepare this file, setting the build directory, products directory, and IDF to test
# - Next prepare the build folder, make sure cmake is set up and run and it builds OK already
# - Now run the debugger by simply passing the Python binary to it: `gdb /path/to/venv/bin/python`
# - Inside the debugger, you set the command line args to run this file with `set args /path/to/this/file.py`
# - You can try to immediately run and see what happens by entering `r`, it should run EnergyPlus straight through
# - You can add breakpoints at any time, like `break SimulationManager.cc:188`, though it may ask you to confirm
# - You can change the E+ code in this repo, kill the current Python run with `k`, and then re-run this script with `r`
#   Because this script starts with a make command, it will then build the updated code before trying to call the API
#   This allows for rapid debugging iteration
