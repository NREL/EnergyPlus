"""
In a lot of modules, a boolean flag such as `ErrorsFound` is passed by
reference constantly to several functions, and a Fatal will be issued at the
end if this boolean turns out to be `true`. Each single function that takes
this boolean should be responsible to turn it to 'true' as needed, but
shouldn't be forcing it to false, because it risks erasing previous errors.

Eg:
    bool ErrorsFound = false;
    functionA(&ErrorsFound);
    functionB(&ErrorsFound);

if functionB forces ErrorsFound to 'false' at the beginning and does pass, it
would override the output of functionA which may have found errors!
