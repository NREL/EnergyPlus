# Contributing to EnergyPlus

First off, thanks for offering to contribute to EnergyPlus.  EnergyPlus is a software program supported by the United States Department of Energy, licensed and copyright through The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois and The Regents of the University of California, through Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  The license for EnergyPlus is a permissive BSD-style license.

Over time, EnergyPlus has become a more open project, with the first step being an open source license developed as a part of version 7.0, followed by a translation to C++ and a shift to the open Github development environment in 2014.  These steps have been made to encourage more public visibility of the project, and ultimately more engagement through user issue submission and user submitted contributions.

We are currently refining the contribution policy to protect all interested parties.  Once finished up, a contribution policy will be in place that will allow users to quickly submit their approval for the changes to be submitted to EnergyPlus.  Please check back shortly for an updated contribution policy.
