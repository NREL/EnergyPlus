# Contributing to EnergyPlus

First off, thanks for offering to contribute to EnergyPlus.  EnergyPlus is a software program supported by the United States Department of Energy, under the copyright of The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois and The Regents of the University of California, and licensed through Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  The license for EnergyPlus is a permissive BSD-style license.

Over time, EnergyPlus has become a more open project, with the first step being an open source license developed as a part of version 7.0, followed by a translation to C++ and a shift to the open Github development environment in 2014.  These steps have been made to encourage more public visibility of the project, and ultimately more engagement through user issue submission and user submitted contributions.

The current contribution policy is now available on the EnergyPlus [contribution policy page](https://www.energyplus.net/contributing). In addition to describing the contribution process, the contribution policy page also provides points of contact should assistance be required. Keep in mind that no external pull requests can be merged until the required steps are completed.
