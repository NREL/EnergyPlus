Time Dependent Valuation (TDV) energy values for all 16 California climate zones.

Data is formatted in terms of TDV nominal energy units for residential and nonresidential buildings.  TDV nominal energy units are the load weighted average statewide value of a kBtu of natural gas.  These are given for residential (present value over 30 years with a 3% real discount rate) and nonresidential (present value over 15 years with a 3% real discount rate) and are calculated with externalities.

The residential TDV's were calculated based upon a 30 year forecast and the nonresidential TDV's were calculated based upon a 15 year forecast.  For the 2008 standards the cost-effectiveness of the nonresidential envelope measures will be evaluated using a 30 life cycle cost analysis.  For nonresidential envelope calculations use the Non-Res (30 year) conversion with the nonresidential TDV's.

Overall Statewide Average PV $/kBtu $2001
With environmental externalities
Res(30 year)	    $0.164171/kBtu
Non-Res (15 year)	$0.084363/kBtu
Non-Res (30 year)	$0.145972/kBtu
