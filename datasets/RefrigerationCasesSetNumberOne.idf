!
! This dataset includes object types for Refrigeration:Case .
!
! Comments before each refrigeration:case object include the manufacturer's model number
!    and assumptions about the fan, lights, defrost etc.
!
! The user must ensure that the case names used in the idf file are UNIQUE
!   and must supply the correct zone name.
!
! The user must also supply any requrired correction curves or schedules.
! The defrost and drip-down schedule names included here indicate the frequency
!   and duration required. The user must ensure that schedules are provided
!   that meet these needs and that are diversified so that many cases don't
!   start their defrost cycles at the same time.
!
! Please see the example cases for supermarkets to see how these case objects are included
!   with the rest of a supermarket refrigeration system.
!
! An expansion of this database to include other manufacturers' refrigerated cases is in 
!   preparation and will be included in the fall 2010 EnergyPlus release.
!   If you need these input data before that time, please email stovalltk@ornl.gov
! If you find errors in this database, please notify stovalltk@ornl.gov
!
! Credit goes to Ian Doebber at National Renewable Energy Laboratory for developing
!   the software tool that helps prepare these input files from a summary excel data sheet.
!
! All the refrigerated cases included in this database are listed here and are followed
!    by an example Refrigeration:CaseAndWalkInList object.
