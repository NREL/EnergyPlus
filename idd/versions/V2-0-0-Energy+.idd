! Object Description
! ------------------
! To define an object (a record with data), develop a key word that is unique
! Each data item to the object can be A (Alphanumeric string) or N (numeric)
! Number each A and N.  This will show how the data items will be put into the
! arrays that are passed to the Input Processor "Get" (GetObjectItem) routines.
! All alpha fields are limited to 100 characters.  Numeric fields should be
! valid numerics (can include such as 1.0E+05) and are placed into single
! precision variables.
!
! NOTE: Even though a field may be optional, a comma representing that field
!   must be included (unless it is the last field in the object).  Since the
!   entire input is "field-oriented" and not "keyword-oriented", the EnergyPlus
!   Input Processor must have some representation (even if blank) for each
!   field.
!
! Object Documentation
! --------------------
! In addition, the following special comments appear one per line and
! most are followed by a value.  Comments may apply to a field or the object
! or a group of objects.
!
! Field-level comments:
!
!  \field           Name of field
!                     (should be succinct and readable, blanks are encouraged)
!
!  \note            Note describing the field and its valid values
!
!  \required-field  To flag fields which may not be left blank
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \units           Units (must be from EnergyPlus standard units list)
!                   EnergyPlus units are standard SI units
!
!  \ip-units        IP-Units (for use by input processors with IP units)
!                   This is only used if the default conversion is not
!                   appropriate.
!
!  \minimum         Minimum that includes the following value
!
!  \minimum>        Minimum that must be > than the following value
!
!  \maximum         Maximum that includes the following value
!
!  \maximum<        Maximum that must be < than the following value
!
!  \default         Default for the field (if N/A then omit entire line)
!
!  \autosizable     Flag to indicate that this field can be used with the Auto
!                   Sizing routines to produce calculated results for the
!                   field.  If a value follows this, then that will be used
!                   when the "Autosize" feature is flagged.  To trigger
!                   autosizing for a field, enter Autosize as the field's
!                   value.  Only applicable to numeric fields.
!
! \autocalculatable Flag to indicate that this field can be automatically
!                   calculated. To trigger auto calculation for a field, enter
!                   Autocalculate as the field's value.  Only applicable to
!                   numeric fields.
!
!  \type            Type of data for the field -
!                     integer
!                     real
!                     alpha       (arbitrary string),
!                     choice      (alpha with specific list of choices, see
!                                 \key)
!                     object-list (link to a list of objects defined elsewhere,
!                                  see \object-list and \reference)
!
!  \retaincase      Retains the alphabetic case for alpha type fields
!
!  \key             Possible value for "\type choice" (blanks are significant)
!                     use multiple \key lines to indicate all valid choices
!
!  \object-list     Name of a list of object names that are valid entries
!                     for this field (used with "\reference")
!                     see ZONE and Surface:HeatTransfer objects below for
!                     examples.
!            ** Note that a field may have only one \object-list reference.
!            ** If it must reference more than one object-list, then a
!               composite object-list should be created which contains all
!               valid references.
!
!  \reference       Name of a list of object names to which this object belongs
!                     used with "\type object-list" and with "\object-list"
!                     see ZONE and Surface:HeatTransfer objects below for
!                     examples:
!
!                        ZONE,
!                          A1 , \field Zone Name
!                               \type alpha
!                               \reference ZoneNames
!                        Surface:HeatTransfer,
!                          A4 , \field InsideFaceEnvironment
!                               \note Zone the surface is a part of
!                               \type object-list
!                               \object-list ZoneNames
!
!             For each zone, the field "Zone Name" may be referenced
!             by other objects, such as Surface:HeatTransfer, so it is
!             commented with "\reference ZoneNames"
!             Fields that reference a zone name, such as Surface:HeatTransfer's
!             "ZoneName", are commented as
!             "\type object-list" and "\object-list ZoneNames"
!             ** Note that a field may have multiple \reference commands.
!             ** This is useful if the object belongs to a small specific
!             object-list as well as a larger more general object-list.
!
! Object-level comments:
!
!  \memo            Memo describing the object
!
!  \unique-object   To flag objects which should appear only once in an idf
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \required-object To flag objects which are required in every idf
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \min-fields      Minimum number of fields that should be included in the
!                   object.  If appropriate, the Input Processor will fill
!                   any missing fields with defaults (for numeric fields).
!                   It will also supply that number of fields to the "get"
!                   routines using blanks for alpha fields (note -- blanks
!                   may not be allowable for some alpha fields).
!
!  \obsolete        This object has been replaced though is kept (and is read)
!                   in the current version.  Please refer to documentation as
!                   to the dispersal of the object.  If this object is
!                   encountered in an IDF, the InputProcessor will post an
!                   appropriate message to the error file.
!                   usage:  \obsolete New=>[New object name]
!
!  \extensible      This object is dynamically extensible -- meaning, if you
!           change the IDD appropriately (if the object has a simple list
!           structure -- just add items to the list arguments (i.e. BRANCH
!           LIST). These will be automatically redimensioned and used during
!           the simulation.
!
!  \format          The object should have a special format when saved in
!                   the IDF Editor with the special format option enabled.
!                   The options include SingleLine, Vertices, and
!                   CompactSchedule.
!                   The SingleLine option puts all the fields for the object
!                   on a single line. The Vertices option is used in objects
!                   that use X, Y and Z fields to format those three fields
!                   on a single line.
!                   The CompactSchedule formats that specific object.
!
! Group-level comments:
!
!  \group          Name for a group of related objects
!
!
! Notes on comments
! -----------------
!
! 1.  If a particular comment is not applicable (such as units, or default)
! then simply omit the comment rather than indicating N/A.
!
! 2.  Memos and notes should be brief (recommend 5 lines or less per block).
! More extensive explanations are expected to be in the user documentation
!

GroundTemperatures,

       \memo of "Ground".  Documentation about what values these should be is located in the

       \memo CAUTION - Do not use the "undisturbed" ground temperatures from the weather data.
       \memo These values are too extreme for the soil under a conditioned building.
       \memo For best results, use the Slab or Basement program to calculate custom monthly
       \memo average ground temperatures (see Auxiliary Programs).  For typical commercial
       \memo buildings in the USA, a reasonable default value is 2C less than the average indoor space temperature.

!*****************Controller****************************
! A Controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller, though it
! is somewhat more limited.  It can sense one node variable, compare it with
! its set point, and determine the desired value for another node variable.
!
! Rule: A Controller can not span a loop manager boundary (but a Set Point
! Manager can). Thus in an air loop the sensed node and the controlled
! device must be in the air loop.  This means that a single zone system can
! not be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and
! controlling coil water flow.  Instead this must be modeled as a Set Point
! Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature
! set point each time step.  This is artificial but should simplify the control
! modelling task.

   A6;  \field Cost Per Unit Value (or Variable)
        \note This field contains either a single number or the name of a variable.  The number is multiplied with
        \note all of the energy or demand or other source that is specified in the source field.  If a variable is
        \note used then the monthly values of the variable are multiplied against the variable specified in the

        \note The sizes of the blocks are usually used directly but if a value or a variable is entered here the block
        \note sizes entered in the rest of the charge are first multiplied by the entered value prior to being used.
        \note This is common for rates that are kWh/kW rates and in that case the variable that holds the monthly
        \note total electric demand would be entered.  If no value is entered a default value of one is assumed so

   A2,  \field Tariff Name
   A3,  \field Baseline Source Variable
        \note When the ratcheted value exceeds the baseline value for a month the ratcheted value is used but when the
        \note baseline value is greater then the ratcheted value the baseline value is used. Usually the electric
        \note demand charge is used.  The baseline source variable can be the results of another ratchet object. This
        \note allows utility tariffs that have multiple ratchets to be modeled.
   A4,  \field Adjustment Source Variable
        \note The variable that the ratchet is calculated from. It is often but not always the same as the baseline
        \note source variable.  The ratcheting calculations using offset and multiplier are using the values from the
        \note adjustment source variable. If left blank the adjustment source variable is the same as the baseline
        \note source variable.

        \note The name of the season that is being examined.  The maximum value for all of the months in the named
        \note season is what is used with the multiplier and offset.  This is most commonly Summer or Annual.  When
        \note Monthly is used the adjustment source variable is used directly for all months.
   A6,  \field Season To
        \type choice
        \key Annual
        \key Summer
        \key Winter
        \key Spring
        \key Fall
        \note The name of the season when the ratchet would be calculated.  This is most commonly Winter.  The ratchet
        \note only is applied to the months in the named season. The resulting variable for months not in the Season To
        \note selection will contain the values as appear in the baseline source variable.
   A7,  \field Multiplier Value (or Variable)
        \note Often the ratchet has a clause such as "the current month demand or 90% of the summer month demand".  For
        \note this case a value of 0.9 would be entered here as the multiplier.  This value may be left blank if no
        \note multiplier is needed and a value of one will be used as a default.
   A8;  \field Offset Value (or Variable)
        \note A less common strategy is to say that the ratchet must be all demand greater than a value in this case
        \note an offset that is added to the demand may be entered here. If entered it is common for the offset value
        \note to be negative representing that the demand be reduced.   If no value is entered it is assumed to be
        \note zero and not affect the ratchet.

       \note The method of aggregation for the selected variable or meter.
       \note SumOrAverage adds up the values for every timestep in the month if the variable is a sum variable. If the
       \note   variable is an average variable it reports the average value. This is probably the most common
       \note   aggregation type option to choose.
       \note Maximum and minimum find the maximum and minimum value for the month and report it along with the
       \note   time that it first occurred.  When maximum or minimum are selected a column is automatically shown
       \note   in the output report for the time that it occurred.  When maximum or minimum are used with an average
       \note   variable the value is divided by the length of the timestep.
       \note ValueWhenMaxMin looks at the previous variable in the report that sets a maximum or minimum and
       \note   displays the value of the current variable at that same timestep.  Order of the variables in the
       \note   report is important when using ValueWhenMaxMin.  This can be used when an outdoor temperature
       \note   should be reported for the time of the maximum cooling load.
       \note HoursNonZero adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable is non-zero and would
       \note   be appropriate to determine the number of hour that a fan operates.
       \note HoursZero - The HoursZero option adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable has a zero
       \note   value and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour that a fan does not operate.
       \note HoursPositive - The HoursPositive option adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable
       \note   has a positive value.  Hours with a zero value are not included.
       \note HoursNonPositive - The HoursNonPositive option adds up the elaspsed time during the month that this
       \note   variable has non-positive value. Hours with a negative value and hours with a zero value are all included.
       \note HoursNegative - The HoursNegative option adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable
       \note   has a negative value.  Hours with a zero value are not included.
       \note HoursNonNegative - The HoursNonNegative option adds up the elaspsed time during the month that this
       \note   variable has non-negative value. Hours with a positive value and hours with a zero value are all included.
       \note SumOrAverageDuringHoursShown - Provides the sum or average of the named variable when during the hours
       \note   that the previous variable displayed with any of the aggregation types starting with "Hours". For "sum"
       \note   type variables adds up the values for each timestep and reports the sum of the value monthly during the
       \note   hours reported on the previous variable.  For "average" type variables, the value shown will be the
       \note   average for the month during the hours reported on the previous variable.  Order of the variables in the
       \note   report is important when using this aggregation type.
       \note MaximumDuringHoursShown - Reports the maximum value and the time that the maximum value occurred but only
       \note   during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" aggregation type.  When the maximum option is used
       \note   with an average variable the value is divided by the length of the timestep.  Order of the variables in
       \note   the report is important when using this aggregation type.
       \note MinimumDuringHoursShown - Reports the minimum value and the time that the minimum value occurred but only
       \note   during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" aggregation type.  When the minimum option is used
       \note   with an average variable the value is divided by the length of the timestep.  Order of the variables in
       \note   the report is important when using this aggregation type.
