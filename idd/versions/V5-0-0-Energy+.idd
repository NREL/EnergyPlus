!IDD_Version 5.0.0.035
! **************************************************************************
! This file is the Input Data Dictionary (IDD) for EnergyPlus.
! The IDD defines the syntax and data model for each type of input "Object."
! Lines in EnergyPlus input files (and IDD) are limited to 500 characters.
!
! Object Description
! ------------------
! To define an object (a record with data), develop a key word that is unique
! Each data item to the object can be A (Alphanumeric string) or N (numeric)
! Number each A and N.  This will show how the data items will be put into the
! arrays that are passed to the Input Processor "Get" (GetObjectItem) routines.
! All alpha fields are limited to 100 characters.  Numeric fields should be
! valid numerics (can include such as 1.0E+05) and are placed into double
! precision variables.
!
! NOTE: Even though a field may be optional, a comma representing that field
!   must be included (unless it is the last field in the object).  Since the
!   entire input is "field-oriented" and not "keyword-oriented", the EnergyPlus
!   Input Processor must have some representation (even if blank) for each
!   field.
!
! Object Documentation
! --------------------
! In addition, the following special comments appear one per line and
! most are followed by a value.  Comments may apply to a field or the object
! or a group of objects.
!
! Field-level comments:
!
!  \field           Name of field
!                     (should be succinct and readable, blanks are encouraged)
!
!  \note            Note describing the field and its valid values
!
!  \required-field  To flag fields which may not be left blank
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \begin-extensible  Marks the first field at which the object accepts an extensible
!                   field set.  A fixed number of fields from this marker define the
!                   extensible field set, see the object code \extensible for
!                   more information.
!
!  \units           Units (must be from EnergyPlus standard units list)
!                   EnergyPlus units are standard SI units
!
!  \ip-units        IP-Units (for use by input processors with IP units)
!                   This is only used if the default conversion is not
!                   appropriate.
!
!  \unitsBasedOnField  For fields that may have multiple possible units, indicates
!                   the field in the object that can be used to determine
!                   the units. The field reference is in the A2 form.
!
!  \minimum         Minimum that includes the following value
!
!  \minimum>        Minimum that must be > than the following value
!
!  \maximum         Maximum that includes the following value
!
!  \maximum<        Maximum that must be < than the following value
!
!  \default         Default for the field (if N/A then omit entire line)
!
!  \deprecated      This field is not really used and will be deleted from the object.
!                   The information is gotten internally within the program.
!
!  \autosizable     Flag to indicate that this field can be used with the Auto
!                   Sizing routines to produce calculated results for the
!                   field.  If a value follows this, then that will be used
!                   when the "Autosize" feature is flagged.  To trigger
!                   autosizing for a field, enter Autosize as the field's
!                   value.  Only applicable to numeric fields.
!
! \autocalculatable Flag to indicate that this field can be automatically
!                   calculated. To trigger auto calculation for a field, enter
!                   Autocalculate as the field's value.  Only applicable to
!                   numeric fields.
!
!  \type            Type of data for the field -
!                     integer
!                     real
!                     alpha       (arbitrary string),
!                     choice      (alpha with specific list of choices, see
!                                 \key)
!                     object-list (link to a list of objects defined elsewhere,
!                                  see \object-list and \reference)
!
!  \retaincase      Retains the alphabetic case for alpha type fields
!
!  \key             Possible value for "\type choice" (blanks are significant)
!                     use multiple \key lines to indicate all valid choices
!
!  \object-list     Name of a list of user-provided object names that are valid
!                     entries for this field (used with "\reference")
!                     see Zone and BuildingSurface:Detailed objects below for
!                     examples.
!            ** Note that a field may have only one \object-list reference.
!            ** If it must reference more than one object-list, then a
!               composite object-list should be created which contains all
!               valid references.
!
!  \reference       Name of a list of names to which this object belongs
!                     used with "\type object-list" and with "\object-list"
!                     see Zone and BuildingSurface:Detailed objects below for
!                     examples:
!
!                        Zone,
!                          A1 , \field Name
!                               \type alpha
!                               \reference ZoneNames
!
!                        BuildingSurface:Detailed,
!                          A4 , \field Zone Name
!                               \note Zone the surface is a part of
!                               \type object-list
!                               \object-list ZoneNames
!
!             For each zone, the field "Name" may be referenced
!             by other objects, such as BuildingSurface:Detailed, so it is
!             commented with "\reference ZoneNames"
!             Fields that reference a zone name, such as BuildingSurface:Detailed's
!             "Zone Name", are commented as
!             "\type object-list" and "\object-list ZoneNames"
!             ** Note that a field may have multiple \reference commands.
!             ** This is useful if the object belongs to a small specific
!             object-list as well as a larger more general object-list.

!
!  \min-fields      Minimum number of fields that should be included in the
!                   object.  If appropriate, the Input Processor will fill
!                   any missing fields with defaults (for numeric fields).
!                   It will also supply that number of fields to the "get"
!                   routines using blanks for alpha fields (note -- blanks
!                   may not be allowable for some alpha fields).

!           structure -- just add items to the list arguments (i.e. BRANCH
!           LIST). These will be automatically redimensioned and used during
!           the simulation. <#> should be entered by the developer to signify
!           how many of the last fields are needed to be extended (and EnergyPlus
!           will attempt to auto-extend the object).  The first field of the first

!
!  \begin-extensible See previous item, marks beginning of extensible fields in
!                   an object.
!
!  \format          The object should have a special format when saved in
!                   the IDF Editor with the special format option enabled.
!                   The options include SingleLine, Vertices, CompactSchedule,
!                   FluidProperties, ViewFactors, and Spectral.
!                   The SingleLine option puts all the fields for the object
!                   on a single line. The Vertices option is used in objects
!                   that use X, Y and Z fields to format those three fields
!                   on a single line.
!                   The CompactSchedule formats that specific object.
!                   The FluidProperty option formats long lists of fluid
!                   properties to ten values per line.
!                   The ViewFactor option formats three fields related to
!                   view factors per line.
!                   The Spectral option formats the four fields related to
!                   window glass spectral data per line.

!Zone Heating and Cooling Equipment are attached to zones by the following statements:

ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList,
       \extensible:4 Duplicate the four fields Zone Equipment Object Type through Heating Priority
       \memo List equipment in simulation order.  Note that an ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit or
       \memo AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled object must be listed in this statement if there is a forced
       \memo air system serving the zone from the air loop.
       \memo Equipment is simulated in the order specified by Zone Equipment Cooling Sequence and
       \memo Zone Equipment Heating or No-Load Sequence, depending on the thermostat request.
       \memo For equipment of similar type, assign sequence 1 to the first system intended to
       \memo serve that type of load.  For situations where one or more equipment types has limited capacity or
       \memo limited control, order the sequence so that the most controllable piece of equipment runs last.
       \memo For example, with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), the air terminal for the DOAS
       \memo should be assigned Heating Sequence = 1 and Cooling Sequence = 1.  Any other equipment should
       \memo be assigned sequence 2 or higher so that it will see the net load after the DOAS air is added
       \memo to the zone.

\group Controllers
!*****************Controller****************************
! A Controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller, though it
! is somewhat more limited.  It can sense one node variable, compare it with
! its setpoint, and determine the desired value for another node variable.
!
! Rule: A Controller can not span a loop manager boundary (but a Setpoint
! Manager can). Thus in an air loop the sensed node and the controlled
! device must be in the air loop.  This means that a single zone system can
! not be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and
! controlling coil water flow.  Instead this must be modeled as a Setpoint
! Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature
! setpoint each timestep.  This is artificial but should simplify the control
! modelling task.

 !*****************AIR LOOP SPECIFICATION*********************
 ! Air system heating and cooling loops are specified in the following configuration statements.
 ! The AirLoopHVAC input objects connect return and supply air paths from
 ! the zone equipment to supply components on an air loop.
 ! There can only be one return air path per air loop
 ! and only up to 3 supply air streams (assuming a 3-deck multizone is the
 ! most complex supply air configuration) per air system.

  A13  ,  \field Heating Capacity Function of Cooling Capacity Curve Name
            \note The curve represents how the heating capacity of the chiller varies with cooling
            \note capacity when the chiller is simultaeous heating and cooling.  The curve is normalized
            \note so an input of 1.0 represents the nominal cooling capacity and an output of 1.0
            \note represents the full heating capacity (see the Heating to cooling capacity ratio input)
            \note The curve is usually linear or quadratic.
  A14  ,  \field Fuel Input to Heat Output Ratio During Heating Only Operation Curve Name
            \note When the chiller is operating as only a heater, this curve is used to represent the
            \note fraction of fuel used as the heating load varies.  It is normalized so that a value
            \note of 1.0 is the full heating capacity.  The curve is usually linear or quadratic and
            \note will probably be similar to a boiler curve for most chillers.

        \note defined conversion factors are used as defined in the next two fields.
   N1,  \field Energy Conversion Factor
        \type real
        \note Is a multiplier used to convert energy into the units specified by the utility in their tariff. If
        \note left blank it defaults to 1 (no conversion). This field should will be used only if Conversion Factor
        \note Choice is set to UserDefined.  Within EnergyPlus energy always has units of J (joules).  For
        \note conversion from J to kWh use the value of 0.0000002778. This is also used for all objects that
        \note reference the UtilityCost:Tariff.
   N2,  \field Demand Conversion Factor
        \type real
        \note Is a multiplier used to convert demand into the units specified by the utility in their tariff. If
        \note left blank it defaults to 1 (no conversion).  This field should will be used only if Conversion
        \note Factor Choice is set to UserDefined.  Within EnergyPlus demand always has units of J/s (joules/sec)
        \note which equivalent to W (watts).  For conversion from W to kW use the value of 0.001. This is also used
        \note for all objects that reference the UtilityCost:Tariff.
   A4,  \field Time of Use Period Schedule Name
        \type object-list
        \object-list ScheduleNames

        \object-list ScheduleNames
        \note The name of the schedule that defines the billing periods of the year. Normally this entry is allowed
        \note to default and a schedule will be internally used that has the breaks between billing periods occurring
        \note at the same time as the breaks between months i.e. at midnight prior to the first day of the month.
        \note If other billing periods are used such as two month cycles or a single bill for an entire season such
        \note as some natural gas companies do in the summer then the month schedule may be used to redefine it.
        \note Make sure that the month schedule and season schedule are consistent otherwise an error will be issued.

        \key QuarterHour
        \key HalfHour
        \key FullHour
        \key Day
        \key Week
        \note The determination of demand can vary by utility. Some utilities use the peak instantaneous demand
        \note measured but most use a fifteen minute average demand or a one hour average demand. Some gas utilities
        \note measure demand as the use during the peak day or peak week.
   A8,  \field Monthly Charge or Variable Name
        \note The fixed monthly service charge that many utilities have.  The entry may be numeric and gets added to
        \note the ServiceCharges variable or if a variable name is entered here its values for each month are used.
   A9,  \field Minimum Monthly Charge or Variable Name
        \note The minimum total charge for the tariff or if a variable name is entered here its
        \note values for each month are used.
   A10, \field Real Time Pricing Charge Schedule Name
        \note Used with real time pricing rates. The name of a schedule that contains the cost of
        \note energy for that particular time period of the year. Real time rates can be modeled using a charge
        \note schedule with the actual real time prices entered in the schedule.
   A11, \field Customer Baseline Load Schedule Name
        \note Used with real time pricing rates. The name of a schedule that contains the baseline
        \note energy use for the customer. Many real time rates apply the charges as a credit or debit only to the
        \note difference between the baseline use and the actual use.
   A12, \field Group Name
        \note The group name of the tariff such as distribution transmission supplier etc. If more than one tariff
        \note with the same group name is present and qualifies only the lowest cost tariff is used. Usually the group
        \note name field is left blank which results in all tariffs using the same meter variable being compared and
        \note the lowest cost one being selected.
   A13; \field Buy Or Sell
        \type  choice
        \key   BuyFromUtility
        \key   SellToUtility
        \key   NetMetering

        \type choice
        \key Minimum
        \key Maximum
   A5,  \field Threshold Value or Variable Name
        \note The minimum or maximum value for the qualify. If the variable has values that are less than this value
        \note when the qualify type is minimum then the tariff may be disqualified.  If the variable has values that
        \note are greater than this value when the qualify type is maximum then the tariff may be disqualified.
   A6,  \field Season
        \type choice
        \key Annual
        \key Summer
        \key Winter
        \key Spring

        \note it defaults to Annual.
   A7,  \field Threshold Test
        \type choice
        \key Count
        \key Consecutive
        \note Uses the number in Number of Months in one of two different ways depending on the Threshold  Test. If
        \note the Threshold Test is set to Count then the qualification is based on the count of the total number
        \note of months per year.  If the Threshold Test is set to consecutive then the qualification is based on
        \note a consecutive number of months.
   N1;  \field Number of Months
        \minimum 1
        \maximum 12
        \note A number from 1 to 12.  If no value entered 12 is assumed when the qualify type is minimum and 1 when
        \note the qualify type is maximum.  This is the number of months that the threshold test applies to determine
        \note if the rate qualifies or not.  If the season is less than 12 months (if it is not annual) then the
        \note value is automatically reduced to the number of months of the seaon.

UtilityCost:Charge:Simple,
   A1,  \field Charge Variable Name
        \note This is the name associated with the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple object and will appear in the report.
        \note In addition the results of the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple calculation are stored in a variable with the
        \note same name.  That way the results may be used for further calculation.  Spaces are not significant in
        \note Charge variable names. They are removed during the utility bill calculation process.
   A2,  \field Tariff Name
   A3,  \field Source Variable
        \note The name of the source used by the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple.  This is usually the name of the variable
        \note holding the energy or demand but may also be the name of any variable including the subtotal or basis
        \note if other charges are based on those.
   A4,  \field Season

        \note This field shows where the charge should be added. The reason to enter this field appropriately is so
        \note that the charge gets reported in a reasonable category.  The charge automatically gets added to the
        \note variable that is the category.
   A6;  \field Cost per Unit Value or Variable Name
        \note This field contains either a single number or the name of a variable.  The number is multiplied with
        \note all of the energy or demand or other source that is specified in the source field.  If a variable is
        \note used then the monthly values of the variable are multiplied against the variable specified in the
        \note source field.  This field makes it easy to include a simple charge without specifying block sizes.
        \note This is a good way to include a tax or cost adjustment.

UtilityCost:Charge:Block,
   A1,  \field Charge Variable Name
        \note This is the name associated with the UtilityCost:Charge:Block object and will appear in the report.
        \note In addition the results of the UtilityCost:Charge:Block are stored in a variable with the same name.
        \note That way the results may be used for further calculation.
   A2,  \field Tariff Name
   A3,  \field Source Variable
        \note The name of the source used by the UtilityCost:Charge:Block.  This is usually the name of the variable
        \note holding the energy or demand but may also be the name of any variable including the subtotal or basis if
        \note other charges are based on those.

        \key NotIncluded
        \note This field shows where the charge should be added. The reason to enter this field appropriately is so
        \note that the charge gets reported in a reasonable category.  The charge automatically gets added to the
        \note variable that is the category.
   A6,  \field Remaining Into Variable
        \note If the blocks do not use all of the energy or demand from the source some energy and demand remains
        \note then the remaining amount should be assigned to a variable. If no variable is assigned and some amount
        \note of energy or demand is not used in the block structure a warning will be issued.
   A7,  \field Block Size Multiplier Value or Variable Name
        \note The sizes of the blocks are usually used directly but if a value or a variable is entered here the block
        \note sizes entered in the rest of the charge are first multiplied by the entered value prior to being used.
        \note This is common for rates that are kWh/kW rates and in that case the variable that holds the monthly
        \note total electric demand would be entered.  If no value is entered a default value of one is assumed so
        \note that the block sizes remain exactly as entered.  This field is unusual for the EnergyPlus syntax because
        \note it can be either a number or a name of a variable.
   A8,  \field Block Size 1 Value or Variable Name
        \note The size of the block of the charges is entered here. For most rates that use multiple blocks this will
        \note be the value for the block size. Using remaining may be used when the remaining amount should be included
        \note in that block.  This field is unusual because it can be either a number or a name of a variable.
   A9,  \field Block 1 Cost per Unit Value or Variable Name
        \note The cost of the block. This field is unusual for the EnergyPlus syntax because it can be either a number

        \note in that block.  This field is unusual because it can be either a number or a name of a variable.
   A11, \field Block 2 Cost per Unit Value or Variable Name
        \note The cost of the block. This field is unusual for the EnergyPlus syntax because it can be either a number
        \note or a name of a variable.
   A12, \field Block Size 3 Value or Variable Name
        \note The size of the block of the charges is entered here. For most rates that use multiple blocks this will
        \note be the value for the block size. Using remaining may be used when the remaining amount should be included
        \note in that block.  This field is unusual because it can be either a number or a name of a variable.
   A13, \field Block 3 Cost per Unit Value or Variable Name
        \note The cost of the block. This field is unusual for the EnergyPlus syntax because it can be either a number
        \note or a name of a variable.
   A14, \field Block Size 4 Value or Variable Name
        \note The size of the block of the charges is entered here. For most rates that use multiple blocks this will

UtilityCost:Ratchet,
   A1,  \field Ratchet Variable Name
        \note The name of the ratchet and the name of the result of this single ratchet.
   A2,  \field Tariff Name
   A3,  \field Baseline Source Variable
        \note When the ratcheted value exceeds the baseline value for a month the ratcheted value is used but when the
        \note baseline value is greater then the ratcheted value the baseline value is used. Usually the electric
        \note demand charge is used.  The baseline source variable can be the results of another ratchet object. This
        \note allows utility tariffs that have multiple ratchets to be modeled.
   A4,  \field Adjustment Source Variable
        \note The variable that the ratchet is calculated from. It is often but not always the same as the baseline
        \note source variable.  The ratcheting calculations using offset and multiplier are using the values from the
        \note adjustment source variable. If left blank the adjustment source variable is the same as the baseline
        \note source variable.
   A5,  \field Season From

        \key Summer
        \key Winter
        \key Spring
        \key Fall
        \key Monthly
        \note The name of the season that is being examined.  The maximum value for all of the months in the named
        \note season is what is used with the multiplier and offset.  This is most commonly Summer or Annual.  When
        \note Monthly is used the adjustment source variable is used directly for all months.
   A6,  \field Season To
        \type choice
        \key Annual
        \key Summer
        \key Winter
        \key Spring
        \key Fall
        \note The name of the season when the ratchet would be calculated.  This is most commonly Winter.  The ratchet
        \note only is applied to the months in the named season. The resulting variable for months not in the Season To
        \note selection will contain the values as appear in the baseline source variable.
   A7,  \field Multiplier Value or Variable Name
        \note Often the ratchet has a clause such as "the current month demand or 90% of the summer month demand".  For
        \note this case a value of 0.9 would be entered here as the multiplier.  This value may be left blank if no
        \note multiplier is needed and a value of one will be used as a default.
   A8;  \field Offset Value or Variable Name
        \note A less common strategy is to say that the ratchet must be all demand greater than a value in this case
        \note an offset that is added to the demand may be entered here. If entered it is common for the offset value
        \note to be negative representing that the demand be reduced.   If no value is entered it is assumed to be
        \note zero and not affect the ratchet.

       \note The method of aggregation for the selected variable or meter.
       \note SumOrAverage adds up the values for every timestep in the month if the variable
       \note   is a sum variable. If the variable is an average variable it reports the average value.
       \note   This is probably the most common Aggregation Type option to choose.
       \note Maximum and Minimum find the maximum and minimum value for the month and report it
       \note   along with the time that it first occurred.  When Maximum or Minimum are selected a
       \note   column is automatically shown in the output report for the time that it occurred.
       \note   When Maximum or Minimum are used with an average variable the value is divided
       \note   by the length of the timestep.
       \note ValueWhenMaxMin looks at the previous variable in the report that sets a maximum or minimum
       \note   and displays the value of the current variable at that same timestep.
       \note   Order of the variables in the report is important when using ValueWhenMaxMin.
       \note   This can be used when an outdoor temperature should be reported for the time of the
       \note   maximum cooling load.
       \note HoursNonZero adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable is non-zero
       \note   and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour that a fan operates.
       \note HoursZero - The HoursZero option adds up the elapsed time during the month that this
       \note   variable has a zero value and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour
       \note   that a fan does not operate.
       \note HoursPositive - The HoursPositive option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       \note   this variable has a positive value.  Hours with a zero value are not included.
       \note HoursNonPositive - The HoursNonPositive option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       \note   that this variable has non-positive value. Hours with a negative value and hours with a
       \note   zero value are all included.
       \note HoursNegative - The HoursNegative option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       \note   this variable has a negative value.  Hours with a zero value are not included.
       \note HoursNonNegative - The HoursNonNegative option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       \note   that this variable has non-negative value. Hours with a positive value and
       \note   hours with a zero value are all included.
       \note SumOrAverageDuringHoursShown - Provides the sum or average of the named variable when
       \note   during the hours that the previous variable displayed with any of the Aggregation Types
       \note   starting with "Hours". For "sum" type variables adds up the values for each timestep
       \note   and reports the sum of the value monthly during the hours reported on the previous
       \note   variable. For "average" type variables, the value shown will be the average for the month
       \note   during the hours reported on the previous variable.  Order of the variables in
       \note   the report is important when using this Aggregation Type.
       \note MaximumDuringHoursShown - Reports the maximum value and the time that the maximum value
       \note   occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       \note   When the Maximum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       \note   by the length of the timestep.  Order of the variables in the report is important
       \note   when using this Aggregation Type.
       \note MinimumDuringHoursShown - Reports the minimum value and the time that the minimum value
       \note   occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       \note   When the Minimum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       \note   by the length of the timestep.  Order of the variables in the report is important
       \note   when using this Aggregation Type.
