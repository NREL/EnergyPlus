!IDD_Version 8.1.0.009
! **************************************************************************
! This file is the Input Data Dictionary (IDD) for EnergyPlus.
! The IDD defines the syntax and data model for each type of input "Object."
! Lines in EnergyPlus input files (and IDD) are limited to 500 characters.
!
! Object Description
! ------------------
! To define an object (a record with data), develop a key word that is unique
! Each data item to the object can be A (Alphanumeric string) or N (numeric)
! Number each A and N.  This will show how the data items will be put into the
! arrays that are passed to the Input Processor "Get" (GetObjectItem) routines.
! All alpha fields are limited to 100 characters.  Numeric fields should be
! valid numerics (can include such as 1.0E+05) and are placed into double
! precision variables.
!
! NOTE: Even though a field may be optional, a comma representing that field
!   must be included (unless it is the last field in the object).  Since the
!   entire input is "field-oriented" and not "keyword-oriented", the EnergyPlus
!   Input Processor must have some representation (even if blank) for each
!   field.
!
! Object Documentation
! --------------------
! In addition, the following special comments appear one per line and
! most are followed by a value.  Comments may apply to a field or the object
! or a group of objects.
!
! Field-level comments:
!
!  \field           Name of field
!                     (should be succinct and readable, blanks are encouraged)
!
!  \note            Note describing the field and its valid values. If multiple lines,
!                   start each line with \note. Limit line length to 100 characters.
!
!  \required-field  To flag fields which may not be left blank
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \begin-extensible  Marks the first field at which the object accepts an extensible
!                   field set.  A fixed number of fields from this marker define the
!                   extensible field set, see the object code \extensible for
!                   more information.
!
!  \units           Units (must be from EnergyPlus standard units list)
!                   EnergyPlus units are standard SI units
!
!  \ip-units        IP-Units (for use by input processors with IP units)
!                   This is only used if the default conversion is not
!                   appropriate.
!
!  \unitsBasedOnField  For fields that may have multiple possible units, indicates
!                   the field in the object that can be used to determine
!                   the units. The field reference is in the A2 form.
!
!  \minimum         Minimum that includes the following value
!
!  \minimum>        Minimum that must be > than the following value
!
!  \maximum         Maximum that includes the following value
!
!  \maximum<        Maximum that must be < than the following value
!
!  \default         Default for the field (if N/A then omit entire line)
!
!  \deprecated      This field is not really used and will be deleted from the object.
!                   The required information is gotten internally or
!                   not needed by the program.
!
!  \autosizable     Flag to indicate that this field can be used with the Auto
!                   Sizing routines to produce calculated results for the
!                   field.  If a value follows this, then that will be used
!                   when the "Autosize" feature is flagged.  To trigger
!                   autosizing for a field, enter Autosize as the field's
!                   value.  Only applicable to numeric fields.
!
!  \autocalculatable Flag to indicate that this field can be automatically
!                   calculated. To trigger auto calculation for a field, enter
!                   Autocalculate as the field's value.  Only applicable to
!                   numeric fields.
!
!  \type            Type of data for the field -
!                     integer
!                     real
!                     alpha       (arbitrary string),
!                     choice      (alpha with specific list of choices, see
!                                 \key)
!                     object-list (link to a list of objects defined elsewhere,
!                                  see \object-list and \reference)
!                     external-list (uses a special list from an external source,
!                                    see \external-list)
!                     node        (name used in connecting HVAC components)
!
!  \retaincase      Retains the alphabetic case for alpha type fields
!
!  \key             Possible value for "\type choice" (blanks are significant)
!                     use multiple \key lines to indicate all valid choices
!
!  \object-list     Name of a list of user-provided object names that are valid
!                     entries for this field (used with "\reference")
!                     see Zone and BuildingSurface:Detailed objects below for
!                     examples.
!                  ** Note that a field may have multiple \object-list commands.
!
!  \external-list   The values for this field should be selected from a special
!                   list generated outside of the IDD file. The choices for the
!                   special lists are:
!                        autoRDDvariable
!                        autoRDDmeter
!                        autoRDDvariableMeter
!                   When one of these are selected the options for the field
!                   are taken from the RDD or MDD file or both.
!
!  \reference       Name of a list of names to which this object belongs
!                     used with "\type object-list" and with "\object-list"
!                     see Zone and BuildingSurface:Detailed objects below for
!                     examples:
!
!                        Zone,
!                          A1 , \field Name
!                               \type alpha
!                               \reference ZoneNames
!
!                        BuildingSurface:Detailed,
!                          A4 , \field Zone Name
!                               \note Zone the surface is a part of
!                               \type object-list
!                               \object-list ZoneNames
!
!             For each zone, the field "Name" may be referenced
!             by other objects, such as BuildingSurface:Detailed, so it is
!             commented with "\reference ZoneNames"
!             Fields that reference a zone name, such as BuildingSurface:Detailed's
!             "Zone Name", are commented as
!             "\type object-list" and "\object-list ZoneNames"
!             ** Note that a field may have multiple \reference commands.
!             ** This is useful if the object belongs to a small specific
!             object-list as well as a larger more general object-list.

! Object-level comments:
!
!  \memo            Memo describing the object. If multiple lines, start each line
!                   with \memo.
!                   Limit line length to 100 characters.
!
!  \unique-object   To flag objects which should appear only once in an idf

!
!  \required-object To flag objects which are required in every idf
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \min-fields      Minimum number of fields that should be included in the
!                   object.  If appropriate, the Input Processor will fill
!                   any missing fields with defaults (for numeric fields).
!                   It will also supply that number of fields to the "get"
!                   routines using blanks for alpha fields (note -- blanks
!                   may not be allowable for some alpha fields).
!
!  \obsolete        This object has been replaced though is kept (and is read)
!                   in the current version.  Please refer to documentation as
!                   to the dispersal of the object.  If this object is
!                   encountered in an IDF, the InputProcessor will post an

!  \extensible:<#>  This object is dynamically extensible -- meaning, if you
!           change the IDD appropriately (if the object has a simple list
!           structure -- just add items to the list arguments (i.e. BRANCH
!           LIST). These will be automatically redimensioned and used during
!           the simulation. <#> should be entered by the developer to signify
!           how many of the last fields are needed to be extended (and EnergyPlus
!           will attempt to auto-extend the object).  The first field of the first
!           instance of the extensible field set is marked with \begin-extensible.
!
!  \begin-extensible See previous item, marks beginning of extensible fields in
!                   an object.
!
!  \format          The object should have a special format when saved in
!                   the IDF Editor with the special format option enabled.
!                   The options include SingleLine, Vertices, CompactSchedule,
!                   FluidProperties, ViewFactors, and Spectral.
!                   The SingleLine option puts all the fields for the object
!                   on a single line. The Vertices option is used in objects
!                   that use X, Y and Z fields to format those three fields
!                   on a single line.
!                   The CompactSchedule formats that specific object.
!                   The FluidProperty option formats long lists of fluid
!                   properties to ten values per line.
!                   The ViewFactor option formats three fields related to
!                   view factors per line.
!                   The Spectral option formats the four fields related to
!                   window glass spectral data per line.
!
!   \reference-class-name Adds the name of the class to the reference list
!                   similar to \reference.

ZoneList,
       \memo Defines a list of thermal zones which can be referenced as a group. The ZoneList name
       \memo may be used elsewhere in the input to apply a parameter to all zones in the list.
       \memo ZoneLists can be used effectively with the following objects: People, Lights,
       \memo ElectricEquipment, GasEquipment, HotWaterEquipment, ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate,
       \memo ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate, Sizing:Zone, ZoneControl:Thermostat, and others.

       \memo   same elevation but have different air temperatures.  In this case, the mixing air flow
       \memo   between the two zones is determined by the density difference between the two zones.
       \memo   This would typically be used between two zones in a refrigerated warehouse that are
       \memo   controlled at different temperatures.  It could also be used to model a door to a walk-in
       \memo   refrigerated space if that space were modeled as a zone instead of using the object Refrigeration:WalkIn.

       \note Air and control temperatures for heating work together to provide
       \note a linear function that determines the air temperature sent to the
       \note radiant system. The current control temperature (see A14) is
       \note compared to the high and low control temperatures at the current time.
       \note If the control temperature is above the high temperature, then the
       \note inlet air temperature is set to the low air temperature. If the
       \note control temperature is below the low temperature, then the inlet
       \note air temperature is set to the high air temperature. If the control
       \note temperature is between the high and low value, then the inlet air
       \note temperature is linearly interpolated between the low and high air
       \note temperature values.

!Zone Heating and Cooling Equipment are attached to zones by the following statements:

ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList,
       \extensible:4 Duplicate the four fields Zone Equipment Object Type through Heating Priority
       \memo List equipment in simulation order.  Note that an ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit or
       \memo AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled object must be listed in this statement if there is a forced
       \memo air system serving the zone from the air loop.
       \memo Equipment is simulated in the order specified by Zone Equipment Cooling Sequence and
       \memo Zone Equipment Heating or No-Load Sequence, depending on the thermostat request.
       \memo For equipment of similar type, assign sequence 1 to the first system intended to
       \memo serve that type of load.  For situations where one or more equipment types has limited capacity or
       \memo limited control, order the sequence so that the most controllable piece of equipment runs last.
       \memo For example, with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), the air terminal for the DOAS
       \memo should be assigned Heating Sequence = 1 and Cooling Sequence = 1.  Any other equipment should
       \memo be assigned sequence 2 or higher so that it will see the net load after the DOAS air is added
       \memo to the zone.

       \memo Virtual component consisting of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil and an
       \memo air-to-air heat exchanger. The air-to-air heat exchanger precools the air entering the
       \memo cooling coil and reuses this energy to reheat the supply air leaving the cooling
       \memo coil. This heat exchange process improves the latent removal performance of the
       \memo cooling coil (lower sensible heat ratio).

\group Controllers
!*****************Controller****************************
! A Controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller, though it
! is somewhat more limited.  It can sense one node variable, compare it with
! its setpoint, and determine the desired value for another node variable.
!
! Rule: A Controller can not span a loop manager boundary (but a Setpoint
! Manager can). Thus in an air loop the sensed node and the controlled
! device must be in the air loop.  This means that a single zone system can
! not be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and
! controlling coil water flow.  Instead this must be modeled as a Setpoint
! Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature
! setpoint each timestep.  This is artificial but should simplify the control
! modelling task.

\group Setpoint Managers
! We have a two level hierarchy: Setpoint Managers and Controllers.  Set
! Point Managers are simulated at a high level - they resemble the function

! variables and use them to determine the setpoint of any other node variables.

SetpointManager:Scheduled,
     \memo The simplest Setpoint Manager simply uses a schedule to determine one
     \memo or more setpoints. Values of the nodes are not used as input.

Table:MultiVariableLookup,
       \memo The multi-variable lookup table can represent from 1 to 5 independent variables and
       \memo can interpolate these independent variables up to a 4th order polynomial. The
       \memo polynomial order is assumed to be the number of interpolation points (n) minus 1.
       \memo When any independent variable value is outside the table limits, linear extrapolation
       \memo is used to predict the table result and is based on the two nearest data points in the
       \memo table for that particularindependent variable.

UtilityCost:Ratchet,
        \memo Allows the modeling of tariffs that include some type of seasonal ratcheting.
        \memo Ratchets are most common when used with electric demand charges. A ratchet is when a
        \memo utility requires that the demand charge for a month with a low demand may be
        \memo increased to be more consistent with a month that set a higher demand charge.
   A1,  \field Name
        \required-field
        \note Ratchet Variable Name
        \note The name of the ratchet and the name of the result of this single ratchet.

   A3,  \field Baseline Source Variable
        \required-field
        \note When the ratcheted value exceeds the baseline value for a month the ratcheted value is used but when the
        \note baseline value is greater then the ratcheted value the baseline value is used. Usually the electric
        \note demand charge is used.  The baseline source variable can be the results of another ratchet object. This
        \note allows utility tariffs that have multiple ratchets to be modeled.
   A4,  \field Adjustment Source Variable
        \required-field
        \note The variable that the ratchet is calculated from. It is often but not always the same as the baseline
        \note source variable.  The ratcheting calculations using offset and multiplier are using the values from the
        \note adjustment source variable. If left blank the adjustment source variable is the same as the baseline
        \note source variable.

        \note The name of the season that is being examined.  The maximum value for all of the months in the named
        \note season is what is used with the multiplier and offset.  This is most commonly Summer or Annual.  When
        \note Monthly is used the adjustment source variable is used directly for all months.
   A6,  \field Season To
        \type choice
        \key Annual
        \key Summer
        \key Winter
        \key Spring
        \key Fall
        \note The name of the season when the ratchet would be calculated.  This is most commonly Winter.  The ratchet
        \note only is applied to the months in the named season. The resulting variable for months not in the Season To
        \note selection will contain the values as appear in the baseline source variable.
   A7,  \field Multiplier Value or Variable Name
        \note Often the ratchet has a clause such as "the current month demand or 90% of the summer month demand".  For
        \note this case a value of 0.9 would be entered here as the multiplier.  This value may be left blank if no
        \note multiplier is needed and a value of one will be used as a default.
   A8;  \field Offset Value or Variable Name
        \note A less common strategy is to say that the ratchet must be all demand greater than a value in this case
        \note an offset that is added to the demand may be entered here. If entered it is common for the offset value
        \note to be negative representing that the demand be reduced.   If no value is entered it is assumed to be
        \note zero and not affect the ratchet.

Parametric:Logic,
       \memo This object allows some types of objects to be included for some parametric cases and
       \memo not for others. For example, you might want an overhang on a window in some
       \memo parametric runs and not others. A single Parametric:Logic object is allowed per file.
       \memo Consult the Input Output Reference for available commands and syntax.

Output:Table:Monthly,
       \Memo Provides a generic method of setting up tables of monthly results. The report
       \memo has multiple columns that are each defined using a repeated group of fields for any
       \memo number of columns. A single Output:Table:Monthly object often produces multiple
       \memo tables in the output. A table is produced for every instance of a particular output
       \memo variable. For example, a table defined with zone variables will be produced once for
       \memo every zone.

       \note The method of aggregation for the selected variable or meter.
       \note SumOrAverage adds up the values for every timestep in the month if the variable
       \note   is a sum variable. If the variable is an average variable it reports the average value.
       \note   This is probably the most common Aggregation Type option to choose.
       \note Maximum and Minimum find the maximum and minimum value for the month and report it
       \note   along with the time that it first occurred.  When Maximum or Minimum are selected a
       \note   column is automatically shown in the output report for the time that it occurred.
       \note   When Maximum or Minimum are used with an average variable the value is divided
       \note   by the length of the timestep.
       \note ValueWhenMaxMin looks at the previous variable in the report that sets a maximum or minimum
       \note   and displays the value of the current variable at that same timestep.
       \note   Order of the variables in the report is important when using ValueWhenMaxMin.
       \note   This can be used when an outdoor temperature should be reported for the time of the
       \note   maximum cooling load.
       \note HoursNonZero adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable is non-zero
       \note   and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour that a fan operates.
       \note HoursZero - The HoursZero option adds up the elapsed time during the month that this
       \note   variable has a zero value and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour
       \note   that a fan does not operate.
       \note HoursPositive - The HoursPositive option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       \note   this variable has a positive value.  Hours with a zero value are not included.
       \note HoursNonPositive - The HoursNonPositive option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       \note   that this variable has non-positive value. Hours with a negative value and hours with a
       \note   zero value are all included.
       \note HoursNegative - The HoursNegative option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       \note   this variable has a negative value.  Hours with a zero value are not included.
       \note HoursNonNegative - The HoursNonNegative option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       \note   that this variable has non-negative value. Hours with a positive value and
       \note   hours with a zero value are all included.
       \note SumOrAverageDuringHoursShown - Provides the sum or average of the named variable when
       \note   during the hours that the previous variable displayed with any of the Aggregation Types
       \note   starting with "Hours". For "sum" type variables adds up the values for each timestep
       \note   and reports the sum of the value monthly during the hours reported on the previous
       \note   variable. For "average" type variables, the value shown will be the average for the month
       \note   during the hours reported on the previous variable.  Order of the variables in
       \note   the report is important when using this Aggregation Type.
       \note MaximumDuringHoursShown - Reports the maximum value and the time that the maximum value
       \note   occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       \note   When the Maximum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       \note   by the length of the timestep.  Order of the variables in the report is important
       \note   when using this Aggregation Type.
       \note MinimumDuringHoursShown - Reports the minimum value and the time that the minimum value
       \note   occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       \note   When the Minimum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       \note   by the length of the timestep.  Order of the variables in the report is important
       \note   when using this Aggregation Type.
