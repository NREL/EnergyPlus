! Object Description
! ------------------
! To define an object (a record with data), develop a key word that is unique
! Each data item to the object can be A (Alphanumeric string) or N (numeric)
! Number each A and N.  This will show how the data items will be put into the
!  arrays that are passed to the Input Processor "Get" (GetObjectItem) routines.
! All alpha fields are limited to 60 characters.  Numeric fields should be valid
! numerics (can include such as 1.0E+05) and are placed into single precision
! variables.
!
! NOTE: Even though a field may be optional, a comma representing that field must
!       be included (unless it is the last field in the object).  Since the
!       entire input is "field-oriented" and not "keyword-oriented", the EnergyPlus
!       Input Processor must have some representation (even if blank) for each
!       field.
!
! Object Documentation
! --------------------
! In addition, the following special comments appear one per line and
! most are followed by a value.  Comments may apply to a field or the object
! or a group of objects.
!
! Field-level comments:
!
!  \field           Name of field
!                     (should be succinct and readable, blanks are encouraged)
!
!  \note            Note describing the field and its valid values
!
!  \required-field  To flag fields which may not be left blank
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \units           Units (must be from EnergyPlus standard units list)
!                   EnergyPlus units are standard SI units
!
!  \ip-units        IP-Units (for use by input processors with IP units)
!                   This is only used if the default conversion is not
!                   appropriate.
!
!  \minimum         Minimum that includes the following value
!
!  \minimum>        Minimum that must be > than the following value
!
!  \maximum         Maximum that includes the following value
!
!  \maximum<        Maximum that must be < than the following value
!
!  \default         Default for the field (if N/A then omit entire line)
!
!  \autosizable     Flag to indicate that this field can be used with the Auto Sizing
!                   routines to produce calculated results for the field.  If a value
!                   follows this, then that will be used when the "Autosize" feature
!                   is flagged.  To trigger autosizing for a field, enter Autosize as
!                   the field's value.  Only applicable to numeric fields.
!
!  \type            Type of data for the field -
!                     integer
!                     real
!                     alpha       (arbitrary string),
!                     choice      (alpha with specific list of choices, see \key)
!                     object-list (link to a list of objects defined elsewhere,
!                                  see \object-list and \reference)
!
!  \key             Possible value for "\type choice" (blanks are significant)
!                     use multiple \key lines to indicate all valid choices
!
!  \object-list     Name of a list of object names that are valid entries
!                     for this field (used with "\reference")
!                     see ZONE and Surface:HeatTransfer objects below for examples
!                   ** Note that a field may have only one \object-list reference.
!                   ** If it must reference more than one object-list, then a composite
!                      object-list should be created which contains all valid references.
!
!  \reference       Name of a list of object names to which this object belongs
!                     used with "\type object-list" and with "\object-list"
!                     see ZONE and Surface:HeatTransfer objects below for examples:
!
!                        ZONE,
!                          A1 , \field Zone Name
!                               \type alpha
!                               \reference ZoneNames
!                        Surface:HeatTransfer,
!                          A4 , \field InsideFaceEnvironment
!                               \note Zone the surface is a part of
!                               \type object-list
!                               \object-list ZoneNames
!
!                     For each zone, the field "Zone Name" may be referenced
!                     by other objects, such as Surface:HeatTransfer, so it is commented
!                     with "\reference ZoneNames"
!                     Fields that reference a zone name, such as a Surface:HeatTransfer's
!                     "InsideFaceEnvironment", are commented as
!                     "\type object-list" and "\object-list ZoneNames"
!                   ** Note that a field may have multiple \reference commands.
!                   ** This is useful if the object belongs to a small specific object-list
!                      as well as a larger more general object-list.
!
! Object-level comments:
!
!  \memo            Memo describing the object
!
!  \unique-object   To flag objects which should appear only once in an idf
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \required-object To flag objects which are required in every idf
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \min-fields      Minimum number of fields that should be included in the
!                   object.  If appropriate, the Input Processor will fill
!                   any missing fields with defaults (for numeric fields).
!                   It will also supply that number of fields to the "get"
!                   routines using blanks for alpha fields (note -- blanks
!                   may not be allowable for some alpha fields).
!
!  \obsolete        This object has been replaced though is kept (and is read)
!                   in the current version.  Please refer to documentation as
!                   to the dispersal of the object.  If this object is encountered
!                   in an IDF, the EnergyPlus InputProcessor will post an
!                   appropriate message to the error file.
!
!  \extensible      This object is dynamically extensible -- meaning, if you
!                   change the IDD appropriately (if the object has a simple list
!                   structure -- just add items to the list arguments (i.e. BRANCH LIST).
!                   These will be automatically redimensioned and used during the simulation.
!
! Group-level comments:
!
!  \group          Name for a group of related objects
!
!
! Notes on comments
! -----------------
!
! 1.  If a particular comment is not applicable (such as units, or default)
! then simply omit the comment rather than indicating N/A.
!
! 2.  Memos and notes should be brief (recommend 5 lines or less per block).
! More extensive explanations are expected to be in the user documentation
!

 !*****************AIR LOOP SPECIFICATION*********************
 ! System Air heating and cooling loops are specified in the following configuration statements.
 ! The Air Loop Specification syntax connects return and supply air paths from
 ! the zone equipment specification to an air loop specification.  The only
 ! rule here are that there can only be one return air path per air loop
 ! and only up to 3 supply air streams (assuming a 3-deck multizone is the
 ! most complex supply air specification) per air loop.

\group Controllers
!*****************Controller****************************
! A Controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller, though it
! is somewhat more limited.  It can sense one node variable, compare it with
! its set point, and determine the desired value for another node variable.
!
! Rule: A Controller can not span a loop manager boundary (but a Set Point
! Manager can). Thus in an air loop the sensed node and the controlled
! device must be in the air loop.  This means that a single zone system can
! not be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and
! controlling coil water flow.  Instead this must be modeled as a Set Point
! Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature
! set point each time step.  This is artificial but should simplify the control
! modelling task.

            \note value of the curve should be 1.0.  The curve is usually a biquadratic or bilinear
            \note curve with the input variables being the leaving chilled water temperature and either
            \note the entering or leaving condenser water temperature.
  A12  ,  \field Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve
            \note The curve represents the fraction of the electricity to the chiller as the load on
            \note the chiller varies but the operating temperatures remain at the design values.
            \note The curve is normalized so that at full load the value of the curve should be 1.0.
            \note The curve is usually linear or quadratic.
  A13  ,  \field Heating Capacity Function of Cooling Capacity Curve
            \note The curve represents how the heating capacity of the chiller varies with cooling
            \note capacity when the chiller is simultaeous heating and cooling.  The curve is normalized
            \note so an input of 1.0 represents the nominal cooling capacity and an output of 1.0
            \note represents the full heating capacity (see the Heating to cooling capacity ratio input)
            \note The curve is usually linear or quadratic.
  A14  ,  \field Fuel Input to Heat Output Ratio During Heating Only Function
            \note When the chiller is operating as only a heater, this curve is used to represent the fraction
            \note of fuel used as the heating load varies.  It is normalized so that a value of 1.0 is
            \note the full heating capacity.  The curve is usually linear or quadratic and will probably
            \note be similar to a boiler curve for most chillers.

      \memo air stream is the air which is dehumidified. The regen air
      \memo stream is the air which is heated to regenerate the desiccant.
      \memo This object determines the process air outlet conditions, the
      \memo load on the regen heating coil, the electric power consumption
      \memo for the wheel rotor motor, and the regen air fan mass flow rate.
      \memo All other heat exchangers are modeled as separate objects connected
      \memo to the inlet and outlet nodes of the dehumidifier. The solid
      \memo desiccant dehumidifier is typically used in an OUTSIDE AIR SYSTEM,
